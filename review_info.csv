Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Oct 5, 2024~Chris! Chris the cashier is why I'm writing this! He's soooo polite! He's great at customer service and has a beautiful smile! We felt his good energy from the ordering box. His team member made my cousin's coffee wrong. When we came back to get it fixed, he made a fresh one himself!She loved it!Bless Chris!
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Mar 27, 2024~This is one of most the most crowded and worst possible positioned places nearly a wreck a day happens due to the crowded and borderline scary drive thru to go through.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Nov 9, 2023~I received a breakfast sandwich that was missing the egg via a drive-thru order. By the time I looked at it I was already at work. I returned to ask for a sandwich made correctly and the lobby was closed due to understaffing. When I called to request a replacement for my wrong sandwich I was told I had to go through the drive-thru AGAIN and wait 20 more minutes for them to correct their mistake. I asked if they could please just make the sandwich and hand it to me through the lobby door since it was their mistake and I was told no. I walked to the drive-thru window and asked the waiting customer if I could please talk with the store employee (going through the drive-thru) and Kate Young was extremely rude and disrespectful and was yelling at me to get out of the drive-thru. When in fact I did exactly what she said to go thru the drive-thru but I just didn't get in line. I filed a complaint with corporate immediately (took 46 minutes more of my time) so I could at least get reimbursed for the cost of the sandwich. When I asked Kate Young for the store manager's number she could not even provide me with that. Poor shift management and an incredibly disappointing and disrespectful interaction with Kate Young. Very childish and unprofessional. I would recommend going to a different location other than the one at 3110 Zelda Rd in Montgomery , AL.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Sep 5, 2022~Starbucks is usually pretty consistent and enjoyable all the way around. Unfortunately this location is terrible. Went back to back days. Out of stock on many items but that was the least of it.  No line and waited a solid 10 minutes to put in a simple order of two drinks and two sandwiches. Dining area is a mess. Workers look over stressed. Avoid this location and get your coffee and breakfast needs somewhere else. Anywhere else.
Montgomery, AL 36106~4~Nov 28, 2020~I've been visiting this location while on vacation in the area. Very friendly staff! Cheerful voices over the drive-thru mic and my order is always on point!
Montgomery, AL 36106~4~Jun 26, 2018~Coffee, breakfast sandwich and service were all fine.Enjoyed sitting outside on patio enjoying the breeze.Appreciate the option to use mugs instead of paper cups--it makes for a better coffee experience, and is better for the environment.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jun 14, 2021~I'm not sure about the other negative reviews but I was very impressed with the level of customer service and speed at this location. Every employee was exceptionally friendly and professional. I'm not a local but this would be my go to if I lived in the area.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Aug 7, 2021~Everytime I come here my drink is wrong ! I make sure to repeat it and I still get a horrible drink . I worked for Starbucks for 8 years and I've never been to a Starbucks as worse as this one . Everytime I say light  ice they act like it's hindering them personally .Ma'am it's 105 degrees outside and ice melts ! I don't need a half of cup of ice in a grande drink !  They all need to retrain . Whoever the DM is in this area needs to hop on it ASAP!
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~May 28, 2016~Not my go-to Starbucks. I usually walk into a Starbucks. Don't really like the layout or the atmosphere.  I agree with another reviewer that they are not efficient. It takes way too long for a simple black coffee and something from the food case. Probably a solid 5 minutes or more before I got my bagel and it wasn't even that crowded. The most recent visit was the epitome of laziness. Ordered a strawberry banana smoothie for my GF in drive thru and the guy hands me the drink with the top half hanging off. It was like he couldn't be bothered to take a second, take the drink back inside and place the lid on securely. I had to secure the lid myself. C'mon man! Not like there was anyone behind me in the drive thru....
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Mar 4, 2020~I love Starbucks. I was in town today for a funeral. I arrived early so I decided to stop for coffee at 12:30 pm. There were at least 5 people working and I stood there 5 minutes and finally left. It was busy in the drive through but not inside. Worst Starbucks experience. Also it was the dirty and messy. It needs some training and a good cleaning.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Apr 9, 2022~I walked in to find that most of the staff had decided to take a break, despite the long line of cars outside waiting to place an order. I have had recently had surgery on my foot and am using a scooter to get around. The staff kept me standing for several minutes without so much as a `"We'll be with you soon.`"  When they finally got around to taking my order they got it wrong. No wonder the top management at Starbucks has recently had a shakeup--if this is typical, a shakeup was in order. Certainly, this location needs a shakeup.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jun 30, 2018~Good location, clean bathroom, friendly staff, quick service. Located near Publix on Zelda Rd; It wasn't busy at all for 8am on a Saturday morning, so I got in and out quickly.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Nov 23, 2019~They were friendly. But they could not get a single drink in our order correct, even when asked to remake them.  Completely inept. Sweet but inept.
Montgomery, AL 36106~3~May 5, 2018~This second visit was for the Happy hour.  I  had  gotten a Frappuccino and it wasn't that sweet and it had a watery taste, which I don't know why.  I can't say that I love it. It did look good after it was handed to me, but the taste wasn't not enough to say I'm coming back. I did taste the mocha in it, which I was glad and that was only good thing besides the whip cream.  I didn't go wild about this one. That's why I'll be going to other locations , because I know I've had ones way better than this one.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Mar 15, 2020~Stopped through on the road to Atlanta, they had great customer service!! My drink was super fresh and it was just good as hell!!!
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Sep 26, 2019~The staff member `"Ayla`" that helped me this morning is exactly how customer service should be! She was extremely quick, very kind and helpful to a couple requests I had last second. Will come back to this location based on her kindness alonez
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Oct 18, 2020~I worked at Starbucks for over 5 years before the pandemic hit and now I'm a regular at all locations at my area . Everytime I go to Zelda road my drink is made wrong . The staff have attitudes and never wanna correct my drink instead they look at me like I don't know what I'm talking about because they don't know I'm a former partner! I literally only get a dragon drink and add strawberry açaí . And they never fill my drink up or they don't add the ingredients ! I spend $6 twice a day and this is what I get
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Jun 23, 2019~If I could give 0 stars I would! Let me tell you why- JP in the drive-thru was very rude and unprofessional. Upon arriving to the window we asked if any banana bread was available. JP's response to our question was, `"I swear I'm going to kill the next person that comes through the drive-thru.`" After receiving our drinks, JP told us, `"All we're waiting on now is the god-damned banana bread.`" We we're appalled! Horrible service. Never coming back. This took place on June 23rd, 2019 around 4 in the afternoon. JP was also arguing with the person ahead of us in the drive-thru line before we pulled up to the window. Fire him!
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Aug 7, 2014~I am a big fan of Starbucks, Why? I travel all over the country and world and I like trying independent coffee houses but they are always a hit or miss. But with Starbucks they are always consistent and always just right.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Aug 5, 2022~I was in the drive thru line but it was very long and moving slow so I placed a mobile order for DRIVE THRU and once I got to the window the person on the headset told me to get back in line when I've already waited 15 mins to get to the speaker and the line was still backed up to the street. I have things to do and did not have time to get back in line again. So they told me to come inside and I did and I still waited longer than the time it was supposed to be ready so I asked a barista for my order and it was sitting on the counter sweating. It was also made incorrectly but I didn't have time to ask for it to be remade. Great way to show empathy to your customers. I still don't get the difference of ordering at the speaker or ordering a mobile order for the drive thru. I do it all the time and this is the first time I've run into this problem, very disappointed. This happened at about 9am-9:20am on 8/5.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Jul 23, 2021~I went through the drive through on Zelda rd the cashier was very friendly and gave good service, but my drinks awful!!! They got one drink wrong  and the other one was not good wasted $11
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Nov 1, 2018~This location never has organic chai tea, the only thing my wife orders.  I've called, spoken with the manager on several occasions.  Stopped this morning. No chai.  I doubt my wife will ever go back and I doubt the guy at the register cares.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Feb 14, 2018~Skip took care of us. This place is great, they really care about the customer service at this location.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~May 5, 2021~Slowest service in town. Perky will only get you so far. Mobile order pickup from drive through 25 minutes later and they lost my order??? Ridiculous. Cars cutting thru line. They should go to chick-fil-a for training.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Jul 5, 2020~It took legitimately 30 minutes for them to deliver our basic order. They made us feel guilty that there was a line, which is completely out of our control, and it was due to the fact that the woman taking orders took so unbelievably long to type in our information. They also have us the wrong drink despite the lengthy wait. Will not return. Ever.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Sep 6, 2018~Not only is the service slow my items were not bagged,  I bought 3 pounds of coffee that were just given to me without a bag. I also bought a mug which they did put in a bag, with an order of 3 pounds of coffee they should know better and just bag it without me having to ask for one. I think I'll just go to the one on Eastern, it's further away but the service is better.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jan 16, 2018~One of the best Starbucks locations I've ever been to! Excellent customer service - the baristas were so friendly and worked well together. The drinks came out quickly and tasted delicious. Wish more locations were as nice as this one!
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Oct 7, 2020~I have come here three times (Two of the those times I have been made late for work because they wouldn't refund my Starbucks gift card) and will NEVER come here again. They are always understaffed and the few staff they do have are either incompetent or unwilling to work. Every other starbucks I have been to has NEVER had a line out the door or a line all the way out to the street because they are better than this place - and they are the locations I will be going to from now on.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jun 19, 2014~Best Starbucks I've been to.Cleanest, best service.  My husband and I go there at least 5 times a week.  The Manager, Carrie, is beyond reproach and the staff are happy and well-trained.There has been a high turnover of staff over the last few months (graduating and going to College mostly) so we miss the old faces, but the new ones are a pleasure to deal with.I never know what I want, and they have the patience and knowledge to work with me and suggest drinks that I might like - they're great at this :)They are our family and we are so grateful for them - each one adds a little sunshine to our day.  Keep up the great work, guys!
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Nov 14, 2020~Starbucks in Montgomery on Zelda Rd. is one of the worst locations I have been to. They have messed up my coffee well over 5 times now. I go to this location because it's the closest location to my house, but I won't be giving them by business anymore. A few weeks ago, I ordered a drink from there from the drive thru and it wasn't made good at all. Then, I had to go inside to get them to remake it, and it still wasn't good. I ordered a grande drink today and there is about 2.5 inches worth of drink that I paid for, missing from my cup.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Oct 10, 2020~This is the starbucks nearest, but it would be faster to go out the way than this one. It is very very slow, the orders are not normally accurate either. Past two times they've been messed up. It's typically simple orders, too. They struggle with understanding how the rewards systems work, and Ive had a couple times where they use my stars instead of scanning to earn them. It's extremely slow and I've waited 20+ minutes in the drive through for a simple drink.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Jul 5, 2020~Stopped at this Starbucks on our way through Montgomery back to KC, only because w had gained time on our trip. After leaving this starbucks, our arrival time was much later than originally projected. The girl taking our very simple order took almost 15 minutes and decided that while taking our order would also be a good time to take inventory. After ordering, the barista made us feel bad about the long line she had created and even messed up our very simple order. Never returning!
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jul 27, 2019~Best starbucks in all of Montgomery. I've only ever had one or two drinks where the roast has been burnt in all of my years coming here. The staff is amazing, especially Kate, Jasmine, and Ayla. I will drive across town to get my drink from here on my lunch break because the starbucks on zelda is the only starbucks that makes it amazing every time.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Oct 8, 2011~Occasionally Starbucks gets over-brew or burn-the-beans happy, and my Pikes roast cup incurred this fate.Starbucks still serves as a refuge during lengthy travel for it's consistency in pleasant ambiance, lovely service, and food/coffee offerings.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~May 3, 2018~Just had a very bad experience here today. Me and my cousin came to get Frappuchinos for the Happy Hour.  They order, and can't get it because they don't have their Starbucks cards with them (which is understandable because they didn't know).  I order after 1-2 minutes of waiting (Again, understandable since it was busy), and I have my Starbucks Rewards card with me. The cashier tells me that you had to order two in order to get the discount, which, after reading the website, was NOT a requirement. I'm angry at this point, but I still go through with the order anyway because I already came out that way. I don't get my drink for at least 5-7 minutes after my order, even though people who ordered after me had already gotten their drinks. Also, the cashier who took my cousin's order put the order in incorrectly, causing his order to be almost a dollar more than it should've been. Other minor nitpicky things happened there, but this whole experience is enough to have convinced me to not go to this location anymore. If you want Starbucks in Montgomery, go to the Bypass or Atlanta Highway, it's worth the extra gas for better service.UPDATE: Tried the drink I ordered, and it doesn't taste right either. I'm not sure if they used the wrong brew or what, but I've had this happen in the past with drinks that I know should taste different. Overall, a bad experience in general. As said before, I'm not coming back.  If I want a Frappe and I'm in that area, I'd rather just go to McDonalds or Panera.  I've had better drinks at both of those locations than I've ever had at this Starbucks.UPDATE 2: Tried the frap. I ordered the other day from a different location, and now I know that they made basically the entire thing incorrectly. Unless you want bad service and incorrectly made drinks, avoid this location as best you can.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jul 10, 2016~Great place to study. The staff was superb! I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for good lighting and big personal tables.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Nov 21, 2015~Nice staff but not efficient. I ordered a grande coffee with cream and received a tall. And they completely forgot to make one of the drinks in our 3 drink order. The drive through seemed steady but we were the only customers waiting in the store. I don't think I'll be back to this location.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Dec 30, 2016~If I could give zero stars I would. Terrible customer service (could even get a simple order right), extremely long wait, rude employees, &amp; when I asked to speak to the manager about it he was even worse. Will never go back to that place.
Montgomery, AL 36106~4~Apr 21, 2011~This is my favorite local Starbucks. The baristas are nice, remember your drinks &amp; it's a good place to sit inside or outside to chat, meet friends or study.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Feb 7, 2014~It's a management issue.  The baristas are great, most of them... However the way they are treated absolutely sucks.  Talk to them about it sometime.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jan 29, 2017~Always a favorite of mine. Love that they will make a pour over in dark roast when not offered brewed. Great customer service is usually the norm, although all locations are not equal.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Jan 31, 2013~Within the last few months, the vast majority of the highly efficient and friendly crew who had been working at this Starbucks for several years have left. The remaining veterans are trying their best to train the replacements, but it seems to be an uphill struggle thus far. The new barristers have a long way to go before they can come up to an acceptable level of competence and customer service. This is not for lack of trying, but the reality is that this Starbucks has gone from the best one in the Gump to the worst. Whatever you do, avoid this place during busy times. Mixed up orders, long delays in getting relatively simple drinks or snacks ready for the customers, mistakes in entering correct prices into the cash register: the list goes on and on. I hate to be negative, as I really like this place and want it to succeed. It is large (making finding a seat relatively easy) conveniently located to my house, and just a great spot to relax and read or do a bit of work. Until things improve, though, I'm keeping my distance, and encourage others to do the same.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jun 15, 2016~This is my favorite coffee place in Montgomery. All the baristas know my name and my order, and they've always been very friendly and accommodating. They keep it very clean and well staffed, so even when they're busy you don't have to wait too long. There are four leather chairs that are *super* comfy for long study/reading/knitting sessions; I'm just surprised my favorite one doesn't have my permanent butt print in it yet! I could practically live here, so you may as well give it a visit!Edit: I just want to add, I recently overhead two off-shift baristas gossiping about their boss. They were saying how much they appreciate how she treats them and respect her for all the hard work she does to make this store the best it can be. Seriously, at how many chain restaurants do you think the employees chat about how much they like their boss? I know for a *fact* no one says that sort of thing about the owners of Cafe Louisa - quite the opposite, actually. (I don't do it on purpose, maybe it's because I'm quiet, This is my favorite coffee place in Montgomery.

Montgomery, AL 36106~3~Dec 27, 2014~Not as great as they could be. I like this shop, but they don't seem to pay attention to the details of my orders. Often drive to the Vaugh Rd location for a better experience.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Sep 2, 2013~Fantastic staff and wonderful drinks. The service and beverage quality make me want to return daily. I cannot say enough good things. My only complaint is parking is a little lacking, but that isn't a deal breaker.
Montgomery, AL 36109~5~May 30, 2024~I love using the app cuz it makes things faster. They got my drinks correct!!  The line was short and the service was fast and great!!
Montgomery, AL 36109~1~Nov 28, 2024~The customer service was fine, but the drink preparation was consistently disappointing. I had to ask for my drink to be remade three times, yet it still wasn't right. I gave them multiple chances, but after the third visit, it's clear I won't be returning. I sincerely hope they improve.
Montgomery, AL 36109~4~May 20, 2023~I enjoyed Starbucks for breakfast or for later on in the day. My fav that I'm enjoying is the maple butter chicken and egg sandwich for breakfast. Yum!  I also like to try out new different flavors drinks that comes out during different seasons and including coffee. My only complaint for Starbucks is I wish you can add your star points at home, like barcode,  even if you're not able to have them to scan on site. Like give us that option, please.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Nov 16, 2024~Wonderful staff and always make my drinks just the way I like them! Fast and efficient workers who make drinks on time.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Jun 25, 2023~As part of our routine, my spouse and I frequently explore various Starbucks, but unfortunately, consistency has been noticeably lacking over the past couple of years.Upon arrival, my wife placed an order for two coffees while I, anticipating my children's hunger, proceeded to order five sandwiches. Observing the sandwich preparation from a nearby vantage point, I ventured into the men's restroom, only to discover that the lighting was non-functional. Consequently, my children and I resorted to utilizing the illumination from my camera in order to navigate the facilities and wash our hands. Although we managed to overcome this inconvenience, it is disconcerting to encounter such an oversight within a Starbucks establishment. Starbucks, come on? do better...Subsequently, I proceeded towards the designated pickup window, only to find that our sandwiches were not present. After waiting patiently behind other customers, I eventually brought this matter to the attention of the cashier, explaining that approximately 20-22 minutes had elapsed since my initial mobile order. To my surprise, it was discovered that the sandwiches had been placed near the drive-thru window, rather than in the designated mobile pickup area. Furthermore, no prior communication was made regarding the pickup location discrepancy.In light of this experience, I would strongly encourage seeking out local coffee shops whenever feasible, as they tend to offer superior customer service. It is disheartening that, despite spending nearly $50 on coffee and sandwiches, no apologies or attempts to rectify the situation were extended. It is reasonable to expect a higher level of service given the magnitude of the purchase. It really is no surpise why the majority of the reviews at this location are one star.[Review #687]  (11th Review of 2023)
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Mar 30, 2024~I've had Starbucks all over the world and who would've thought I would have the best experience in Montgomery, AL. I stayed near this Starbucks for two weeks and my custom drink was consistently right every day, I was so pleasantly pleased and miss this store already.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Aug 24, 2022~This place is actually laughable. I ordered a chai tea latte with oat milk and I double checked three times to make sure that there was no dairy in it as I've had them put dairy in it instead and only realizing it afterwards once my stomach started hurting. I am vegan by the way. After my third time checking I'm like OK I'm sure they will make the drink right. The lady who took my order kept insisting that there was absolutely no dairy and she seem to be annoyed by me continuously asking. I take one sip of a drink as I get down the road and it taste sour, like in milk taste if you haven't had in a while, and my stomach started hurting. So I go back to the Starbucks restaurant explain what happened and now she's saying oh I thought you meant you only want a splash of oat milk. Are you serious? I can't believe, well actually I can, but still that was very upsetting! I do not trust this place and now anytime I come in I go in to make sure they're using oat milk for my drinks. They are not efficient and I do not recommend.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Mar 22, 2022~Is this the most convenient Starbucks? No. Is it large? Also no. Is it easy to park? Nope. But if you're a Starbucks nut like I am, a `"Bucky`", if you will then you'll maneuver your way through the bumpy parking lot to grab yourself a grande drink and a cookie!  The staff is friendly and tries their best, often they'll put a sign up if any drink ingredient is out of stock.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jun 14, 2019~Great location, whenever I'm at the pep boys getting my car serviced I walk over here. Get a drink, hang out. The baristas are always friendly, I've yet to have a bad experience, unless I count the times they run out of chocolate chip cookies. Lol
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jan 21, 2018~I just had the best experience of any of the Starbucks that I've visited in the recent past.  I was stopping thru and got off at exit 6 on I-85 in Montgomery.  This location is spacious and was very clean.  There is a good amount of sitting room, including high tables. I wanted to try something different since my seasonal favorites are gone.  The young lady, Shawn, listened to me ramble, and after giving me a few suggestions, she came up with the perfect combination for me.  She was more than hospitable when we came in and took her time in recommending a drink for me.  After I tasted it and gave it the thumbs up, she wished us a safe trip to our destination.  The extra minutes that she took to ensure that we had a positive experience and a quality beverage are appreciated!
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Oct 5, 2022~I'm not sure I would even give them a one star. I have given them multiple opportunities to get better sense this is the only Starbucks on my way to work at the hospital. They fail every time. They do not know how to make a proper drink and every single time I go to this location to order some thing, they are out. The nitro machine has been out for three months. Why can nobody run a proper business? I I thought my job as a nurse was challenging, but I guess making coffee is even worse. I would not go to this location if I were you. You're welcome in advance .
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Nov 28, 2023~has got to be the worst Starbucks in Montgomery. will randomly lock its doors because they are understaffed even if you place an online order. shut down the online ordering if that's the case.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Mar 11, 2023~We had very bad experience today at this Starbucks, aside than the fact that they were literally out of everything we wanted cookies, cake pops chocolate milk etc.. but the staff attitude was interesting as if it is normal not to have anything . We won't be coming here again for sure!
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Nov 29, 2021~This place grossed me out. I ran a business and the dots wouldn't get this bad. No toilet paper I soap .I felt like I was going to get sick here . I seriously hope not
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Jun 19, 2022~Really? Out of napkins? Should have read reviews before getting off interstate to come here.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Sep 9, 2019~This is the third time I've had a bad experience with this Starbucks. The first time the situation was resolved and it was great! Second time, different workers but always polite about the issue. This is probably the last time I'll drive to this Starbucks... even if it's only 5-10 minutes from my house. (DRIVE THROUGH) Women asked to take my order. Ordered a Trenta Dragon-drink and Venti Double Chocolate Chip Frappuccino; asked to split the double chocolate chip into two cups. The women repeated my order while I was at the menu and asked if I wanted lemon juice with it... that is where I knew she did not hear me correctly. Dragon drink (Mango Dragon Fruit, no water w/coconut milk). She put me down for a Mango Dragon Drink (which has water instead of the substation for coconut milk). I did not make a fuss about it because it happens and thought nothing of it. WAIT TIME WAS TERRIBLE! There were about 3 cars ahead of me. We sat at a standstill for about 8-10 minutes before the very first car left. Got to the window, paid for my drinks. The women proceeded to re-read my order to ensure I was the correct person that ordered. She read another drink name instead of Double Chocolate Chip... thought nothing of it and assumed it was a simple mistake so I made sure to politely say it was the DCC. Asked as well that if it could be split into two cups. She asked me kindly to hold on and gave me a look of uncertainty. A male barista came over and the women proceeded to tell him, `"This is the one who wanted it split into two cups`". He looked at me and had a bit of an attitude, responded to me saying, `"You know it's only gonna full the cup up half way, right?`". I responded and said, `"Yes that's fine`". (I've ordered a venti DCC split into two cups and an abundant amount of Starbucks. This one just tops the cake). The women gives me my drinks and I assume just like the rest of the other Starbucks, they would come in 2 Grande cups. Wrong haha he gives me 2 Venti cups... On the drive home, I'm just rerunning the situation in my head. Get home to give my husband and my kids their DCC (or so I thought). I went to taste it before giving it to my kids... IT IS COFFEE! The women that took my order got it wrong even after I had politely corrected her not once but twice. I'm home and just over the situation. My husband ends up drinking them instead. I could understand if it was a genuine mistake but for the customer to politely have to correct you twice after you've read the order back is ridiculous. I'm never one to write thorough reviews but this Starbucks is just insane. This is not the first time they've messed up my drinks. Overall, the wait time, miscommunication, and dash of attitude... it would be smart to steer clear of this location.
Montgomery, AL 36106~4~Apr 1, 2018~I've visited this location numerous times over the past few years!  Conveniently located off of eastern boulevard! The staff has always been nice and helpful! A location that won't disappoint in the Montgomery area! I'll be back for sure and the lobby area is great for meetings and relaxing on a cold day!It's also located right up the street from the park, especially since I like to indulge after my workouts Give that blonde flat white a try or for a good post workout smoothie, try the chocolate banana smoothie &amp; you can add as much protein  as you desire.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Aug 22, 2020~They were extremely busy with drive through orders. I went inside to get my mobile order pick up, and they couldn't get my order right. I got three things in total, and after receiving each item, someone asked me `"now do you need anything else?`"  I had to tell them what items I was waiting for. Not a big deal, but not very professional on their part.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Aug 6, 2020~Extremely disappointed. Got off the interstate to grab coffee and snack and use the restroom. They have no food and you cannot use their restrooms. When I asked the guy behind said because there is a pandemic. Hmm.. really. I've been traveling (travel for work) and this is the first Starbucks I've been to that is set up this way.  For them to be so worried there was no hand sanitizer and no napkins and when I went to throw my straw paper away I saw they had their thermometer laying on the trash can counter.  Extremely disap
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Dec 23, 2019~Don't bother with this Starbucks. The staff are obviously miserable and don't seem to mind having customers wait 45+ minutes for one drink. I sat at the drive thru ordering screen for about 30 minutes before I decided to go inside. There was maybe a dozen customers in there. I've seen Starbucks much busier than that and the staff were upbeat and communicated with me. Just search for other locations nearby and go there.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Nov 22, 2019~What a mistake!  Went inside to avoid the drive through line.  Waited 20 min. For two Lattes.  The staff was busy taking care of the drive through and avoided all eye contact with customers waiting inside the store.  We were traveling through on our way East.  We will make a point of avoiding that Starbucks next time through.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Jun 21, 2021~This location is consistently terrible - The worst customer service I've ever experienced in any Starbucks, over and over again. The employees completely ignore you when you walk in and after standing at the order counter for several minutes they finally come over and still refuse to look at you or speak to you.  The Frappuccino I ordered was not mixed at all and not frozen at all.  The drink took a really long time to get and was disgusting.  Done with this location.  I'm sure it won't stay open much longer anyway. Very poorly managed. Can I leave zero stars?
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Feb 11, 2019~Love going to this location! The staff is super friendly and always happy which I love! Tonya is sweet as well! My order was messed up and she fixed it instantly with a smiling Face! For great service must visit this location!
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Aug 2, 2018~Visited this Starbucks today with the family. The service was Excellent and all our questions were answered and there were many. We had two 7 yr olds with us and they loved their drink and food items too. Very spacious and roomy inside. Highly recommend this location.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~May 9, 2021~Don't allow for mobile in store orders if you're drive thru only. 20 min wait for cold coffee and food when we should have just been able to walk in and pickup our food.
Montgomery, AL 36106~3~Jul 11, 2019~The place is conveniently placed near the highway and the staff and products are great. The interior is also clean and relatively modern, however it was pretty quiet and the atmosphere felt a little stagnant. Great to pop in real quick but other than that I wouldn't call it a `"hangout`".
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Jul 30, 2018~@Starbucks I order extra shots for a frap to watch what didn't fit in a cup to go down the sink. Why am I paying for product I don't get? And b/c I've reported this before (and got a refund), now I can't get my money back for product I didn't receive? Ridiculous!!!
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Dec 23, 2019~Took 45 min for my drink. Staff was slow and stood around and talked. At the end of it all my drink was wrong.
Montgomery, AL 36106~4~Dec 17, 2016~This is my second favorite Starbucks in Montgomery. (First is Zelda/Carter Hill). I think that this is the perfect Starbucks to study at. It's never too busy or loud, and the seating is nice with plenty of outlets. Sometimes the coffee isn't the best, but I just think that's because the staff is relatively new. Overall though, a very good Starbucks, and by far the best one if you are looking for some time alone to study or something like that.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Jan 2, 2020~This is the second time I have gone to Starbucks ,and had to wait in the drive thru line for 15 to 20 minutes.i left as soon as I could get out of the line.i left and went to the Starbucks on Vaugh Rd and it only took about 5min. to place and get my order. I dont know what's going on at this location but they SUCK!!!and I will not be going back to this location again ever!!!
Montgomery, AL 36104~5~Oct 28, 2023~Love the team here! They know my order, make me smile when I come in, and are quick! I will go out of my way to come to this Starbucks on my off days instead of other locations.
Montgomery, AL 36104~5~Dec 18, 2021~What a breath of fresh air in a time of such all around saltiness. The store is beautiful and clean and the barista and cashier were remarkable. They were genuine, friendly, and helpful.
Montgomery, AL 36104~5~Dec 29, 2021~Genuinely kind people working there.  Overly helpful.  Brightened my morning!  Great location!
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Jul 7, 2024~6- 13-248:45 AMWas in the area and stopped by here for a jolt of caffeine. When I went to order on the app was surprised as it was the first time I see a size smaller than a tall. Well I am in! Unfortunately you get less but pay what a tall used to cost. This inflation is crazy expensive! I went inside to pickup and you could have knocked me over with a feather as it was sitting there and ready. Thankful for their quick service. I saw no one so it was like people less. Took my cappuccino with me so can't really advise what it is like inside.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Mar 8, 2024~The sweetest people, the person who took my order and also the person who made my order, asked if I wanted whipped cream because I asked for soy milk you go anywhere else, usually they'll rush but not Starbucks. you can tell the managers care about there employees bc it shows !! Also was very tasty.
Montgomery, AL 36116~2~Oct 7, 2023~The service at this location is not so great. Some days the drive thru employees roll their eyes , they answer the speaker box with an attitude, and not to mention how slow they are. I ordered online today because the line was long in the drive thru and my one drink was finally ready 10 minutes after the already 10 minute time it said it would be ready and there weren't many people inside. Even on the days when the line isn't super long in the drive thru, they are still slow. I think I'll start driving down a little further to the East Chase location from now on.
Montgomery, AL 36116~2~Oct 21, 2023~Please spend some time teaching the baristas how to properly pull an espresso shot. I'm tired of bitter coffee
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Sep 17, 2022~This is the only Starbucks in Montgomery that I will go to. My order is almost always right and the wait time is not bad.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Aug 13, 2022~I'm a huge Starbucks fan. I love their drinks. I love being able to customize my beverages. They be so delicious.
Montgomery, AL 36116~3~Dec 3, 2022~7790 Vaughn Road, store is so nasty every time I go inside that I will no longer use the location!  Boxes are stacked high just inside the front door, crusty dirty stains along floor where it joins the counter - have to be months of build up.  I see spilled drinks left on the floor and crumbs, spilled milk on service counters every time I go inside.  My advice is to choose a different location.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~May 12, 2021~The Service at this location has really gone down.  I used to be able to order on my app and they would hand me my coffee when I walked in the store.  Now they won't even acknowledge my presence and I've had to leave because I was going be late to work.  The coffee tends to be lukewarm and far from hot.  When I complain they give me the money back for the undelivered items.   They promise to get management involved but nothing ever happens.Needless to say I do not patronize Starbucks anymore.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Jan 3, 2018~My Husband and I were traveling for the Holidays and decided to use our gift card a Very dear friend gave to us. We pretty much knew what we wanted and ordered in the drive thru. We were not in a hurry since the line was fairly long. Surprisingly the line moved quickly (which in my experience at Starbucks doesn't happen when the line is long)! We pulled up to the window, the attendant scanned my Birthday coupon and our card on the Starbucks app and off we went. He was super pleasant and cheerful. Definitely recommend stopping by this Starbucks if you have a chance.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Nov 27, 2022~This was the slowest and least neat Starbucks I've never been to.  In terms of quickness of ordering: after paying I waiting nearly 20 minutes for my coffee and then left without it not wanting to wait any longer. In terms of neatness: There was at least twenty drinks from mobile orders left adrift on the counter which made it impossible to determine if your drink was there or not. Although it didn't matter because after you looked through them all you would find that none of them were yours.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Apr 4, 2021~The staff was very nice and welcoming. I was very pleased with their sanitation/safety measures they were taking in between customers, and the bathrooms were clean. They were also very efficient in managing the drive through, indoor pickup, and sanitization.
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Feb 24, 2019~I was on a road trip with 2 of my kids, when I decided to splurge (aka cheat on my diet) with a fancy coffee. I had my heart set on the current special, cherry mocha. What are they out of? Cherry mocha. Ugh. I opted for my standard iced coffee, no classic, sugar free cinnamon dolce, and cream. My daughter had a triple mocha frapp and my son had a chocolate milk and a brownie. Store was clean but bathroom had a malfunctioning toilet.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Oct 18, 2019~Every time I visit this Starbucks I am given great, courteous service by friendly employees.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~May 31, 2019~So much is the same from one Starbucks to another -- it can be hard to say what makes one location stand out. But Taylor/Vaughan is a cut above. Recent renovations make it attractive and efficient, and the place is always clean and tidy. It draws a diverse crowd -- and everyone seems comfortable here. This comes down to a crew of baristas that is friendly and caring. They generally want to serve you the drink you want and to make you feel welcome. So whether you want something from the food case, a sweet cream cold brew, one of those super-colorful super-sweet special dragon-unicorn frappacinos -- or just the best short flat white in Montgomery, drop in and sit a spell. The baristas will go out of their way to make your drink right and to make you satisfied. By the way, things have improved dramatically since the remodeling. They seem to have cut away some of the dead wood. Give them a try!
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Feb 10, 2020~Unlike a couple other locations in Montgomery, this Starbucks has plenty of seating and outlets. The WiFi is reliable and the staff is friendly but respectfully quite which makes this a perfect place to work on school. As a grad student, this has become my go-to spot to get writing done. I've also NEVER had a drink made incorrectly and sometimes I have 4 or 5 mods!
Montgomery, AL 36116~2~Jul 24, 2017~This Location is one of my least favorites. I'm finding more and more issues anytime I visit this establishment. My guess is that it suffers like many businesses in Montgomery.......poor management!Today's visit ensured I would no longer use this business for coffee. Two of some popular items: Cold Brew &amp; Birthday Cake Pops were not available.  The Barista even said that they didn't have any cold brew being prepared for future use.  She made some excuse about the Cake Pops, but I couldn't  understand what she said. The Barista was not warm and friendly and lacked any customer service skills. Short of just offering a refund, she didn't even try to retain my business. Now, I know that this may not sound like an issue but I have visited this location several times and it has always been issues to include,  luke warm coffee, weak Americano Coffees and often lazy customer service.  The hot water tap was broken in a few past visits and it remained like this for several months. I complained three different times. I'm not even sure at this point if it had been fixed.  The store is usually dirty and dirty utensils lying about (very evident on today's visit) and just plain nasty. There are other Starbucks stores in Montgomery and it would have been worth the extra 2-3 mile drive down the road to the busy East-chase business.  This store is not a true depiction of the Starbucks name.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Sep 15, 2020~Love my coffee from Starbucks in the morning. They are quick to get their orders out in the drive-thru. They have a great rewards program too.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Dec 26, 2019~I normally drink Starbucks everyday but at other locations , for the simple fact every time I visit the Taylor &amp; Vaughn road location its a disappointment, I waited almost 30 minutes in the drive through to place my order because of how slow they were moving just got me to get to the window and my coffee is not what I ordered . I was polite and informed the cashier that my drink was not made correctly, he had it remade for the SECOND time for it to be still made incorrectly. I did not have a complicated order by far , I told him once again it was not correct , he gave me a look like `"oh well`" and handed me a straw , not once did he apologize or tried to offer something else . I will never return to this Starbucks location .
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Apr 4, 2019~They ran out of chocolate chip cookies :(. But the server was pleasant and polite. I think after 12pm most Starbucks run out of chocolate chip cookies. I wish they'd bring back the toffee-doodle cookies.
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Jul 4, 2013~Folks here are friendly. I'm always impressed when I do not have to explain what a London  Fog is, and they got it right. . .Yes!!
Montgomery, AL 36116~3~Feb 14, 2021~Their frappes are always watered down &amp; I had ordered a mocha frappe, but didn't even receive the drizzle? Go to the Starbucks on Chantilly. They're the best!
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Apr 24, 2020~My husband and I are moving to Orlando today after living in Montgomery for over a year and a half, and this is our favorite Starbucks in the area! We are going to miss it! Montgomery customer service overall is awful, but the employees at this Starbucks always have positive attitudes, and always get our orders right. They are amazing!! We live in East Chase but drive a little bit out of our way to go to this Starbucks because it's worth it! 10/10 would recommend.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Feb 2, 2021~Every time I come to this location my drink is made incorrectly. I tried them again, since they are so close to my work. This time they made my drink wrong three times and argued with me that the menu was wrong. Will not be going back.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Aug 30, 2020~I gave specific directions on how I would like my tea. This barista couldn't even make a simple tea with careful directions. I just left it there. It isn't rocket science. I understand you are following covid recommendations but when you are unable to satisfy a customer's request truly then stop working at customer service industry. I would never recommend this Starbucks.
Montgomery, AL 36116~3~Aug 22, 2015~Conveniently located in the Publix Shopping Ctr off Taylor &amp; Vaugn Roads, this is one of the nicer and cleaner Starbucks I've been to. It's a stand-alone building facing Vaughn Road with convenient drive-thru and pleasant outdoor patio seating.As I do with all my coffee shop reviews, I am grading this one on the following 5 qualities: 1) good, strong espresso (check); 2) availability of Cuban coffee and it turning out well (nope); 3) nice, knowledgeable baristas (check); pleasant and aesthetically pleasing locale (check); and proper utensils for espresso such as demitasse cups and spoons (nope).Therefore, this particular Starbucks earns 3 of 5 stars. My advice to management is they have to-go demitasse cups available for their espresso shots like many other Starbucks do. Serving espresso in big, cup-o-joe type cups cools the espresso too quickly.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Oct 13, 2017~I typically order through the app and come in and pick it up. Normally it's ready when I get there (I live 3 minutes away) and I haven't had any problems. Last time I went they gave me the wrong mobile order. I didn't realize it until I was down the interstate and tried to drink it. Good thing I'm not allergic to cinnamon. Anyway I came went back to the store about two hours later and told them what happened and the barista (didn't get a name) replaced my drink with no questions asked. She was kind and apologized to me for the mistake. I will keep going to this location. Plus it's always the least busiest of the Starbucks around me.
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Sep 5, 2015~Baristas are friendly and courteous. Coffee tastes on par with most other Starbucks locations.It is difficult to hear the barista through the drive-through speaker.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Mar 14, 2019~This has to be among the worst Starbucks stores I have ever visited. I visit this location often because it is the most convenient. However, they are constantly out of many items, the staff is not very friendly and they are slow. I order the same thing everyday but it may taste drastically different from one day to the next. I usually order ahead on the mobile app so I don't have to wait so long but my order is usually not ready when I get there anyway. I keep thinking it will get better but so far it hasn't.
Montgomery, AL 36116~2~Dec 31, 2019~Usually, I am a big fan of Starbucks and what they have to offer, but I believe that this location's customer service is less than par. To skip the line, I usually order through the app. Last time I went to this location, I placed a mobile order almost 20 minutes before I got to the store. When I got there, there were few customers and I actually saw my mobile ticket just sitting there and no staff noticing it. Eventually, I had to go up to the counter and they started it right away. Another time, I had a free tall drink coupon on the app, so I went to the counter and scanned it but it was not processing in the system. I tried showing the cashier my offer, but instead of the cashier helping me figure out the problem, she was very rude and kept repeating that it was not working. With that, Starbucks does offer a variety of drinks and small foods, and I would recommend it to any coffee or non-coffee lover, but I would not recommend this location.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Dec 26, 2019~Don't waste your time here. It's awful. We stopped in and ordered three standard menu items and WAITED for 35 minutes. After 25 minutes, I mentioned something to the barista and I thought she was making our drinks but instead ignored me and proceeded to make others drinks, even after she admitted the labels to my drinks never printed. I got the manager involved and she immediately made my drinks and apologized. I'll never stop at this Starbucks again. It was a disgrace to the company.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Jan 25, 2015~This store is always crowded but sevice is always pleasant and efficient. It has a drive thru and seating area inside and outside seating. They have a large community table - which is often doubling as a mini child care area on weekdays with regulars who bring their toddlers and carry strollers. They have a cozy lounge area with a large couch, leather seats and coffee tables. They have several small tables for two ppl - definitely taken during peak times. Oftentimes it is diffucult finding a place to seat inside. Electrical outlets are in ceilings away from reach. Baristas are friendly and know their trade - it's a treat watching how main barista takes pride in his trade hand-making and mixing teas and expressos. Place is clean and tidy.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Mar 7, 2018~So, yesterday I went through the drive thru. I went to hand my money to the woman.  My arms are not very long and I know I was reaching as far as I could.  I noticed she wasn't making much of an effort to reach any further because she was pregnant.   Which was fine, I tried to accommodate.  She obviously thought I had an issue with how far she reached because she laughed and rolled her eyes.  I thought, `" Oh, I don't want her to think I think any thing of it, so I made sure I said thank you. Which she replied, `"Yup.`"  Now I have a problem.  Enough to revisit the situation in my mind and type this. I don't want to call and complain, I don't want any one fired.  However, if you are that rude or irritable, maybe you should reconsider working the drive thru. Plus, don't assume you know what some one is thinking.
Montgomery, AL 36116~2~Dec 31, 2015~This is usually my go-to Starbucks in Montgomery but today my barista was extremely rude. She didn't greet, was short with her words and after reloading my card and ordering my drinks, she didn't give me any sign of indication that she was complete with my order. Instead she looked at me like I was an idiot and said `"you need anything else?`" So I told her I needed my receipt and she responded `"I can't print at my register, I'd have to go to the one by the drive thru.`" And that is my problem why? I'd rather have someone with better customer service and eager to work take her job. What a waste.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Oct 13, 2017~workers aren't too friendly. put in an order and after we paid they said they no longer sold Carmel macchiatos and didn't offer a refund. my least favorite Starbucks.
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Oct 15, 2016~Favorite Starbucks to shop from. I usually get bacon &amp; gouda egg sandwich and a cool, refreshing blend of juice. This location however seems to constantly be out of strawberry base and sandwiches, so I have to order something else which isn't all thaaat bad considering most things are pretty good on the menu .
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Aug 14, 2015~Friendly staff and efficient drive through. Typical good old starbucks.
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Aug 12, 2011~It's Starbucks...hello....you can always count on the same quality &amp; consistency at ever location &amp; that's what keeps me coming back &amp; back again! Service is always attentive, fast &amp; friendly.
Montgomery, AL 36116~2~Jul 27, 2019~about half the time i go there, i have to throw away my drinks because they taste gross. it's not just my taste buds, either. my friend i was with took a sip of my drink and spit it out into a napkin because it tasted so bad. idk what it is that they do to those beans, but it's not great.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Nov 12, 2017~I ordered the peppermint mocha during their happy hour and I was very specific that I wanted frappuccinos one with and one without whipped topping. The worker repeated the order twice to me to make sure she had it correct and she did! Pulled up to the window and paid then she tried handing me hot drinks. She then continued to roll her eyes and talk to her coworker pretty loudly saying that the order wasn't incorrect and making fun of the order. Worst location in Montgomery.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Jan 24, 2013~At each entrance, there is a sign that says `"Starbucks is a smoke-free environment.`"  So is the outdoor seating area not part of Starbucks?  If it is, why do I see three Starbucks employees lounging and smoking RIGHT NEXT TO THE DOOR?? They also have ashtrays on three of the tables, just inviting people to blow second-hand smoke into my face, should i choose to sit outside and enjoy my Americano in the sun. No thank you.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~May 28, 2024~awful ... drink was not filled up. did not repeat my order. the girl knew she was wrong for handing me this because she just looked at me while i looked at the drink. awful!
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Jul 25, 2022~The new workers have NO customer service skill. The only saving grace is the old staff.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 3, 2021~I walked into the Starbucks this morning after placing a mobile order. Waiting patiently for my order to be prepared. I noticed that there were customers coming in after me getting their order before me. Now I know that orders are prepared in the order they are received, but my order was at the front of the counter and I was being overlooked due to certain customers that came in that looked like they had VIP status. Therefore my order wasn't as important. After maybe 8 customers came and went, they finally decided to prepare my order. Not to mention by then, my banana nut bread was cold now. Needless to say, don't be in a hurry to come to this location as you might be disappointed as I am today. This location has lost my business, I will take it elsewhere.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Oct 3, 2019~Love Starbucks. I mean who doesn't? This location is great, apparently they started putting whipped cream on the bottom and top of Frappuccinos. It's nice. I wish they'd bring back the toffeedoodle cookie. I miss it.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Jul 7, 2018~Starbucks that serves coffee and stuff.  With a drive thru.  And online ordering so it is ready when you arrive.  With friendly people.  What is not to like?
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Jan 24, 2016~This is a clean and efficient location. The staff seemed like they were helping the drive thru customers a whole lot more than the walk ins. We weren't in a hurry so it wasn't that big of a deal. The staff was friendly and my coffee was made perfectly.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Feb 29, 2020~Terrible service. Four orders in a row came out incorrectly. One barista asked if the Nitro Cold Brew was supposed to be cold after the customer returned the hot beverage.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Dec 29, 2014~Cute little starbucks with cozy Inside sofas and drive thru.  Staff is friendly and the drinks were nice.Seems like a cozy neighborhood coffee shop.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 14, 2020~I'm not sure if there's a new management at this location, but over the last 6 months or so, the employees at this location have had a really bad attitude. Not all of them, but most of them. I don't like going to this location anymore because of it.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Mar 12, 2014~The usual very good Starbucks. Quite a distance and no other choices in downtown area. Friendly staff here.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Jun 22, 2015~Starbucks is always awesome. Baristas are great. Only complaint is that the cup seal is off these days with the tall or grande cups.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Dec 10, 2012~They are so friendy there and get in you and out. Michael and David always do everything they can to take care of you. its the best location in montgomery Al.I always get great service in the store or thru the drive way. Thanks John
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Apr 28, 2019~I love this place! I'm here at least twice a week to sip and work. The staff is awesome and super helpful! The facility is always clean
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Jul 16, 2019~I received great customer service from Faith! She was so sweet and informative when I asked her questions for my future visits! I got a vanilla bean creme crap with  strawberry inclusions and it is sooo good! Definitely recommend!
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Dec 8, 2016~This Starbucks is average. I usually only go there because it's close my job but I'd pick the one in Zelda or east chase if they were closer. Don't use the re-pay mobile option. You'll ether get your coffee in 2 minutes or 25 minutes ... since I can't gamble I only use them if I have 15 minutes to spare in the morning.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Jul 18, 2015~The service is friendly and the drinks are made well, which is what you should expect from a typo a Starbucks.  However, it is very noisy here at all times.  Since the seating area isn't spread out, you'll have a lot of people right next to you having loud conversations and you have nowhere to go.  Also, the employees are pretty loud in general.  On top of all that, it's kept very hot here inside.  I've been sweating for the past two hours while doing homework, so I'm leaving for another place.  Not recommended if you want to do work or study!
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Aug 1, 2015~I miss the Starbucks I so used to love---Luke warm coffee and over priced cardboard pastries
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Jul 10, 2014~As usual Starbucks is always good. This place has good service and continues to impress me. It would be nice if the prices would drop, but majority of the time my coffee is perfecto! Of course I enjoy warning points on my mobile card app for paying with it. Starbucks changed a lot of things. I'm not addicted to them, but they're good for an occasional visit!
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Mar 10, 2013~Superior service. Friendly, efficient. Only a blow dryer in the bathroom though.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Dec 28, 2014~I really enjoy this location greatly. A majority of the workers are very personable and remember your name when you stop by. Usually pretty quick and always pleasant.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Feb 11, 2021~The wait at this location is still too long for a $5.00 cup of practically anything.  .Not much else to say except i love the Nitro
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 29, 2024~Insanely slow with terrible customer service. Restaurant and restrooms were dirty...store is barely stocked.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Oct 28, 2023~I wouldn't even give a 1 star if I didn't have to. Terrible customer service. Was ignored and they clearly saw me as they walked back and forth several times. Then they refused to give me my own receipt. Made me grab it from the printer. Pathetic and not friendly at all.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~May 29, 2023~On our way back north from a Florida vacation, we stopped by this location to use the facilities and get our Starbucks pick me up and snack before the last homestretch. Upon arriving, the restrooms were definitely in need of a freshen. That's not a huge deal, though. Just something I observed. When I placed my order of (1) drink and (2) snacks (egg bites &amp; a donut), I asked the barista to make sure the bacon Gruyère bites were still available and she said they were. I paid for my order and all was well. Sliding down the line to wait for the drink and food, I was delivered the donut and coffee, and my sister who had placed a second order received hers. Being a loyal customer of SB, I know those egg bites can take a minute so no worries. However, 10 minutes passed and still no egg bites. We were the only 2 waiting on anything inside the store at that moment. All 4 employees behind the register were working drive through and taking more in person orders, completely ignoring the only person standing at the end of the line waiting for food. 15 minutes, still nothing. So I managed to get one of their attention's and asked to check on them where she replied `"I'm not doing the food line so I don't know.`" To which I respond with `"okay, we'll... can you check on it?`" And she says `"yes.`" So I watched her fulfill a few more orders and then ask someone else about the bites. At this point I've been waiting over 20 minutes. They come back to me and ask `"what was your name again?`" And after scrolling through the orders and finding mine (Emily) - they proceed to tell me that the order was never put in for those. `"But we can ring you up for them and make them for you now.`" My reply was `"that's okay. I've already been waiting 35 minutes. I can do without them.`" I get that these things happen. The disappointment was the lack of concern and the blatant ignoring that happened during the near half hour wait. One of the baristas (wearing her Starbucks visor backwards AND upside down) walked past us at least 10 times, looking, and never even acknowledging. It was really a site. I was pretty sure I was invisible at one point. The last thing I want to mention is the state of the store itself. There weren't any napkins, boxes of food/merchandise was piled 10 feet high near the entrance, and there wasn't a single pleasant person in the place.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jan 7, 2023~If I could give them zero stars I would. Worst branch in Montgomery. Long wait and at the end the drink is not worth a dollar.  Went straight to the trash. Asked for a White Chocolate Mocha and server asked if I wanted coffee in it -- `"Mocha`"Is coffee . In the end it tasted like nothing but frothed milk , after waiting in line for about 20 min . This branch needs help!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Oct 8, 2022~mobile ordered bc I tow a teardrop. Lobby was closed and I had to wait in the drive through line - with my camper - to get to the window. WHY?!? Turn off mobile orders if you refuse to open the door.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Sep 10, 2022~Wish I had read all of the bad reviews before getting stuck in line here. Once you get in line you can't get out. They don't seem to care if they get your order right. Asked for a very small splash of cream and I got half the container. Told the drive through person it was too much and their response was just, `"sorry`" as they were handing it over. No offer to fix it. Definitely will avoid this place in the future. Waste of time and money.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 1, 2021~Disgusting. Bathrooms are gross. They're all standing around doing nothing they have plenty of time to clean a bathroom. No soap in the bathrooms. They all need retraining and need a better atmosphere overall
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Sep 9, 2021~Awful customer service. Entire store closed mid day with no explanation. Totally unreliable.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Mar 12, 2021~I sat in the line for a good 30 minutes. It was ridiculous. The car in front of me was there for about 15 minutes and you can't leave because of the way the drive thru is setup. If you're in a hurry don't go here!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Oct 19, 2019~Nasty! But service is ok ... Staff seemed preoccupied... Not sure why but the manager seems to be on top of things! The place is very busy! Hey Starbucks Corp.... help this place out! You have a good clientele.... how bout a store upgrade?
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~May 15, 2022~Wish I had seen the other reviews before we stopped here. Trash in the parking lot. A noxious music playing outside at 8 in the morning. Bathrooms were dirty and had no soap or toilet paper! We ordered a regular coffee and an iced coffee and they were terrible. Way too much cream in both and hardly any ice in the iced coffee.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Aug 12, 2022~Literally the worst starbucks in montgomery. Ive waited twenty minutes inside for an online order and they will let you just stand there without asking about your order. Just go to the chantilly starbucks a few minutes away. They are 10x better. I don't know why i keep coming here. I would give zero stars if i could.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Aug 19, 2021~Starbucks coffee is awful!  I don't know how they stay in business the way they burn their beans. I love my coffee strong but this is bitter and definitely has a burnt flavor. There's better coffee out there y'all. Take the time to go find it!!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 10, 2021~The manager Iesha was extremely rude to me . After trying to get a drink remade she asked me to pull up without asking me what the drink was or what was wrong . when I get to the window she then says well where you got it from? I informed her I worked for Starbucks for 6 years and the customer is always right . Why am I being interrogated about a drink that's full and I'm telling you it's not right .its sad the display that she's putting on for the baristas on her team . I loved this Starbucks and I come everyday . But I will find a new location .
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Apr 11, 2021~By far one of the worst Starbucks's I've ever been to.  15 minutes after we ordered the lady told us that two of their machines were down and they didn't have cold brew which is one of the drinks we ordered.The cashier was unsure how to process the refund. After 25 minutes they gave us our beverages which tasted terrible. Will never go back.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Feb 8, 2018~I have visited a fair share of Starbucks shops and this one easily has the slowest moving employees.  I visited at about 5:45 a.m. via the drive thru.  I ordered a dopio espresso with three pumps of white mocha (my own favorite concoction to get my day started).  There was only one other vehicle in front of me and it still took a good 9-10 minutes for each of us to receive our orders.  I initially figured that they could be understaffed at such an early hour; but, when I reached the window, I realized that there were three employees working.  Selfishly, I'm glad I was only in the area for a business trip and that this is not my local Starbucks.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Dec 25, 2015~The service here was very slow for the inside customers. It seems that most of their efforts are aimed at moving the traffic through the drive thru. I did enjoy the overall look of this place. They have some cool art hanging on the wall. I did appreciate that my coffee was made extra hot. The parking lot is a hot mess

Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Feb 26, 2018~Always fast and courteous, the Starbucks at Eastchase is my favorite Starbucks to frequent. They always have a large variety of baked good, Sweets, and boxed lunches to purchase if hungry. I'm really enjoying the less bitter espresso they carry now called `"blonde.`"
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Mar 19, 2022~You wait for 20-30 minutes. I understand being understaffed completely and we aren't living in an easy world right now. But if you can't properly staff your business to where it functions well, then cut hours or close until you can. I know it's tough love but waiting 20-30+ minutes is horrible. PLUS! You can't leave the line. I was 20 minutes late for work after showing up 20 minutes early in the line before. Plus I work in eastchase.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Sep 8, 2019~There's a clear reason why this location has low ratings. The drive through takes 25-30 minutes solid to get a drink. Going in isn't any better, you'll wait about the same time. Than you'll receive a drink that isn't made right and when you ask them to fix it they'll tell you it's right.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 6, 2019~Ugggg!! We always stop at StarBucks for special occasions. We've traveled literally all over continental US &amp; Europe. Always know we can depend on StarBucks for wonderful, relaxing special coffees. WRONG.  Ordered our usual Venti Cafe Mocha. Got back on the Interstate (in Montgomery AL heading towards New Orleans) before taking our first sip. UGGGGG!!!!  Day old coffee at a quick stop would have been better!!! WASTED $5 per mug!!!  Please fellow travelers &amp; StarBuck lovers -- DONT STOP HERE!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 25, 2021~Extremely long wait with 6 people in line.  25 minutes just to get the order in and could not get out of the line.  I have never been to a Starbucks this slow.  Very nice staff but not a quick location.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Jul 26, 2020~Seen hazmat suits here and no news as of what is going on. Decent service but with COVID 19 on the rise and them not being able to discuss why it looks like a scene from Monsters Inc I think I will pass moving foward.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jun 18, 2021~Just stopped in this Starbucks. The store was filthy. No napkins available. No toilet paper or soap in the women's bathroom. And a HUGE dead cockroach in the bathroom. I quietly told the person behind the counter about the cockroach, the lack of toilet paper and the lack of soap. All I got back was a disinterested `"okay.`" No I`"I am sorry.`" Oh and when I got back out to my car I discovered that they got my food order wrong. We are on a long car trip and normally I can count on Starbucks to be a quick stop with consistent product - but I will never again go to a Starbucks. They have gone downhill and are losing their brand identity.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Apr 24, 2014~This is a standard 3-star Starbucks. My venti caramel macchiato with soy milk was made correctly, but the customer service was awesome. The baristas were so upbeat. It has been a while since I stepped in a Starbuck's with this kind of energy. As a matter of fact, I always visit this Starbucks when I am in the area. Like many Yelpers have stated, the parking is crazy. I have become used to the parking because I adore this location. On a great note, it is off of I-85, so it is easy to get your drink and get back to traveling.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Feb 6, 2015~Starbucks + Clover = Greatness!Large interior is usually full of people and has the positive energy of a bustling cafe. They recently got a Clover coffee maker - brewed single-serving coffee on demand. The coffee this machine puts out will blow your mind! They grind the beans fresh when you order and space-age technology yields the best cup of coffee I've ever had. Super-friendly staff, plenty of seating, and a convenient location make this my go-to coffee fix and study spot.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Nov 2, 2020~Whoa. The place needs to be cleaned. The toilet in women's room did not work. The iced coffee was translucent, I. e., not the real Starbucks Iced coffee. YUCK
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Feb 20, 2018~My favorite PokémonGo playing spot. Oh yea and the coffee is cool . The main downside about this Starbucks is that I dont think they anticipated it to be so popular or busy. The parking can be horrible/hazardous depending on the time of day/night. And of course the traffic is ridiculous during the morning and evening rush. I'm not really sure if this is Starbucks' fault or Eastchase's. I know people sometimes park in the chick-fil-a parking lot or another neighboring restaurant and walk over. But because there are no sidewalks or crosswalks it could be potentially dangerous. I really wish Montgomery would get it together and allow the city to be a little more metropolitan with a southern flair. But this Starbucks location is great, really close to the interstate and great shops. The staff is usually friendly, there's always at least one person who may be having a bad day. But hey, we're human. I've only had my order messed up about 5 times from all the years I've been coming to this one.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 28, 2019~Stuck in the drive through circle again for 20 minutes ...... it should take this long to make coffee!! Outrageous! People are getting out carrying their kids inside to use the restroom since they're also stuck in the circle! Don't do what I did and think they have their shit together! They don't!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Dec 10, 2018~Accidentally came to this location again! They have one bar open which they placed with in the drive thru circle which doesn't allow you to leave it once another car is behind you. Therefore, I am once again stuck in this circle of hell! Why not place a sign before people are in the circle? Bad management! I see they are rated so low! Please don't come to this location, you'll regret it!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 18, 2018~At Starbucks at 3:59 and get told they are out of white chocolate mochas the most basic drink... and have to sit and wait for a huge van since I can't go around! Will never visit this location again!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Mar 22, 2019~Omgeeeeeee this is the worst Starbucks that I've ever been to!! It took them like 5mins to come to the register to take my order. He got my order wrong also it took another 25 mins for me to get a drink, 2 danish and a sandwich! Smh everyone inside was complaining and they acted as if they didn't even care!! I wish I could give them no stars at all!!!
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Feb 25, 2018~If you are looking for a chill place to hang out and read or chat with a friend this place is NOT it. The music is blaring. The inside of the facility is showing its age and there is not much seating. They lost my drink order today as well. The only redeeming quality was that as soon as I brought it to their attention they got me my drink pretty quickly. If I come back here it would only be for going through the drive thru. Oh never mind, I just read some other reviews and found out the drive thru sucks too!
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Nov 24, 2017~Very friendly Starbucks staff. Currently only 8 Starbucks are designed with a round bar &amp; mobile pickup counter in the middle. The Starbucks designer is no longer employed . We purchased 2 reduced fat turkey bacon egg white sandwiches. He said tasted like made from scratch. Also purchased a Grande Americano with Steam , it was good also. The bathrooms were clean &amp; parking was ample.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 23, 2020~I know it's covid  times but how hard is it to have clean toilets and paper towels in the bathrooms... how hard is it to have clean floors.... and HOW HARD IS IT to get me one cup of coffee within 15 minutes??????  AND WHY ARE YOU GRABBING THE COFFEE CUP WITH THE  YOUR FINGERS FROM THE INSIDE OF THE CUP????? Never coming back to this Starbucks again.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Nov 23, 2020~After getting having my vehicle hit in the parking lot and failing a final exam, I pulled up to get a pick-up for another long night of studying. To my astonishment, one of the store managers, KC, gave me a free nitro cold brew on the house. It's little things like this that make a huge difference, especially for a doctoral student with student loans that'll take years to pay back, and every dollar counts. Next time I go through I plan on paying it forward and paying for the vehicle behind me. Months ago, I couldn't stand the service at this Starbucks. They've made plenty of improvements since!!
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Sep 19, 2018~This is by far the best Starbucks I've been to, the staff is supper friendly, and a young man that goes by the name Tanner is a very busy (always running around)The only problem I see currently after visiting more then a handful of times is the fact that the night shift he works is understaffed, and It gets beyond busy some nights. Customers get rude but Tanner keeps his composure very well, The crew he works with struggles some nights, and I do wish this changes for the better.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Mar 13, 2013~This parking lot is a nightmare. The layout is completely bonkers. I was about to leave, but luckily found a spot. The atmosphere was pretty typically for most Starbucks. Not a lot of study tables. The store section with mugs and such was fairly disorganized and not well stocked.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Aug 6, 2019~Horrible COFFEE! old and full of grounds. Are you kidding me Starbucks. I am a fan but will not be back to this location ever.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Dec 22, 2012~Drive thru people.Everything you would expect from a Starbucks here.  Top quality.The parking can be a fustercluck when crowded though.Personal note, this is where I met fellow Yelper Holli D. IRL.  Yelp makes the world a little bit smaller :)
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 9, 2020~It's amazing they closed the bathrooms, like COVID 19 makes you not have to go!!  I'll be buying my coffee on trips somewhere else!!
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~May 22, 2011~Reliable Starbucks is right here in East Chase. No complaints, just a suggestion about moving the tables and chairs around to make it a little more comfy and homey. The lounge chairs outside are great too...need to rearrange them for a better feel. I'll come over and do it for you if you need help :-)
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Feb 26, 2017~Five cars in line at the drive through, it took 27 minutes to get my drink. Sooo sloowwwww.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Jan 3, 2020~Subpar service with my subpar drink. Their lack luster staff were rude with me over my first order because I made a mistake of not knowing about coffee which is apparently holds the utmost importance to the universe's stability, or so they think. I genuinely understand dealing with difficult people, but instead of attempting to help their customers they were incapable of being patient enough to help me in finding a decent cup of coffee which is the only purpose of their corporations existence. I however do not believe the staff is solely to blame because Starbuck's coffee is bland and lacks the ability to stimulate any sense other than `"bleh!`" In writing this review I realize the truest mistake was my choice in coffee places.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jan 14, 2017~Too crowed! We got stuck in the drive through line have no choice and can't turn around. Not worth the wait.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Jan 15, 2017~Beware ordering a pour over. Or keep reminding them. I stood there for ten minutes before I asked if they had my pour over that I was told would take three minutes. The barista then just started to look for the beans. I asked if she was doing the pour over, she said she was just fixing to start it now. No thanks, just give me whatever you have ready, cuz I can't wait another ten minutes (commuting home with dogs in the car). Ridiculous.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Oct 5, 2019~Ridiculously slow... and no way to leave once in line. So don't get caught in the drive thru trap unless you've got a good 20 minutes to wait
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Mar 28, 2014~The morning rush and kick start, nice folks, quick coffee it works.It is next to some very busy fast food establishments so parking can get a little crazy but I manage.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Mar 11, 2017~On a roadtrip &amp; had to wait over 30 minutes stuck in drive thru with 5 cars.  3 people working inside &amp; it was dead inside. Such slow service.  Then the order was wrong when we got to the window.  I could hear them constantly talking as we were waiting for them to fix the order.  We travel to many Starbucks over the US &amp; never seen one take so long.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Feb 4, 2017~Terrible. Every time I go there and order they are alway `"out`" of every sandwich I order. And I refuse to just order whatever they have. I want what I want! Overpriced. Not worth the money or time waiting in line
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Aug 11, 2019~This is the best Starbucks I have been to! They made my coffee just as quick as how long is took to order it a the register. All the workers have genuine smiles on their faces and really go out of there way to help you if you are indecisive! They even spell names right here! One of the employees in particular who made my coffee (honestly, the best caramel macchiato I have ever had!), Kayla, didn't just put my coffee down say my name and started on her next drink. She made sure it made it right in to my hands and delivered it with the biggest smile. I wouldn't expect such an experience but boy was it refreshing! Thank you to all the Starbucks employees for your service! Would recommend everyone to check it out, and give these motivated people a raise! They deserve it!
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Dec 23, 2018~Accidentally wrote a review for the target location down the street from this one...To some it up, Came in Sunday Morning 23 December 2018, Appearance NASTY, front door, first foot in the door trash NASTY with 8employees behind the counter..Bottom Line Up Front..Manager needs to care
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jun 26, 2019~This Starbucks is terrible. There are boxes all over the lobby. They forgot my friends drink and never even apologized. The bathroom is filthy and smells.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~May 9, 2017~I'm not sure why I am even bothering with this review....Star Bucks is too big of a chain and they make LOTS of money off of people like me even when I'm complaining, so why would they make any adjustments to the way they do business when bad customer service and `"okay`" tasting coffee makes them millions. Nonetheless I rated this place as 2-star because it doesn't matter what time of the day or what day of the week it is, you will still wait....and wait...and wait for your coffee. So if you have a lot of free time, then this is the place for you. It's in the East Chase shopping center so it can be very busy in the parking lot. And speaking of parking lots, it is the most convoluted parking lot I've ever seen. Be wary of other vehicles trying to maneuver their way around. They have a nice outdoor area...however if you like the smell of car exhaust then take a seat. The drive through loops around right by the outdoor seating. Boo. This is a smaller than average place and seating is very limited. Would recommend getting your coffee to go. Enjoy!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Oct 29, 2018~Traveling through Montgomery with my family. We pulled through for an afternoon treat. When taking my order, the  lady was very rude and `"bothered`" like I was taking too much of her time. They were out of chocolate croissants. Okay...no big deal...I can order something else. I placed 5 drink orders. It took nearly 20 minutes to get our drinks. The blonde flat white was basically water with milk added in. I had to pour it out. What a waste of money!! I should have trusted the 3* reviews before we came here. Besides the order being poorly made, the lady at the window barely made eye contact and was clearly not happy about being at work today. Then don't show up! If I acted this way at my job, I wouldn't get to stay long. We pass this way often, but won't be visiting this Starbucks again. It's a shame.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Mar 13, 2019~I frequent many Starbucks locations while traveling. This location is mediocre. The drinks are OK, service is decent. But the inside areas are always dirty. Napkins and straw wrappers on all over the place. Trash is generally overflowing. Not where I would want to spend time working and enjoying coffee. Staff always seem more concerned with hanging out with each other than cleaning up. Every other Starbucks I have been in will usually have associates cleaning when there are no customers.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 20, 2018~SLOWEST STARBUCKS EVER. Unbelievably long lines in drive thru, takes forever to get order. The location is clearly short staffed, which makes no sense since it is very busy. I hope someone wakes up and properly staffs this location, as it is very conveniently located.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jan 13, 2019~I just waited in the drive through for 30 minutes. By far the worst Starbucks experience ever!
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Jan 31, 2010~Typical starbucks.  Can be crowded at times due to location next to Eastchase.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~May 2, 2015~Its always nice to find a Starbucks wen you need it and this place was very easy to get into their drive through and get our drinks. Easy in and out.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Mar 12, 2016~Just waited in the drive thru line for 20+ minutes. Starbucks is some of the best coffee around but not worth the wait and no apology from the drive thru attendant. I have only tried this Starbucks one time but am hesitant to go back. The Smoked butterscotch latte and iced Americano tasted watered down.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Sep 14, 2015~Last night on the way home from Auburn to Pensacola I stopped at Starbucks drive-through to grab something to lift me up for my long drive. I spent 30 minutes in line I use the app to order my drink.  Horrible horrible place to do a drive through and lose 30 minutes of your time when you're trying to get somewhere. The girl at the window said they were shorthanded while I was trying to call the store to find out why the line was so backed up and no one would even answer the phone.  it looks like whatever management that supposed to be at the store has left the building. Once in line there is no escape.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 11, 2020~Go through the drive through and pay with credit card. Employee forgets to hand back my card. No big deal I noticed right away but had already left the parking lot. So I circle around and walk back into the store. Inside service was limited to just 1 person it was just me and Starbuck employees. I asked for my credit card, their response was `" we don't have any credit cards`". They challenged me on how long was that you left it here. My response about 5 minutes ago. Nobody really stopped to look for it. After refusing to leave they find it and the employee walks over to me. He says here it is and I ask is there anything you would like to say. He looked totally confused, no sorry we didnt give you your card back or sorry for the inconvenience or sorry we called you a liar. Clueless customer service, everyone makes mistakes no big deal but you step up. Once again substandard service from a clueless company.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Mar 26, 2020~This used to be my go to location when I wanted Starbucks, but recently the service has been absolute trash. On more than one occasion I've had to wait an excessive amount of time to get my coffee. By excessive amount of time I mean longer than 30 minutes for a single Frappuccino. On one occasion I even placed a mobile order which said would take 10 minutes. After arriving at the store roughly 8 minutes after placing the order I still ended up waiting another 35 minutes. The staff did not appear to be making drinks with any urgency, instead they seemed to be moving at a quite leisurely pace taking extra time in between making drinks to chat (and from what I could hear the conversations had nothing to do with how to make any of the drinks or anything. The morning shift seems to be somewhat quicker, and by somewhat I mean I only have to wait 15-20 minutes for a drink instead of 30-40. I've even witnessed on occasion staff members berating another staff member while that staff member was trying to help a customer. The only time I will go back to this one is if I'm just really craving a Starbucks drink while I'm near this store, and even then I might just drive the extra distance to either the Taylor Rd. location or the Atlanta Hwy. location.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Sep 8, 2017~I ordered 6 cups of coffee yesterday for a client. 3 of them were wrong and needed to be remade. It was supposed to be a cafe vanilla frapacinno and it was a vanilla bean frap. No big deal. One of the staff seemed upset that 3 coffees needed to be remade and walked up towards me to take the 3 cups away. Not a big deal except The vibe I got from him was unpleasant, that I was lying and was trying to get free coffee because he didn't say I'll take this away, he just took it from my tray without no apologies. I mean. Come on. Do I look like a piece of . I don't need a free drink. Apologize for making the mistake and treat me the customer, someone that pays over $150 every month at your establishment with more respect.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Apr 16, 2013~My mom is a coffee whore. Actually, she's just a starbucks whore. You think I'm kidding? The staff knows her drink and often makes sure that her drink is made right because otherwise they'll get the wrath from her. And trust me, it's happened plenty of times before. This location is convenient and super close to my house and all the shopping when I'm home. I love that they have drive-thru and the drinks made here are generally good and not sloppy. It's probably my favorite Sbucks to go to anywhere.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Jul 28, 2011~It's Starbucks.....you always know what to expect, quality of drinks the same. The baristas are nice &amp; attentive. This Starbucks stays busy!
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Oct 11, 2014~9 at night with a nice crowd on the patio. Drive thru was quick and the man behind the curtain was helpful and friendly. The only coffee they had was medium roast so I got a shot of espresso added to it. Coffee was fresh. Giving 3 stars to be neutral as I did not experience this Starbucks when crowded nor go inside.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Oct 11, 2009~Unfortunately, there is no other place around the area to get good coffee/espresso drinks.  Fortunately, there is Starbucks.  I love my caffeine, therefore I love Starbucks--- especially the one 2 minutes from my house.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Dec 10, 2015~Would be a great location if the service was a little faster I consistently have to wait 30 minutes in line before ordering
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~May 6, 2017~I don't write a lot of reviews. But I'm traveling north on I85 and need to grab coffee... quick. It took them 15 minutes to get me my venti coffeee. The guy Chris who started the preset literally left the cup on the counter and went on break while I waited.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Apr 21, 2011~Starbucks is what it is, one of the most widely known coffee venues, and while the staff is friendly and the coffee is good, the best part are the refills... gotta have caffiene! Been Gold since 2007 and will be for a long time to come!
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Oct 20, 2015~The Uganda Sippi Valley coffee was silky smooth, light, floral, and aromatic. My new fave. Customer service is great here. Stand alone store located in a busy shopping district.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Mar 19, 2017~Took over 30 minutes to make me a French press after I ordered.  They apologized and comped my purchase after it was finished.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 1, 2013~Come on....melted whip...melted frapp....you can do better than that.....and a dead pan glare from the drive thru guy when you question the icky glop on top of a $4.50 frapp....disappointed...
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Jul 12, 2017~Place was not clean. Floor needed cleaning , no cream for coffee, no napkins and not one smiling face behind counter. Coffee was good.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Feb 16, 2011~12 Feb 2011 at 3pm.  The guy working here needs more training or needs to be replaced.  He has messed up 3 orders since I been here.  It also takes 20 minutes to get your coffee. This place is making the customers angry.  My java chip was good but my wifes caramel macciato was bitter, as if no sugar was added. Probably won't come to this one again.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Nov 14, 2015~This location is one of the slower locations I've been to...be patient and prepared for a wait.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Mar 11, 2017~Every time I go to this location they are extremely slow. There are always 7 or more vehicles in the drive through waiting. Last 2 times I came here is was  more than a 20 minute wait in the drive through. Im not sure what people are ordering that should take so long to prepare. The bad thing about this location is you cannot escape the drive through if you needed to leave for any reason
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 27, 2017~I've never written a review before but this service was so terrible I needed to warn others. My husband and I go to Starbucks almost everyday and get the same drink. This location in Eastchase is hands down the WORST Starbucks I've ever visited. I've given them several opportunities but am let down every time. My two most recent experiences are the deal breakers. About a week ago we went and ordered a Venti caramel mocha frappuccino, my husbands typical drink, and the drink we were handed after a 30 minutes wait in the drive through was white. I told the cashier that this was not the correct drink and she immediately got and attitude and threw her hand out like `"what do you even mean`" and was angry she had to remake it. After this experience I gave them one more attempt and yet again long wait, TERRIBLE customer service, under-trained staff, and WRONG drinks again, and an attitude when asked for the corrected beverage. Never again. I've been to every other location in Montgomery and never had any issues. I will go MILES out of my way to go to another location before returning to this establishment.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Jan 20, 2016~Second time this week I've come with only 3 cars in the drive-through, and I've waited for more than 15 minutes. This location has slowly become much slower!!
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Jun 18, 2011~This is a nice Starbucks, with friendly service and lots of room to read, study or hang out with friends. Not the most convenient stores due to the street layout, and the parking lot/drive thru can seem challenging to negotiate. Otherwise, it's in a good location.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jun 7, 2014~If you make my coffee wrong and then claim that I don't know what I am talking about that us just crap. I won't be back.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 9, 2016~this starbucks has the slowest service of all the starbucks in Montgomery, and the most inconsistency in drinks... I always go with my girlfriend and we order the same coffee no special instructions (venti caramel ice coffee with cream and classic) and without fail they come out 2 totally different drinks its almost as if they want to see how different they can make the same drink look and never have they been able to duplicate my drink on a refill
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Dec 28, 2014~It seems the large customer service counter has been replaced by a Starbucks in this Target store. The customer service center is small now and not in the location you might expect in a target store.That being said, I would never complain about making room anywhere for a Starbucks counter. This Starbucks could use more training. Batista was not super helpful in guiding my mom to a drink she might enjoy. She was not happy with the drink, but I enjoyed mine. I'm a Starbucks regular, so I have my favs. Otherwise the store was fine.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Feb 18, 2018~Update your hours so that we do not walk into target and see that you are closed. It was Sunday 11:30 am. Would have been nice. We went across the street to a stand alone Starbucks.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Sep 5, 2016~I'm a Starbucks regular and honestly, do yourself a favor and drive over to the Starbucks at the front of Eastchase. The service at the Target location is just rude enough to make your latte taste bad.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Dec 23, 2018~Came in Sunday morning , 23 December 2018 to what I counted was 8 employees. Restaurant appearance from out side the front to the trash on the floor stepping in was HORRIBLE..You had conversations going on about everything, people standing around, like WTH! Yelp should have video, my words aren't doing the justice needed.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~May 14, 2015~So I never knew that they had happy hour for frappachino. The guy on the intercom let us know and was cool about it too. So both the wife and I got one. Love it that we can get drinks for cheaper then usual. Nice location and clean.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Apr 11, 2024~I ordered an iced lavender cream oat milk matcha drink and this is what I received. I asked the barista if this was the correct drink because of the lack of color and he assured me it was correct. It tasted like dirt water with a hint of coffee. I then went to the Starbucks at East Chase and received the correct drink.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Aug 29, 2024~This is the FRIENDLIEST Starbucks I have ever been in!  I PRAY THEY ARE PAID WELL!  Great customer service!  They were moving fast to get things done!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 7, 2024~by far one of the worst starbucks i've ever visited..... i asked for simply a carmel ribbon crunch no whip ex carmel ex crunch.... 1st attempt bottom of the cup full of whip... 2nd attempt no ex carmel no ex crunch and milk was sitting at the top of my cup 3rd attempt the worker was just being a a**h*** and filled the bottom of the cup with so much caramel i could even drink it threw the straw starbucks is not cheap so i want what i paid for but ill never go to that one again
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Jun 25, 2024~Robert is great for genuine hospitality, but all the staff are friendly, the food and drink are well executed, and the location is not bad at all. So why not 4-5 stars? The big downer at this location is the music! Bang!, bang!, bang! ...loud brain-shattering drums all day long! This is the worst location I've ever known for sound. It may be good for dancing, but it does not allow any peaceful thinking, reading, or talking. It's torture! They may do that for the workers (whom I've seen dancing while working) but that is not right: they should make it good for customers. I tend to flee to the terrace, which is less acoustically oppressive, but summers in Alabama are too hot for that. If they ever change this problem, I'll be happy to give it a better review.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Sep 4, 2023~This location isn't as consistent as we hoped. Our first visit a few years ago was great and every single visit since then has been trending down hill. Our order has been wrong a few times or completely forgotten. We've had to remind them about our drinks we had already paid for or they call your name for part of your order, then forget to announce the rest of your order.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Apr 22, 2024~Both morning crew and night crew don't seem to know how to make a drink correctly at all. The drink always tastes watered down or too milky. The baristas must not have trained well enough to know the correct pumps for each drink. Their customer service is not friendly and inviting. The baristas hold a unprofessional attitude even if this is just a coffee shop. The only things you can trust to order from this particular location is food and that's because they don't actually make it.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Dec 28, 2022~This was not the best experience at this location. Spent over 20 minutes stuck in drive-thru, waiting for service, and then when I did my drink was awful. The staff wasn't even apologetic about anything.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~May 31, 2024~service was good. coffees were made perfectly. Ll the staff members are very friendly
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Sep 23, 2023~They give you the complete opposite of what you order. Not returning to this location. Too many times I have had to reorder a simple drink order
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Apr 7, 2022~My mom and I stopped here on our drive down to FL and we had some of the best Starbucks drinks we've had in awhile. The baristas were super friendly (they even gave us pup cups for our two dogs!), and the inside of the Starbucks was super clean with plenty of seating.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Sep 4, 2021~It's great to have a Starbucks near me! The staff is friendly and they wear mask. Seating is limited inside, but you are allowed in. There's also outside seating as well. The building is brand new, so it has a modern interior like most new Starbucks. My negatives are the same as every Starbucks, every time I fall in love with a menu item it gets taken off or it's just seasonal. No snickerdoodle cookies, no everything bagel bites, no more peach teas .
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Jan 1, 2021~Service was straightforward and very nice. However they 1. Didnt have cold brew. 2. Iced Americano was very grainy and bitter.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Oct 19, 2021~Tooooo slow! Had only 1 register open during the morning rush. Really? Waited &amp; waited... customer had problem with a coupon... they never opened another register to help the customers who didn't have issues. Finally left empty handed &amp; disappointed. Not returning
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Dec 18, 2021~Great location. Worst service ever. Every. Time. Wrong orders. Missing items. Watery drinks. Staff walking away when you're mid sentence ordering. Close at random times. Unreliable. Claim to be short staffed but also turn away anyone who tries to apply or inquire about work.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Jul 23, 2021~Our 2 years old daughter is the biggest fan of their cake pops. We went to Zelda location today but they were out of cake pops. BF called East chase location then but they just sold out of them. So he called this location to make sure they have some cake pops, the guy he spoke to was the nicest. When we went to the drive through window, he greeted us so nicely and gave free cake pops to our daughter because we had to drive far! The best service and so friendly! Our daughter couldn't be happier!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Dec 29, 2022~I went there with 3 other people two ordered a hot chocolate and 2 ordered coffee and cake pops they told us they were out of cake pops and somehow they came up with the five we ordered they didn't have our drinks ready and we ordered 30 minutes ago they didn't put any I mean any Carmel or whipped cream in au of our drinks I do not recommend going to them on Wednesday during 12-3:00 cause service was horrible then she got an attitude with us when we ask for a refund
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~May 8, 2022~This particular Starbucks turns the `"order ahead`" feature off much too often.  In my humble opinion there should not be an option to turn it off.  Never experienced this until I moved to Montgomery.  Most employees do not have a sense of urgency, rather, you're presented with a `"I'll get to it when I can`" sort of demeanor.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Feb 15, 2021~So slow. I went at the most random time around 4:30 in the afternoon, sat in line for 30minutes. Food and drinks were good but that wait is insane.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Dec 29, 2020~Great staff and perfect experiences every time I visit! Thank you Chantilly Starbucks
Hope Hull, AL 36043~5~Apr 18, 2024~This is my absolute favorite Starbucks in Alabama. Always quick with great service in order is always on point. Great management at this store.
Hope Hull, AL 36043~3~Dec 4, 2024~Third time coming through here (in about a month) one to two hours before close and all the outside lights are off (each time I've gone). (Taco Bell isn't even open yet right next to it and their lights are on). Nothing except the safety lights are on. Each of these three times the cashier has handed me the scanner instead of taking my card expecting a tip, `"it's gonna ask you a question`". But they're turning the lights off (or not turning them on) making costumers who aren't local think they're not open. It's literally a safety concern not to mention a work ethic issue.The coffee always tastes good and the people are nice. It just burns me up with people try to pull one over on the costumers.
Hope Hull, AL 36043~5~Feb 20, 2024~The barista ladies at this Starbucks are fast and serving up delicious drinks. I picked up the best, creamiest, caramel ribbon crunch. So delicious! Clean location, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating if you plan to stay awhile.
Hope Hull, AL 36043~1~Sep 21, 2024~I food hair in my drink and the people are always rude. I went in this time and the bathroom was horrible.
Hope Hull, AL 36043~5~Jan 1, 2024~This is one of our traditional stops on our way to Florida. The staff is phenomenal. Everyone makes you feel welcome. The drinks and food are served efficiently. Always clean whether it's the bathrooms or the entire storefront. They great you with a smile and acknowledge you when you leave. All other Starbucks should take note!
Hope Hull, AL 36043~2~Jul 27, 2024~I have been ordering the same coffee product for 20 years. I have gotten it all over the country and it always tastes the same. Then last week I ordered that same drink for the 20th time at this location. What I got was completely unblended, watered down mess. I should have known something was wrong when it was sitting on the drive through window when I got there. There is no point in stopping at this place any longer if they cant fix a simple drink correctly. You can do better. I am not going to lower my standards for you.
Hope Hull, AL 36043~3~Dec 16, 2022~Be prepared to wait... in both the drive thru and in store.Employees working fast but not enough help.They got our order wrong but had no problem fixing it when we point it out to them.Parking lot is large and there is room on the back street to park when towing an RV.Beverages made correctly.
Hope Hull, AL 36043~5~Feb 9, 2024~Great service. Product as expected but. Clean, friendly staff..................good display of retail items
Hope Hull, AL 36043~1~Oct 1, 2023~So they have some sort ofCrap where they can't use their venti cups for the people in the lobby only for mobile orders . What kind of crap isThis. ? The most ridiculous Starbucks ever . Don't stop here . It's a waste of time . Second time stopping here and every time it's an issue .
Hope Hull, AL 36043~5~Nov 17, 2021~I am thanking for their staff for their support of me. I am grateful to their customers and my great coffee each morning. Thanks again for your support and for your polite manners. I can appreciate the hard work done at the Yonge and Holly Street. JP
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Sep 1, 2024~This location is dirty. I witnessed an employee empty the trash and hand half filled cups to an employee that was fixing drinks to discard the old trashed liquid in the clean reservoir. No gloves. I asked for a refund when the employee started to fix my drink without washing her hands after dealing with trash. She had an attitude and said whatever the manager has to do it. The manager, who also had an attitude, charged me for 2 more drinks instead of issuing a refund. When I confronted her about not giving me a refund but instead charging me again she said this register can not do refunds I have to do it on the other register. She knew that she had recharged me instead of giving a refund. I did get double refunded but only after the manger thought she could trick me.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~May 18, 2024~Most of the Starbucks I've been in reasonably have it together and work together to chuck out the beans but this one has an attitude problem. No one is talking, there's no working together, just angry people making mistakes because they don't want to be doing what they're doing. We paid for our drinks and waited over 15 minutes till we finally just walked out. We watched drinks being remade and angry little souls spouting they're about to walk out while making drinks. Management needs to step in and fix this one. There were alot of people in here overspending for coffee and everyone was waiting, maybe 25-30. Not good Starbucks, do you even know you have a problem??  Side note, the restroom was atrocious.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~May 29, 2023~The management team really needs to work on scheduling and efficiency. I've been here in the morning and the afternoon and there is always a really long wait. The weekday mornings after 8:30am are decent, but weekends, early mornings, and holiday afternoons and absolutely awful with wait times. I tend to go to the Starbucks downtown because of the wait time. That Starbucks has less people and are way more efficient with their time. Positive thing is the people they have working here lately are pleasant and polite.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~May 7, 2024~Horrible wait.  Waited and then they forgot my ice water.  I complained about the wait and the boy at the drive thru said for get the ice water.  I told him I was not leaving without it.  He said have a good day.  He was so rude.  He asked me for an apology but I asked if he was going to give one to me for the wait...nothing.  Tuesday5/7 1:30pm.  Cons Ford
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Jun 5, 2024~Absolutely appalling lack of customer service at this location. My order had been messed up today and I politely asked if they could remake my coffee (tasted like burnt chemicals) and the girl gave me a huge sarcastic attitude, rolled her eyes at me and proceeded to laugh in my face when I inquired about the rest of my order that was. Mind you, there was no one else in there and they were not busy so it's not like I was rushing them or bothering anyone (also not to mention it was ready until 45 minutes after I placed the order but not even worried about that part...)She told me someone else had came in and walked out with my order but refused to make me another or refund my money????I work in the same shopping center as this location, get coffee and breakfast almost every day I work (5-6 days a week), always leave a tip, and have never had any issues until today. I work in customer service as well so totally get being burnt out/having a bad day but no excuse for the attitude and total lack of professionalism from the employee(s) today. Do better.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Jun 19, 2020~When you've been to one Starbucks, you've been to them all. Well, except for maybe Seattle locations. But that's besides the point. We were traveling and it was happy hour. I searched for the nearest Starbucks along the route, and this one came up. We navigate here and had an easy time of locating, and it was pretty easy to get back on the interstate once we were done. I was worried about the line/wait time because of the special, but surprisingly, there wasn't one at all! Our drinks were out and accurate in no time and we were back on the road. Would stop here again if I'm in the area!
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Jan 16, 2021~Very convenient location. Right off I-65 and roughly half way between Destin, FL and Nashvile, TN. Like a lot that the store is dedicated to the people who serve our country. Appears to be cleaner that other Starbucks stores. It's hard to say why, but the worst choice is to walk to the store. Line wasn't long to order, but we had to wait for ever to get our coffee orders. The quality of the coffee is the same as everywhere - Starbucks standard.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Dec 24, 2022~Worst Starbucks I've ever been to. Always takes 30-45 min to get a drink. Ordering ahead is a joke. It seems like they are always understaffed.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Oct 19, 2023~It's exactly what you would expect going to the busiest Starbucks in the state of Alabama. It takes a long time to get through the line and get a drink it's not the fault of the staff the store is not Designed to handle the volume of customers it has
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Jan 4, 2023~Nothing special I personally haven't experienced a lot of what the other reviews are on about so I can't speak on that but I mean the drinks are Starbucks they can be good they can be bad. I've never ordered from online but every-time I order through drive thru the people were really nice and had a great attitude. I almost never get coffee though I always get the fruity drinks tbh.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Oct 2, 2022~worst Starbucks I've ever been to. I do mobile order and give them so much time to prepare the order. always an extra 10-20 mins, for something simple, like an iced tea! Who is managing this Starbucks?? they need to do better....and organize their team better. Ive never had a drink come out on time here. drive through is always backed up too.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Dec 31, 2022~Worst experience EVER at Starbucks.*Store was completely trashed!!! Like health department needs called trashed. *There was 9 people behind the counter, 1 or 2 who looked to be actually working.*Waited 20+ minutes for 1 drink*Foam was running all down the sides of my Venti cup*Only had dome lids with small straws!!!!*Worst coffee I have ever had!!!*Charged $.80 for drizzle. It was literally a dot!The employees were very unprofessional behaviorally and appearance.Not a good representation of what Starbucks is. Close this location before someone gets sick from the dirtiness. Clean it, retrain the staff and start over.Yuck!
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Dec 30, 2022~Waited almost an hour on a toasted white chocolate coffee my sandwich got cold and there weren't but only 5 people ahead of me. Longest time I've ever been in a Starbucks by far. definitely not satisfied.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Jul 9, 2022~Absolutely the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. I placed a mobile order for a cold brew and muffin. When I got there I didn't see my drink or muffin up yet. They let me wait (only person waiting at the pickup area) for 15 mins before calling my name just to say they don't have cold brew at 7:30am. What? They had been taking inside orders and making drinks while I had been standing there. I had to go back out to get my phone for my car for a refund. When I walked back in they wanted me to wait inline for a refund which was 10 plus people long. I stated I just needed a refund though. The employee called me out in front of everyone saying yes, please cut in front of everyone in line. I was so embarrassed when my order had been placed 20 mins ago at this point. I won't let anyone belittle me like that though. I kindly responded back please don't phrase it like that. You had me waiting 15 mins before calling my name to say you couldn't make my drink. I'll be sure to avoid this location when passing on vacation. Your employees are awful!
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Jul 25, 2021~How can you road trip without Starbucks? Stopping 2 hours into our 12 hour road trip here sounded like a good idea--it's almost right off the highway. We ordered our drinks at 1136 and didn't get them till 1204. There was a ton of people working but only a couple of them were doing anything. The longer we were there the more people accumulated. Starbucks shouldn't take 30 minutes to get drinks when you order inside. Especially when people in the drive through are getting drinks faster. I am VERY disappointed with this Starbucks. This town ate our time. Should have taken 5-10 minutes to get Starbucks...not a half hour. Only reason it gets 2 stars instead of one is my drink was at least made right ‍ my friends was not...given regular coffee instead of cold brew.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Mar 28, 2022~I do mobile order. My drink is always ready when I get there, which is nice, but then I still have  to stand there and wait to get a straw. Keeping the straws behind the counter is baffling. But, if you're going to be this protective of your straws, then train the staff the quickly acknowledge someone standing at the mobile order pick up with their drink on hand.  I realize employees are busy. I don't want to bother them, but if you're going to force me to ask for a straw, please don't look at me like I'm bothering you when I say `"excuse me`"  I don't want to stand there for 5 mins or more just to get a straw.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Mar 25, 2021~Ordered a grande cold brew without ice and got this. Asked if they could fill it up and they said they weren't allowed to fill it past a certain line. Literally the only Starbucks I've been to that was this stingy. If you have options, definitely don't go to this one.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Mar 18, 2023~We have stopped here several times over the last few years on our drive thru Alabama and this is without a doubt the the worst Starbucks you will ever encounter.  There are plenty of people working there so the issue must be with the managers.   It is soooo slow.    The last visit was so bad I am boycotting Starbucks for the next few months
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Sep 28, 2018~A Starbucks location in one location, is a virtual copy of a Starbucks in another location - with very little variation between locations. This location has easy access from the interstate. When our orders came, they were correct and although service was a little slower than expected, they were only slightly outside of the usual wait. During my visit to this location, I came across an issue that I felt uncomfortable with.  I'm not sure if this is a Prattville issue or a Starbucks issue, but here goes. When signing into the `"free`" wi-fi, the Starbucks - Prattville location wanted several pieces of personal information and I felt hesitant to provide it. I could not know how my personal information would be stored, or the chance that someone else would be able to access my info. It is now standard around the world for the user to sign into wi-fi, without having to provide any personal information.  I chose not to sign-in. I will definitely visit this location again when I am in the area. I love Starbucks and I love good coffee.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Nov 20, 2021~Absolutely the slowest morning at uncoordinated place in Prattville. 9 employees working only one that seems to know what is going on.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Nov 8, 2020~This places needs some help! Very very long wait times far exceeding anything I have seen before. It is not just a  one time fluke but every single time waiting time averages 15 mins for coffee to go(not drive through). Trashy entrance with trash can over flowing every single time! I wish there were over options but Starbucks has the market.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Sep 27, 2020~They are absolutely rude and the trash outside was overflowing on the ground not just one but two of their trash cans were disgusting and completely unsanitary. They had customers who happened to be black in the restaurant not wearing a mask but, as soon as we walked in the door they told us to put our masks on and wear it right. They never said a word to the other customers. They were disgusting in their approach and we absolutely will not be back. As a matter of fact this completely sealed the deal of us never buying Starbucks again! The snarky kids they hire treat us like garbage. It's disgusting and what's wrong with our world right now.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Aug 30, 2021~Long inefficient line.  Asked for a sausage breakfast sandwich only to be told they had run out of ALL breakfast sandwiches.  Ordered pumpkin bread....they were out of that too.  My iced Chai was 80% ice!  3 sips and it was done...never again!
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Jun 18, 2019~Terribly slow, and the cashier at the drive through was rude and snippy. The drinks felt rushed and let's be honest that's what Starbucks is about. I wouldn't put so much stock into the employees as I would the products, you don't have to like your job but represent the company not yourself.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Nov 14, 2021~This is the second time in the last month that I have waited over 40 minutes for an order. No one seems pressed to get orders filled. I wouldn't waste time going to this location! Especially if you are trying to get on the road to travel, or have any sort of plans in general. Also, doing a mobile order does not help!!
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Aug 7, 2022~Unbearably slow service. I noticed the line wrapped around the building for the drive thru (with no room around in case you change your mind fyi) so I went inside. There were four people in front of me and it took 15 minutes to even get to me. I ordered one grande vanilla bean frap. It took another 15 minutes to come out to me. The staff was cranking out the mobile orders but didn't seem to put any priority on people waiting in the store. A bit ridiculous to wait a half hour in store for one drink. Clearly this is an indication that this city needs another Starbucks location or the staff is under trained and unmotivated to manage a Sunday morning in this city. This is not the first time I've had very slow service here either. I went drive thru last time and again it was between 15-25 minutes for one drink. It just defeats the purpose of a store like Starbucks.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Jul 12, 2021~I ordered a latte @ 135 degrees....not only was it on the ticket, the cashier verbally announced `"Latte for Debbie is 135 degrees`"  I took a sip and immediately burnt my tongue! It was certainly not at the lower 135 degree temp. No excuse.....they were not at all busy!!
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Jun 18, 2021~It's a Starbucks! Coffee was good, the wait was fair and the staff was friendly and fully masked. It was also clean and well maintained.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Jan 29, 2018~I come to this Starbucks quite often because it is easy access from the interstate. My order is always right and I never have a problem with the service. The wait time varies on the time of day. I mainly go thru the drive thru. I noticed if go very early in the morning, I get my order within a minute. Other times it can be almost 10 minutes.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Dec 26, 2015~This Starbucks is pretty much like all of the other ones I have been to. It was super busy when we arrived .We opted to go in although they do have a drive thru. Service was fine. Our coffee was made right and it was super hot.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Nov 22, 2018~I go here all the time. They won't let you know if they don't have ingredients until after they finish the order.  It's extremely bad customer service. No comp drinks or offers to make up for it if they don't have the drink or are unable to fill the order properly, available and it was a mobile order.  I've waited on an order only to be told there was no coconut milk. Then I had to wait on a clearly unwanted replacement.  No use to try to explain that they need to put in the system the supplies are no longer available or products. They apologize and that's the best you will get. Lol  There have been many good experiences over several years though.  There should be 10 stars as a review to be fair.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Dec 27, 2021~Would give it zero starts. They could care less about service. They prefer socializing and gooding off over working. Another customer asked how much longer her drink would take, the guy said it is about a 20-25 minute wait for drinks. Last time I checked Starbucks was not a restaurant nor should it ever talk that long with 6 people working. It is your job to make drinks and food quickly not to laugh and goof off with customers. The drive through does not need 2-3 people making drinks and 1 person making online and in person drinks. Worst service I have ever had and witnessed. Go else where if you actually want something made in a reasonable time. Shameful that they are not being held to the standards of other Starbucks. I was there a 1 in the afternoon and left after 1:30.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Oct 19, 2017~Was a hot mess. In their defense packed with tourists grabbing orders or taking wrong orders creating mayhem. The baristas did a good job trying to restore some flow to process but I'd skip this one if you see drive-thru line wrapping around bldg. Ordered online and only had iced coffee so got thru within 5 mins and I was in minority of those waiting.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Sep 5, 2021~Awful drinks and customer service. Do not go here a waste of time and money. Had to wait beyond the estimated time for a mobile order, which okay I get it sometimes a place gets busy. But the Lattes were disgusting and not made right. I couldn't even drink it. What a waste. Called to get a refund but was told no by two extremely rude employees  who wouldn't provide their names.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Apr 19, 2019~Understaffed but the staff that is there works hard and hustles. Should be a violation to understaff a Starbucks.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Jun 21, 2017~So this is a decent Starbucks.  They have basically a similar selection of items compared to other Starbucks.  This one also has a drive through although the signage from the outside is hard to spot.  I decided to go inside figuring that would be a bit quicker.  This place obviously is pretty busy in the morning as its right of Rt. 82 just before the interstate.  Service was quick and the staff was nice.  I generally come in and get coffee anyways versus ordering complicated drinks especially so early in the morning.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Jul 23, 2018~Uh, I think I will continue making my own coffee at home. I had two negative experiences at Starbucks and that was enough for me. Not only were my frappe latte's mediocre but overpriced as well. The staff and the work station were chaotic bumping into one another and even knocked over a cup or two in the chaos. To top it off during my second and final visit, when I received my frappe latte the barista had written 'BARBIE' where my name should have been written. Instead of making a fuss, I left my order on the counter and never went back.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Mar 22, 2014~Nice Starbucks.  Friendly staff, clean floors, spacious.  Fair amount of plugs for connected work/leisure.Not overrun with Swag, which is nice.Nice patio seating.Not earth-shatteringly cool.  Just nice.Did I say it's `"nice`"?Starbucks: When you think you need a cup of Pavlovian comfort at a gourmet price.Oh Snap!  Noticed the standard legacy pendulum lamps aren't over the pickup area.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Oct 8, 2021~Customer service is out the window! I've never been spoken to so rudely! I thought I would give them another chance and I was still disappointed by there customer service. The manager of all people was the one to snap at me. I was just trying to order my drink and he was acting like I should know everything about Starbucks like I work there or something. So disappointed. Starbucks back in Florida are way better. They knew how to not snap at there customers!!!!!
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Apr 1, 2021~The employees were very rude. Do they even care about customer service. This is not what I expect from a Starbucks. I think I'm going to delete the app because of this.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Nov 21, 2018~I wish I could give zero starsWaited 30 min They lost my order No apologies No comped drinks It may be time to boycott Starbucks The service gets worse and worse every day
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Sep 14, 2019~First time visiting this Starbucks. I was just passing thru. I did mobile order and went through the drive up. The guy working was so nice and even called me ma'am. Me= shook. My drink was amazing. Blended perfectly. I'm pretty picky when it comes to my $7 drink and they exceeded my expectations! I wish every Starbucks was this good at making fraps!
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Jul 23, 2016~This is by far one of the most poorly managed Starbucks I've ever been to in the entire country. Perhaps it's because I'm from Seattle and I take my coffee seriously but every time I try and come to this Starbucks, the drive-thru line is absolutely insane and it can take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to get a single iced coffee if you go inside. The employees seem to lack efficiency. Just last weekend my husband and I attempted to get a coffee before we traveled to Birmingham but the line inside and out was so long and so slow-moving that we just decided to drive to Birmingham and get our Starbucks there. Another example, I'm sitting in the drive-thru line right now. It's a Saturday afternoon around 4:00pm, I've been sitting in the drive-thru line for over 20 minutes just to get a single drink! I never have these problems at any other Starbucks, except this one in Prattville!
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Dec 29, 2019~If you're in a hurry DONT GO HERE. Drive through takes twenty plus minutes.....and I'm still waiting! I can't even back out because the roads so narrow. I worked food service before so I understand how long quality food can take to make but this is beyond ridiculous for just a couple of lattes
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Dec 21, 2019~Was one of the worst Starbucks I've been too! Ordered to drinks an they were completely messed up . They `" remade them twice an still gave us the wrong drinks . The manger was very rude when I called complain about it . I wouldn't recommend going there . Also the bathroom is very dirty an trash spilling out of trash can inside
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Apr 5, 2021~I already felt indifferent about going to this location due to lack of consistency, but after this morning I will not be back. The person working the window was very rude and my drinks were made incorrectly. Its not worth it
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Oct 8, 2016~25 mins to order, another half hour to get a freaking cup of coffee...  ludicrous.  16 cups at the bar with zero takers, girls backed up, I think people are leaving and saying screw it.. I was really close.  the manager here needs to get with it because they are loosing business.   this will be the last cup I ever get here.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Mar 17, 2018~Please don't go through the drive through if you're in a hurry. This is consistently an extremely slow line.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Dec 30, 2016~Used the Starbucks app to place our order to stay in the growing line. I guess they do the app orders last as many have come and gone and we are still waiting for our drinks! Several people walked in during our wait and got served and left before us...Poor treatment, we ended up waiting 20 mins for our drinks.
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Dec 25, 2018~All right, I get it that at times they may mess your order up or they don't get it to you quick as you would like.  This is the busiest Starbucks in Alabama. All of the slushbirds from up north pass through here to go to the beach. Busy. There are not many choices on 65 between here and the beach.  Of course, this makes for pandemonium at times. In spite of that, you get your coffee or latte or frap.  These guys pull it off.  Maybe not as smooth as you would like, but they work it well.  This is what I love about living in a relatively free country.  You can protest your feelings and you can choose not to visit a business. I will visit the store and often.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Nov 10, 2015~I've been to Starbucks in just about every state in the US and several in Germany and the Middle East. Sometimes they can be slow, but I haven't seen them any slower than any other Starbucks. Great staff that really try hard; in spite of some of the jerks that come in (like some of the negative reviews here).  Yes they tend to be drive-through centric, but so are all i've been to. It would help, if you knew what the hell you wanted before you got to the register. BTW, they should not take multiple orders from anyone unless it is called in.  That slows everyone down. Still a very good Starbucks in spite of the negative nellies.
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Aug 15, 2015~The go-to coffee place in Prattville.  They're fast, friendly, and convenient to the freeway.  It's hard to drive by it and not want to stop in for something tasty.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Dec 13, 2017~Made a pit stop on a trip home and ordered a venti of the Christmas blend. I went to go put sugar in it and they were out of sugar. Asked the barista for more and she informed me they only had Splenda. WHY would you wait until after I paid to tell me you don't have sugar, a key ingredient in most coffees. They didn't seem to even care. Also, don't use the restroom there because the lock is broken on the door.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Feb 21, 2016~Not very efficient at filling orders. Even though there were 6 employees working when I visited, it still took about 8-9 minutes before my drink was made. The drink was good. It seems to be a training issue. 2 of the employees were joking/giggling and not totally concentrated on filling orders. I'm all for fun at work but let's keep our eye on the business at hand. Cups were all over the place, it seemed as if the employees were not familiar with the process.  I probably just came thru at a bad time the last 3 times I've been here. I'm sure they have faster turnaround times  Overall, not a bad place to visit, as long as your not in a rush. Plenty of seating, outlets and outdoor tables also. Wifi was spotty all three times I visited.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Jul 14, 2018~Horribly slow service. Yes the drink was good, yes, the store was busy, but I place a mobile order 10 minutes out (only one drink). It even asked me if I wanted to order yet because the drink would only take 4-7 minutes.  25 minutes after I arrived in the store I received my drink.   Most people who were not there had been waiting 20-30 minutes.    Again, busy, yes, but not THAT busy.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Aug 23, 2019~This location has wonderful people working but, the PARKING- YUCK! Best to go thru the Drive-thru. You will be happier.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~May 31, 2020~Stay away! This starbucks funnels you around the back of a very long building and once you are in the 25minute line, there is no escape. After reading other poor reviews, i thought i'll stick with pikes...how can you screw coffee up? Cold and burned. My daughter cannot drink milk and selected an almond latte. She received a regular milk latte. If you like Starbucks, move to the next one. If you like coffee, find a different source. Starbucks should be ashamed of themselves for allowing a franchise like this to stay in business.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Jan 26, 2020~Took way too long to get my order. Ended up getting the wrong order and having to wait even more. Overall, not my favorite Starbucks. Barristas do not speak the order loud enough for anybody to hear.
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Jul 19, 2017~Just had the most pleasant interaction with Hugh in the drive thru. Will be stopping by this Starbucks for a pick me up on the way back from the beach as well!
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Aug 27, 2016~In a nutshell, I stopped going to this Starbucks (coffee addict!) because of the slow and horrible service. I gave them 3 opportunities...first time, I thought it was just a simple mistake, ordered two items and they just forgot to give me the 2nd one, and the barista knew I was waiting for something (place wasn't packed), second and third time basically the same. The beverages were poorly prepared and the service is poorly executed, both in store and drive thru...
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Nov 22, 2018~Every time I've placed a mobile order for this location it either takes me 15+ minutes to get it or they loose my order. I don't understand why this location has such a hard time getting drinks out in a reasonable amount of time
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Jul 28, 2017~Stopped here for a caffeine pit stop and got the Venti, White Chocolate Mocha with Almond Milk.  Very tasty!  I'm lactose intolerant, so this was nice and easy on my stomach.  The cashier was super nice and I double checked my order to make sure they put Almond milk and not regular.  The guy ran over to Barista and came back to give me the thumbs up!  Definitely will be returning .  Also, prices great!  Venti was under six dollars.  Less than what I'm use to!  Yay!
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Jun 2, 2016~Quality and speed have both improved. I would say this location is now squarely average.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Oct 16, 2015~Slow. Slow. Slow. Can't even tell you how many people just give up on getting a cup of coffee every morning because of how slow this place runs. Off hand I'd estimate 10+ minutes average in line at drive through.And the only reason to go to Starbucks - quality control, is not there either.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~May 9, 2017~I'm not sure why I am even bothering with this review....Star Bucks is too big of a chain and they make LOTS of money off of people like me even when I'm complaining, so why would they make any adjustments to the way they do business when bad customer service and `"okay`" tasting coffee makes them millions. Nonetheless I rated this place as 2-star because it doesn't matter what time of the day or what day of the week it is, you will still wait....and wait...and wait for your coffee. So if you have a lot of free time, then this is the place for you. Their outdoor seating is horribly placed in the parking lot right by the drive through. So if you like the smell of car exhaust, and oil stained asphalt then take a seat. But I guess if they didn't have an outdoor seating option someone would complain about that...so be grateful for what you have right?  The seating on the inside is better than some, but WAY to over crowded with little round tables. There's a nice seating area directly to your left when you walk in (couches, chairs tables) and then directly to your right is about 9-12 two seater round tables crammed next to each other. Not sure they thought that through. The best seat in the house is at the long high table in the middle of the store. That is if you don't mind bumping shoulders with the man bun backpack wearing dude who is there ALL THE TIME. Would recommend getting your coffee to go. Enjoy!
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Nov 7, 2016~This Starbucks seems to be like every other I have been to which is quite a few. On occasion, the drive thru line is outrageous but it's no worse than a Chick Fil A during its busiest hours. I work in Prattville so I visit frequently and have never had a problem concerning service. Everyone is very kind and seem to try and do their best. I am shocked that the other reviews are so horrible...
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Feb 28, 2018~It wasn't that busy but it took awhile to get my drink.  I wanted to redeem my rewards but the cashier got the information wrong.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Dec 30, 2015~One of those cases of `"C'mon, it's a Starbucks, what is there to say?`"  But I do like the physical space with high ceilings.  The interior totally masked by the strip mall exterior (is this a new design thing for Starbucks?  If so, then great).  Sunday morning in Prattville so LOTS of churchin' folk.  But also some hipsters!  Wow.  In Prattville?!  I have added it to my I-65 Southbound rest stop list ;)
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Sep 26, 2015~This is the slowest Starbucks I've ever seen, and I've been to Starbucks in pretty much every state. On several occasions I've had to leave the drive thru after sitting more than 20 minutes and still not being able to order.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Oct 8, 2016~Had to wait a little bit to order which was understandable since they were busy. But after twenty minutes and I still didn't have my drink I said something to the cashier, told her my name, and she told them the wrong name. Five minutes after that they're still making other people's drinks that came in after me and I asked for my money back. One girl went `"I got it`" and made a grande when I had ordered and paid for a vinte with an extra shot of expresso. This is by far the worst Starbucks I have ever been to. Just save your time and go to either the Eastchase or Target locations.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Mar 7, 2018~i'm upset. i got an iced almond milk latte and it tasted like coal, which is upsetting considering i love both starbucks and iced almond milk lattes. 10/10 will not return. partially because i don't live here.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Aug 12, 2015~Even though there is a Starbucks down the street inside the Target, I prefer coming to this one because the staff is more knowledgeable of the menu, are quicker, and the best, the drive through! Friendly staff here and they always spell my name right too lol. Free Wifi here so basically everything that every other Starbucks has.
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Nov 24, 2018~Very friendly service!! And ALWAYS fully stocked with ingredients needed to serve customers!!
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Jun 4, 2015~When it's actually open and has what you order in stock, it's good. Far too often, though, they aren't open as late as their posted hours and are out of basic coffee menu items. Not sure if it's a staff, management, or franchisee issue, but this is the most unreliable Starbucks location I've been to.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Sep 10, 2015~Don't bother going inside, they only care about the damn drive-through (bunch of rude.....)
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Jan 22, 2016~I just went thru the drive thru on my break and the guy I didn't catch his name but he had a beard and tattoos and he was so nice and very helpful. I'm not in a very good mood today but he cheered me up right away. Great service and fast.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Aug 26, 2017~Worst experience I have ever had at a Starbucks. Incredibly rude service. The girl who took my order barely said a word and gave me the death stare for wanting my receipt printed. They didn't even call my name when my drink was ready. I finally looked over and just saw it sitting there. I asked if it was mine and no one even looked back at me or answered. Thank goodness it was mine because I just had to pick it up and hope it had my name on it.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Jan 1, 2016~Worst service ever!  Took 10 minutes for a vanilla latte (not counting the 10 wait in line).  Silly woman behind the espresso machine was doing nothing but laughing, joking, and distracting her coworkers.  10 drinks were waiting to be made, but only one machine was in operation.  Avoid this Starbucks if you are looking for a quick pick me up off the interstate.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Sep 19, 2016~Terrible service...rude! Dedicate 90% of their effort to the drive through, at the expense of those ordering inside.  I ordered a drink...20 minutes later inquired about the whereabouts of said drink and was told they didn't know where it was but would check. Went back 5 minutes later, same unprofessional blonde male employee said, `"nope, couldn't find it.`" Never made eye contact with me and just went about his business.  I kept my cool and another employee made my drink.  Sucks that they are the only one in town. Avoid it if possible.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~May 5, 2014~Worlds slowest moving drive thru!! The last 3 times I've come to the drive thru I have had to wait a MINIMUM of 10 minutes. There were only 2 or 3 cars in front of me each time! This is ridiculous.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Sep 5, 2015~This Starbucks is okay. Seems like they are always busy with the normal coffee house crowd so their isn't anywhere to sit and enjoy your coffee. I've had a few encounters with rude baristas. One barista in particular  has a lot of facial hair... Which kinda freaks me out. No hair net or anything.
Target~1~Feb 17, 2024~I mobile ordered my drink at 10:38AM. I was closer than 15 minutes away so I expected to wait a few minutes for my order what I didn't expect is to wait for over 30 minutes for my drink. The Starbucks wasn't even busy. When I asked the barista if she has seen a drink order for Holly (almost 30 minutes later; I thought someone might have grabbed my drink on accident). I told her how long I've been waiting she asked to see my order on my phone; and, she was just overall rude. Then she looked for it and someone else was making my order. I understand that this location has a drive through but they shouldn't be 30 minutes behind on mobile orders when the Starbucks wasn't even busy. I'm a frequent customer of Starbucks and my mobile order is never ready within 15 minutes like it is supposed to be at this location (I'm a local of this town that this Starbucks is in). This is the only Starbucks location I've ever been to that takes this long to make one drink.
Target~1~Dec 26, 2021~The worst  run  starbucks ever, after 40 minutes  waiting  i finally  asked for money  back and others followed and asked for their money-back. Its not like  they were busy , ten minutes or more calling  a customers name to get drink .
Target~4~Nov 26, 2017~So, full disclosure, I don't drink coffee, ever! That being said this is probably the third Starbucks I've ever been in. This is a small location that is located in the local Target so not quite the same experience as I've seen/had at an actual Starbucks location. However, it compares to all the other ones that are inside other Target locations. So, since I don't drink coffee, I tried the Caramel Apple Spice. Simply put this is amazing...made with:Steamed, freshly pressed apple juice and cinnamon syrup. Topped with sweetened whipped cream and caramel drizzle.So I'm kind of torn because I have never craved Starbucks, until now. This is actually a drink I would go out of my way to stop and grab on a cool morning looking for something to warm up. Staff here was friendly and had a few customers since it was Black Friday morning. They were as quick as possible to get people in and out. Should add that they had all of the normal coffee and cold drink options you would expect to find at Starbucks to go along with the pastries they typically offer.Give them a try, especially if you are already inside Target.
Target~1~Jun 25, 2016~I have to agree with the rest of the reviews, this place is pretty bad.  I came to target to go shopping and decided to get a drink from Starbucks.  I always get a white chocolate mocha frap, but I noticed it wasn't on the menu under the frap flavors.  I ordered it anyway since they had `"white chocolate mocha`" as a flavor for something else on the menu.  I got my drink and started walking around target.  I took several sips and had to take it back, it was so gross and melted quickly.  I don't know what they put in it but it tasted like caramel.  Not just caramel, but old, nasty caramel.   Yuck.
Target~5~Dec 27, 2021~Very good coffee! Only one worker and many people there yet I still got my coffee within 10 minutes!
Target~5~Dec 29, 2019~Great coffee fast. Despite having the same amount of people ahead of me this location always serves faster even with one employee. They always have a better stock as well and are very friendly. My go to place for coffee in town from here on out!
Target~1~Mar 13, 2020~We waited for about a minute at the front counter and then the lady came from the side and said I am helping a customer over here, I'm sorry. Then she disappeared into the back again. We waited about 5 minutes. We were like `"hello?! Anyone there??`" And there was no answer. So we waited a couple more seconds then left. When we left we saw she was sitting at a table with a few other girls talking. We were there at 12:00 pm on 03/13/2020
Target~2~Jul 19, 2020~There was 1 customer in front of me who waited about 10 minutes AFTER I got there so there is no telling how long she was waiting before I got there. The 2 baristas were just walking to the back and back up front over and over just gossiping about who knows what. They never once looked my way to acknowledge me or apologize for the wait. Finally, after about 20 minutes total of waiting, one girl took my order and it literally took her only about 1 minute to make my drink that I waited so long to even order. I am 9 months pregnant which is not hard to tell and literally can barely stand up at this point and not one time was I told sorry for having to wait there for so long. Not to mention I had frozen foods from grocery shopping at target. I highly recommend going to the starbucks less than a mile up the road, NOT in target!
Target~1~Feb 4, 2014~HORRIBLE! As a frequent starbucks customer, I know my espresso. I've been to locations all across the United States and this is THE WORST. Ever. Just plain bad. more expensive than any other starbucks.. I ordered a venti iced Carmel macchiato but I got a weak Carmel flavored milk instead... wtf? Oh, and I couldn't get a trenta either.. since when is that only for tea? My husband ordered a Carmel frap and I wish I could tell you what the girl did wrong but it tasted so bad I spit it out. I'm telling you this girl needs to be trained on what a barista DOES or she needs to be FIRED. Oh and I don't even want to get started on my customer service experience... I almost feel as if she made our drinks this bad on purpose... how do you screw up this bad? Just stay away from this place... I paid 5 bucks for a cup of milk... and all I wanted was a little espresso..
Target~5~Oct 24, 2017~They were very polite and were  helpful and shit.I want to buy all kinds of cool shit in there
Target~1~Nov 24, 2018~Terrible attitudes of the employees and y'all need to have a sign of items that are unavailable instead of having someone standing in line for 30+minutes and then find out as you start to place your order.. Yesterday was my FINAL time going to this Starbucks!!
Target~5~Aug 2, 2011~This is my `"home`" Starbucks. It's the only Starbucks in the Millbrook/Prattville areas and resides inside the Target Store. I love EVERY barista there. The baristas know my name, drinks &amp; schedule. It can get super busy, so be prepared to wait at times and give the baristas a break for goodness sake! The service is great &amp; they meet the quality you would expect from Starbucks.
Target~1~Nov 16, 2012~Okay- so as the poster said above, it gets busy, sometimes a 20 minute wait-- and again it's not the baristas fault, I have witnessed people being horribly rude to some of the girls behind the counter-- it's not there fault! ugh But I also witnessed a customer speaking with management on a Saturday morning when the line was at least 10 people deep with only one staff member behind the counter and the manager didn't have a good response :( hire more staff!! Thanks from a loyal Starbucks lover!
Target~1~Mar 2, 2013~This `"Starbucks`" is a joke. Typically one barista working which causes the line to back up. Pastry case is sometimes empty. They ran out of two sizes of hot coffee lids on a Saturday, and they weren't restocked until Monday afternoon. Management does not seem to care. The baristas are for the most part friendly, but the bottom line is that this is a poorly managed location, and Prattville desperately needs a freestanding location with a drive-thru.
Target~1~Jan 25, 2014~The people are very nice and apologetic but unless I go at 6AM the line is long, they are usually out if most food and this time they completely messed up my order.  Ordered 2 Grande White Chocolate Mochas and got 1 Grande and 1 tall black horrible coffees.  Also ordered 2 bagels with cream cheese and got them plain even after paying extra a.  Took so long and the line was massive so I just left and I won't be back.  Java House is much better and they even remember me and my orders when I come in.  Hire more people and train them, that's what you do in business or you lose awesome people.  Sad day when we were all excited to finally get a Starbucks!  The one in Target is better tho...
Target~1~May 25, 2016~This is the worst starbucks location I've ever visited, the baristas aren't really baristas. They are always out of stock of something.  The drinks never taste right and the staff is rude.  I'll go to the real Starbucks down the road and bring it into target with me.  At least they get it right aren't rude.
Target~1~Dec 10, 2014~After sending back my drink three times I left with the wrong drink rather than wait in line again and try to get it fixed.  Barista had no idea what she was doing.
Target~4~Mar 10, 2015~Stopped in for a couple of Latte's, a blueberry muffin and a veggie sandwich.  The muffin was tasty, my husband didn't care for the veggie sandwich, but the Latte's hit the spot.
Target~2~Sep 5, 2015~Not my favorite Starbucks. Usually tastes different than a `"real`" Starbucks. Out of stock a lot. Most baristas are cashiers. Do they get training!?
Target~1~Nov 21, 2012~I just ordered a tall cappuccino and, once again, Starbucks failed to deliver.  I have been to hundreds of Starbucks across the U.S. and it always amazes me how inconsistent the cappuccinos are.  A cappuccino should be made with equal amounts of milk and espresso.  At this particular location the barista poured the espresso into the cup and then filled the rest of the cup with milk - very little froth.  Imagine what happens to the flavor of the espresso once you dilute it with nearly 2 cups of milk.  It tastes like warm milk with a subtle coffee flavor (if you close your eyes and concentrate).  What the barista unintentionally made was a latte.  Why does the King of Coffeehouses not train  the baristas in making these?  I'm not just picking on this one location, it happens as often as not.  Please, Starbucks, I really WANT to continue this relationship.  You have long served as my beacon of light on early work mornings and late night travels.    Please develop a training program that will guarantee consistence so I am not left with my disappointment as I face the remaining of my long, tiresome, late Thanksgiving trip.
Fred Meyer~1~Aug 10, 2021~This is one of two Starbucks locations in town. This one is located inside Fred Meyer, and the other is located inside Safeway. Takes a few minutes to get you drinks here because the same barista making the drinks is also the one taking and cashing out orders.My experience here would've been a decent one if it wasn't for their faulty cups. I always hold my cups the same way as I'm getting into the car but for some reason this particular cup and/or lid was faulty. The lid popped off as the cup was hovering over my lap and spilled hot coffee all over my shorts, seat and vehicle. Luckily I got out of the car immediately and didn't get burned. It was inconvenient having to go back in to get a big stack of napkins to attempt to dry off my clothes and car enough so that it wouldn't be dripping wet.
Fred Meyer~5~Jul 20, 2023~I have been here everyday for about 2 weeks, and it is the best Starbucks I have been too! Lee is a absolutely amazing barista, and my experience is even better when he is working!!
Fred Meyer~4~Feb 1, 2019~I feel that this one has more of a bakery selection than the Safeway location (hence why I came here when the pumpkin scones came out). Even with a complicated order, they were still able to get it right. Way to go Starbucks. (One other thing I noticed was even the price difference between this and the Safeway location - amazing!)
Fred Meyer~1~Jun 25, 2017~This Starbucks is located inside Fred Meyer. Service is hit it miss. Yesterday I got a coffee drink and requested, and paid for, soy milk. Caleb took my order and made the drink. I noticed when I came around the side of the counter that he was steaming milk from a pitcher marked dairy. I asked him if he was using soy and he assured me he was. I got my drink and left. To make a long story short, it wasn't soy and I ended up throwing it out as I am allergic (not lactose intolerant) to milk. I didn't have time to run back to Starbucks. I'm really disappointed and this was the last thing I needed on an already lousy day. I won't go back. Ever. Wish I could give zero stars.
Fred Meyer~3~Jun 11, 2015~This Starbucks location is inside Fred Meyers, small, at the front, near the fresh produce section.  Tipping is not permitted, which I support.  A 16 oz cup of coffee will cost around USD 2.2
Safeway~5~Mar 20, 2023~There drinks Are amazingly delicious. There service is great they don't make you wait to long. I flat out love that place.
Safeway~3~Feb 11, 2018~Love that there is at least a Starbucks in Juneau (among less familiar places), however the prices do reject that this is indeed a Starbucks in Juneau. One time, I had ordered a cranberry bliss bar and it looked big and delicious from the display window. The barista cut it in half and put a square piece no bigger than a mouse-sized piece of cheese. Could be saved $3 by getting a donut from the grocery store bakery instead.Also, every year I get the molten chocolate frappucino the week before Valentine's Day, and was told that they no longer offer it not could make a decent substitute for it this year. Thank you
Safeway~5~Nov 13, 2017~Carry out weekly and is consistently amazing. Their pizza is great and if you haven't tried the chicken you're missing the best this side of the river! Service has always been a '5'. Keep it up guys and gals!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Aug 1, 2024~very weird starbucks. it's very modern &amp; clean but the wifi doesn't work, there aren't any outlets (they have 2 fake outlets), &amp; i couldnt actually tell i was walking into the right place at first because there isn't anything saying where the business's ' door is.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Dec 9, 2024~The location was good and inside has a pleasant interior setting. The vibe was pretty cool. They have nice customer service. The coffee was really delicious. Ordered a latte yesterday but it was not hot. The staff was friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Nov 15, 2023~Holiday cup season has begun!  Convienent location just off I 17. Lines move fast and orders are accurate. Drive through window is also pretty quick if that is your approach.  I only ever get coffee drinks, so I can't comment on the food preparedness.It's Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Aug 17, 2024~Really never super busy and it's easy access to the I 17. Definitely interesting near the highway though with a pretty transient population close by. Not sure what they could do about it but it is a little unnerving at times.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Jul 17, 2023~Convienent location just a block to I 17. Lines usually move pretty quick and orders are usually accurate. Drive through window is also pretty quick but that depends on the day. Not one of  our favorite locations mostly because we've had a couple of cold breakfast sandwiches and they have been out of things we wanted to order.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jul 31, 2024~It's always this store that i go to that ALWAYS gets the drinks I order made WRONG or disgusting! Like it's insane and exhausting along w a waste of gas having to go out of my way to another store to have it fixed.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Aug 19, 2022~I love this Starbucks. I was scared when was open so close to my house that I was going to go a lot but hasn't been too bad  I did pick up a habit of going on lunch break from work though. This staff is super friendly and efficient. It's a grab and go only Starbucks but judging by the area of bell road that makes sense. I don't like sweet so I've been getting a latte with oat milk and it hits the spot every time! I've gone to many Starbucks over the years and I love this location. Never had any issues. Foods always good, service is pretty fast and most importantly the drinks a superb.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jan 5, 2019~It's a hit or miss with Starbucks lately, but this one was great. No complaints. Quick and efficient. As usual, Starbucks is overpriced for what ya get. The staff was friendly and got my drinks made quickly. I got iced coffee as usual, but it was made properly unlike most locations. Thanks!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Nov 10, 2023~I think if I'm supporting an establishment to the tune of more than $6 for a cup of coffee, they should have at least one of their 2 restrooms available to the public! I do not feel it's fair to support an establishment that does not provide basic services!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Nov 27, 2023~Location very busy, employees are nice but manager was nasty to guests and did not seem helpful
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Apr 18, 2023~One of the worst Starbucks in the world.  There's no indoor seating and no condiments out where you can use them, and when I asked about condiments, I got a surly response. It's like it's June of 2020 in there. Tables and chairs are all piled along the wall, so there's no where to sit while you wait. The drive through might be just fine, though there was an awful long line. Just don't think you're going to `"go to Starbucks`" at this place.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Mar 16, 2023~The music's blasting so loudly that even if they had seating you wouldn't want to. Ridiculously run by the Starbucks `"kids`". The positive was the drink was made properly, but as usual you must ask for everything else. Stir sticks, cream, etc...Also the prices here are higher by at least .40 ct. (near I-17).
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Aug 11, 2023~I can't recommend this Starbucks.  It's 100 degrees outside and I pay $7 for an iced coffee and their seating area is closed.  I ask why and they say `"the area`" and I ask for clarification and they say `"our location`".  Which seems like a fairly average location.  It shares a building with a Chipotle, is next door to a Waffle House, a barbecue restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, 3 hotels, a barber shop, a donut shop, and a credit union.  Across the street are car dealerships and it's at a large freeway off-ramp.  So OK, I can't sit walk over from my hotel and enjoy my coffee - like I can in nearly every other Starbucks in existence.  If this place is so bad - how does Chipotle in the same building work?  But if you're not going to let people use your space - close it down.  I would have gone to the donut shop next door and got coffee if I had known you were going to be anti-customer at this Starbucks location.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Sep 20, 2019~My drink tasted different then other places. Also they forgot my caramel drizzle, maybe that's why. Maybe they were busy and forgot about it but still. He asked if we need a drink carrier &amp; I said no but he still gave us one. There's a drive thru at this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~May 12, 2022~Ridiculous rude person on the order today. We go here several times a day. I let the person know we had a mobile order. She didn't here the name so I said it again, she didn't hear it and asked a 3rd time so I raised my voice again thinking it must be the other engines and she told me I didn't need to yell it. I didn't even know what to say to that I was so taken Off guard and she went on being snarky to me when I'll we wanted was to just pick up our order like on every other time we were there. We literally won't be back. Her rude mocking was just way unprofessional.There was a nice person handing out drinks that was trying to say sorry for her and that was kind. My opinion is if you are going to jump at people maybe the service industry isn't for you.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Sep 30, 2023~No indoor services past 1:00PM. If you walk here from a car dealership just be aware it's drive thru only.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Apr 19, 2019~Newer Starbucks right off the I-17 and bell! Modern interiors and next to a Chipotle if your hungry too!I did a drive thru on this visit- Johnathan was amazing! He was so refreshing, had a smile on his face and asked what I was up to this weekend? When has anyone ever asked what I was up to (unless I was at Dutch Bros.)- he was a friendly picker upper for my day and I appreciated the light of joy he brought in the quick 5 mins it took to get my drink! Green Tea Frappe was perfect for today- it's hot!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Nov 10, 2020~Huge cafe and well made near to I-17. The staff was nice too. Drinks are obviously like all Starbucks. I rarely give 5-star to this chain since I prefer local coffee chains more but for the size and the courtesy of the staff, I would give it easily to this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 8, 2023~I absolutely cannot stand this place. First time I went for a Medicine Ball as I do when it's cold out and it was as if they just gave me hot water, no flavor and no tea bags were even in the cup. I was disappointed and said to myself maybe it was an off day. Today (2/8/23) I went in for a vanilla cream cold brew w/ brown sugar syrup as it is one of my go to drinks, today I can now say for certain it was not an off day. I had ordered the exact drink at the Target Starbucks and it was perfect and delicious. The one I ordered today was a taste of disappointment and regret, one sip and straight into the garbage it went. I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND GOING TO ANY STARBUCKS OTHER THAN THIS ONE.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jan 28, 2023~So don't go on the weekend they used to have order and pickup door. Well now it's closed the whole lobby is as a matter of fact. Everyone must go thru the drive thru. I got my drinks after 12 min of waiting in the drive thru plus the online order wait time. So very watered down drinks. You should turn off you online order option
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Mar 3, 2023~Do not buy through app here. You will need to sit in line as they don't open their lobby as advertise. I had ordered 10/15 minutes ahead through the app and when I got there, the doors were locked and I had to wait another 20 minutes in line. This was quite upsetting since that's the whole point of mobile orders. The coffee was great but this was my first and last visit to this spot. Since I do work about 5 minutes from this location, many of my colleagues let me know they also have experienced this issue many times.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Apr 1, 2023~Emma at the window was very rude and the coffee was horrible! Will never go back to this Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jan 24, 2022~January 1st (2450 W Bell Road Phoenix 85023) I gave the Barista $40 cash to add to my card. Found out it wasn't added and I've been trying for weeks to get this taken care of.I've spoken to corporate and they are a joke.I guess it's ok for someone to pocket my $40
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Aug 25, 2021~Order a Venti white chocolate mocha with 7 pumps of white chocolate and sweet cream foam. and got a regular iced coffee. Hell yeah yea that best
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jul 29, 2023~So, I bashed this place before when they changed people and it was HORRIBLE so feel like I should do a follow up. They struggled finding good people for a while. NOW they have good employees again. They are friendly, they actually listen to your order and my drink is always good. They have this guy Tyler at the window that is just as friendly as Anthony was and just as great at making sure your order is perfect with a great team to back him up.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Dec 5, 2021~I can't with this Starbucks location anymore. Where is Anthony? After this guy left, something on my order is always wrong and sometimes, they don't even fix it properly. I asked for a Soy Chai Latte with a shot of espresso. I got a triple shot latte so I went back, asked again. They were nice and apologized and said they will fix it...damn it if they didn't give me ANOTHER triple shot latte. The girl said, `"no, it's right, it just don't have a label on it`" but it tastes EXACTLY like the first one that does have a label. This is the 4th time it's happened to me.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Aug 15, 2022~Man what can I say about Starbucks I've been addicted for four years now the only drink that I get from there is the caramel ribbon crunch with extra caramel drizzle on the bottom extra whip cream on the bottom extra crunch pieces on the bottom in a Venti cup the drink itself is just so amazing a grin like a kid in a candy store when they sot it on the counter and call my name out I don't know what I would do if I couldn't have my daily fix thank you Starbucks for this amazing combination of flavor
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jun 27, 2023~The manager Erica is so rude. Highly recommend to go to another Starbucks. They did offer me partial reimbursement and a free drink for the experience but won't be going back to that location.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Dec 2, 2021~This store made my Carmel ribbon crunch perfectly the last Time I came in, I was actually supsrised due to the inconsistency at other locations! Who ever was making drinks on Sunday at 8:39 understood the assignment!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Mar 22, 2019~Great ServiceThis Starbucks is not my usual stop however, it just might be one of my all time favorites. I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks iced white chocolate mocha, I can't think of anything, we'll maybe if you top your coffee off with a vanilla scone.The service at this Starbucks might not be the fastest but it's still phenomenal and the staff are always very friendly. This location is clean, inviting, and feels comfortable and they have seating outside at the patio. I wish they offered more seating inside, as this Starbucks is very busy.My coffee was made exactly the way I order and tasted great. In addition, to the great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack. I really enjoy grabbing a cake pop or two to go.Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jun 25, 2022~Always gets orders wrong and the store has different hrs of operations everyday. Lights will be on and store is closed way before time states on sign. Plus they make you wait in the drive through line when you made a mobile pick up. So by the time I got my food it was cold.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jun 16, 2022~Mobile ordered and it was ready when I arrived 10 minutes later. I didn't like my drink so I came back a few hours later and the shift supervisor gladly remade it and even didn't charge me for a cake pop when I went to order one for my son. She was very nice! Wish I would've gotten her name but it was at 12:30 pm 6/16/22 :) thank you for being so kind!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jan 21, 2023~Why would they take a mobile order when the lobby isn't open?? Have to wait in the drive thru line which defeats the purpose. Would've gone to a different location.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 9, 2023~Do not order ahead here!! Their lobby is NEVER open. They might as well close the location down completely cause they even close early
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 17, 2023~this Starbucks is the worst in all of Arizona. the doors are always locked ! forget about using the bathrooms , never available, the staff are pompous especially the men in this store.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Feb 10, 2020~Yeah thanks Starbucks..I'm not sure I ordered my coffee with some coffee grounds at the bottom of my coffee to give it some texture....better luck next time..
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Oct 3, 2019~Shame on Starbucks I went thru drive thru and got a grande that was obviously not filled up I won't go here again this is the second time they've done this and didn't even add in whipped topping
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Sep 4, 2019~Weary. This is your average Starbucks. It's connected to a chipotle. I'm not a Starbucks girl but I was happy that no one tried to argue with me when I said `"small`". I tried a chicken salad wrap. It was ok. I was starving. But not really worth $9 and I wish I would have remembered the chipotle was next door. When I went to the restroom, it had a lock pad code on the door. Staff needed to let me in which made me a little weary of the area I was in.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Aug 17, 2019~Soraya (apologize if I misspelt it) Took my order and she was incredibly patient with me!! Really appreciate how nice she was and made sure my drink had cinnamon powder on top of it love coming to this location because of the staff, thank you guys!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 1, 2022~Go to a different location! They don't let you use the bathroom here so they expect you to buy their food and their drinks but they don't bother letting you use their restroom. I'm so sick of this. I would say skip this location and go to one who will let you use the facilities. If only I could give zero stars.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Feb 2, 2021~Everyone in here is always friendly. Super happy to help. They move fast and have seen them be cool to the rudest customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Nov 20, 2020~Sweetest guy ever working drive thru today 11/20Made my day whole day before heading into work.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Oct 5, 2022~They don't open their lobby anymore. No signs. No indication that they keep their lobby closed. So I showed up to go inside and read a book and drink a coffee and find out the doors locked.  I decide to run through the drive thru get my coffee and sit and watch from the chipotle next door. Every five minutes, someone pulls up gets out of their car pulls on the door looks around and can't figure out why the doors are locked. Because there are no signs saying the lobby is closed. Let me be clear... if that many people are showing up pulling on the door every few minutes... STARBUCKS IT IS YOUR FAULT FOR NOT MAKING IT CLEAR THAT YOU DONT WANT TO USE YOUR LOBBY ANYMORE. When you look up this location there is a beautiful picture of the lobby. So if you're going to advertise the lobby you should either have it open or take down every picture of your lobby and say the lobby is closed. I really thought that was common sense but I guess I was wrong.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Apr 22, 2022~First time to this Starbucks and I was sooo impresses by Alyssa who took my order ...her attitude is amazing ...she is great!!!Thank you Alyssa!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~May 17, 2021~I had to stop and get myself the iced cinnamon Dolce Latte.  The best!!! I cannot get enough of this stuff.  The baristas here are the best.  Very courteous and go the extra mile to make you happy.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Dec 31, 2019~This Starbucks location is officially known to my family as the `"we're out of that`" Starbucks. Staff is friendly, location is super convenient for me as it's right by my house and right by the I-17 on ramp. My issue with this location is exactly why I call it `"we're out of that`" Starbucks. I've gone there on 4 different occasions where they've been out of the one thing that I want to order. Twice (on two different weeks) they were out of Matcha and couldn't make my wife's iced green tea latte. Two other times I went to order their iced Irish cream latte and immediately I'm interrupted with `"sorry we're out of that`". I'm an occasional Starbucks customer. Maybe I go twice a month for drinks for me and my family. I've almost completely given up on this location because it's so hit or miss whether they will have what I want. I'd rather just drive an extra few blocks to another location that always seems to have everything in stock. It's disappointing because I was so excited to have this location open so close to my home. They really need to get their inventory in order. Being right by the freeway I imagine their demand is high with people stopping by to and from work or on their way somewhere. All the more they should be ordering enough product to meet the demand but they don't seem to have that figured out for whatever reason. Go ahead and roll the dice on this location if you have to, just be prepared to have to drive to another location to get what you really want.  With that said, if they fix this issue of always running out of popular menu items, this review can be changed to 4-5 star review because the few times when I've made a successful order, the drinks have always been on point.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Nov 4, 2019~Went 2 days in a row and they made the drinks wrong. Right info on cup but wrong in the cup. The 2 ND day was a drive through. I ordered soy in my iced coffee. Started drinking it and realized it was milk. Said soy on it. Was sick the rest of the day.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Dec 17, 2019~My favorite location! The staff is so sweet and speedy. Anthony has the best customer service and  always brightens up my mornings.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Feb 21, 2020~Very clean starbucks! Was here on a short trip visiting from LA had a great conversation with a super cute barista named Riley she's very good at her job and also the staff is pleasant overall would come here again next time I'm in AZ with my friends
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Apr 6, 2019~I love Starbucks. I got the double bacon cheddar cause I was super Hungary and the grande java chip which as usual didn't disappoint. I just wish that the sandwiches had time to cool and were served with the coffe cause the sandwiches were too hot to eat at first. They need time to cool so people don't burn their mouth. The bathroom needs paper towels by the door for those of us who don't like touching the door handle after just washing our hands, please? I did, however, appreciate the metal sharps container. Overall, it was a great experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Oct 28, 2019~Kirstie, was exceptionally nice this morning and the whole team was awesome. Monday off to a great start!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Oct 1, 2020~I went here yesterday morning to have my coffee because the one by my house was too busy. I got a hazelnut flat white and for the first time in a long time it came out perfect! It even had the dot it's supposed to have. The girl Alyssa took her time and asked me how I was. Everyone here seemed really genuine and it was a great atmosphere! Will definitely be coming back!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jan 10, 2021~This starbucks on Bell Rd and I17 is the only one I will go to. The staff is always so amazing, go out of their way to have a personable conversation with you and make you feel very welcomed. I really hope they see these reviews to see how much of an awesome job they do every single day. I never have once had a bad experience! Keep up the amazing work!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jun 3, 2020~I love this Starbucks! Every employee is super sweet, especially Jonathan and Isaac! They're efficient and so friendly. Keep it up!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~May 13, 2019~This is my Number One Favorite Starbucks of all time. They understand the concept of EXTRA Caramel, and never once got any of my orders wrong (even when I ask for extras).
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Oct 6, 2019~If any baristas need an example of a clean friendly coffee place this Starbucks is it. The staff there are some of the nicest I've ever met. Very kind and accommodating. My favorite when I go through drive thru is Anthony. He's so welcoming and kind. Can't say enough nice things about him. My favorite Starbucks. BTW I work at another Starbucks but prefer this place hands down
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Aug 6, 2019~The fact I lighter roasts didn't even phase the enjoyment I had when drinking this cup, of course I was indecisive so I went with a great caramel macchiato. Though most frown upon the `"McDonald's`" of coffee I couldn't help but enjoy the awkward yet extremely kind baristas at this location.
Ste 100~5~Oct 1, 2024~The staff were absolutely amazing!!! I pulled up a specialty drink on Google and they were more than willing to help me out! Best of all, it was absolutely delicious!!! I will be returning!!!
Ste 100~2~Dec 21, 2023~Redone interior but basically they got rid of all indoor seating!! And to top it off no misters or heaters outside which means great for drive thru and That's it
Ste 100~4~May 31, 2014~Great drive thru and decent interior. Friendly staff and perfectly made drinks. Outdoor patio area.  Nice location.
Ste 100~5~Jan 8, 2024~Love me some Starbucks. Every store can be different but this one is always on top. The customer service is always great, and the drinks are always made right. Often times something isn't the same at each Starbucks which can be frustrating. However Everytime I've been at this location everything has been great. I always go for iced drinks, so the shaken espresso is always my go to. You can change the syrups and different things to customize it. I love Starbucks. I will always go back here for my coffee fix. The food and cups are also great at Starbucks.
Ste 100~4~Feb 1, 2023~The Starbucks experience has been pretty standard wherever I go. I am a little disappointed with how corporate Starbucks keeps changing out the menu for food items. I really liked the chicken artichoke sandwich. I added an older photo of a Star bucks item I really enjoyed.  It has unfortunately been discontinued. I also really liked the fall drink, the apple spice. I am so sad that they don't have the chicken and quinoa salad anymore. The chicken &amp; quinoa salad came with black beans and greens. It was 27 g of protein per bowl that included chicken raised without antibiotics. It has 1.5 cups of vegetables. The grilled white meat chicken was on top of a spring mix, quinoa, tomato vinaigrette, and cotija cheese. More specifics on the rest of the ingredients are as follows: white meat chicken raised without antibiotics (white meat chicken, water, salt, potato starch, onion and garlic powder, spice) spring mix (contains one or more of the following: lettuce, chard spinach tatso radicchio), quinoa blend (water, vinegar (white red) mild chile vinaigrette tomato puree (water, tomato pastel, pomace olive oil, honey. red and ancho chile puree (red bell pepper, water, dehydrated red chile peppers, dehydrated ancho chile pepper, lemon juice concentrate], roasted red bell peppers, apple cider vinegar salt, contains 2% or less of: lemon juice concentrate. spices, garlic, mustard flour black pepper, natural flavor), tomatoes, black beans (black beans. water salt calgium chloride ferrous gluconate), fire-griled corn (super sweet corn, olive oil, canola oil jicama. cotta cheese (pasteurized milk. sail, enzymes, culture, powdered cellulose. I can only hope they bring it back. When I asked at the store they didn't think it was coming back. I can always hope.
Ste 100~3~Feb 7, 2024~Had stopped there and take a coffee. Its good location however service was not that quick as I expected. The staff was nice though. I did takeout some pastries too. It was well-baked and the quality was so amazing. I love my coffee balanced flavor and has smooth flavor. Price was good.
Ste 100~3~Feb 1, 2024~Friendly service! I like this Starbuck location. They  make freshly brewed coffee. It smell so good and has well-balanced flavor. The Pastries were great and well-baked. The place has nice ambiance and good seating.
Ste 100~3~Mar 9, 2021~SB in large shopping center that does not allow indoor seating. The patio was dirty and needed cleaning. Baristas were not friendly.Below avg Starbucks.
Ste 100~2~May 23, 2024~Who gets rid of interior seating in a place like AZ? This doesn't make sense for the area or for a coffee shop in general. Starbucks lost its way.
Ste 100~1~Dec 27, 2023~Absolutely terrible service. Never coming here, you'll be disappointed. Lots of other options neatby.
Ste 100~1~Feb 14, 2023~Been here many times, and seems like all this place wants to sell is milk with a splash of coffee... ordering a drink from here is like the hunger games, `"May the odds be ever in your favor!`"
Ste 100~5~May 12, 2022~I actually really like this location. They are consistent, friendly, clean and actually remember us. There is something nice about having a neighborhood place to drive thru or stop by and share a beverage. There is a lot of value in that outside just the drink. Good peeps
Ste 100~1~May 1, 2023~Service was awful and the cashier lady was rude. I know it's the morning but geez. I don't expect everyone to be happy in the morning but I don't expect to be dogged out either. Wont be coming back.
Ste 100~5~Aug 27, 2021~I came in early on a Friday and had to leave for work without my drink. The baristas working asked me to come back in later to get my drink or a refund ( no biggie I didn't allow myself enough time) I came in later at lunch and requested my drink which they made, and then Angie and a tall blonde gentleman (I didn't catch his name) both gave me a gift card for a drink! Y'all are seriously the best! Thank you for your excellent customer service!!!
Ste 100~1~Jun 10, 2023~Baristas are not trained by Starbucks on how to make beverages here. The Macchiato was nowhere close to on that is made elsewhere. Even the caramel Frappuccino had neither any coffee taste or coconut milk. Very rushed baristas not knowing what they are doing here. Where is management as they are literally running into into each other when making these drinks.
Ste 100~5~Jul 5, 2022~I will always chose this location over the others in the area. The baristas are always so nice and fast. The drinks are always made perfectly! I appreciate you guys sm!
Ste 100~2~Nov 29, 2022~Legit the worst Starbucks in north Phoenix. If your name is `"fallon`", you need a new job. 1. Waited 35 minutes in the drive thru- and if you have ever been here, you know there's no turning back once you're in line. You're committed whether you like it or not. 2. After 35 minutes of waiting- I was given the wrong pastry. Despite my bag saying the correct order, what was in the bag was NOT what I ordered. 3. Worker was very confused when I came inside and asked for my correct order. Manager had to actually yell `"Fallon, just get her the correct danish`" while she still looked around confused. 4. Another manager comes out and tries to chit chat with me about my `"turkey day`" while incompetent Fallon looks for my order then whispers `"I think we're out of danish`"5. I walk out, lady is walking in with a pastry bag, I ask her if it's my order and she said yes. Our pastries got switched. We switched in the parking lot and called it a day. 6. No apology for making people wait 35 minutes for a freaking coffee. That's absolutely insane.
Ste 100~5~Jan 27, 2022~The best starbies in N Phx. Always top quality and super fast drive through, even during peak!
Ste 100~1~Jul 13, 2022~Rude baristas working on 7/13/22 1230pm.  Didn't ask for the carrier, yet they gave one, held three venti's and one trenta drink, broke apart didn't even apologize just an attitude.  Bad customer service!
Ste 100~4~Feb 16, 2018~After my 1 hr massage at Massage Envy which is next door. I popped over to this Starbucks location to sit down to do some work on their WiFi since I'm tracking on business.  Service was fast, friendly, and my order was perfect.  I had a chicken capresse sandwich for lunch, BBQ chips, and a Mocha Frapp.However I was disappointed that they had no comfy chairs. Everything in this store is wood chairs or metal stools.  I love eating and drinking coffee while sitting back in a comfy chair when I stop in Starbucks.  But oh well.  They have tons of out door seating and patio space. But I sat inside because it was chilly out.
Ste 100~1~Dec 18, 2022~They handed me my drink and it spilled all over the outside of my car, all over me &amp; the inside of it. I asked for them to remake it because it's a $8 drink &amp; when she brought it back out to me she said `"Is this good enough for you.`" I called back to complain and the guy was extremely rude &amp; cutting me off, His explanation that it wasn't their fault the lids don't fit the cup on a $8 drink. So unprofessional &amp; rude. Avoid this location.
Ste 100~5~Dec 2, 2021~Theeee best customer service I have ever gotten from a Starbucks or any coffee shop for that matter! Andrea was super attentive and made great conversation! She was genuinely caring and polite! I promise I am not exaggerating when I say she gave the best customer service to where you want to go back to just because of the service! Andrea set the expectation of how all Starbucks employees should be, truly awesome job and many thanks to her! With her attitude I hope she is the manager or working her way up to that position! happy employees means happy customers!! :)
Ste 100~4~Nov 3, 2018~I'd honestly rate this location a 4.5 and was super happy for a place to sit outside and study while enjoying some coffee and good weather. Bonus that I scored one of the refillable holiday cups on this day. Sometimes the other guests can be inconsiderate like the one listening to her loud iPad soap operas with no headphones on which is really disruptive and annoying to the other patrons. She's been the exception here though. Usually it's pretty pleasant
Ste 100~1~Dec 30, 2018~Went into this Starbucks and witnessed the lead, Peter (either a shift lead or manager, I don't know) openly and loudly refusing to give his one female employee her break because it was `"busy`" (there weren't many people in the store)and because she was asking for her break since she'd been there so long. He specifically said the more she asked him for her break the longer he was going to refuse it to her. He then proceeded to offer a break to his other male employees, until one refused and let the female employee go in his place. This is hugely unprofessional, demeaning, and comes off completely disgusting. Peter needs to re evaluate how he treats his employees/coworkers and maybe receive some management classes. If this was a problem with the employee(which maybe there was a problem, I obviously did not see an entire days worth of interaction) it should be dealt with professionally and not so loudly that all customers are actively watching what's happening.
Ste 100~5~Dec 9, 2019~This location is known for amazing service. Peter, one of the managers is well known for going the extra mile to make customers feel welcome.The bartista's are fast and accurately providing each order. And they laugh at my jokes!
Ste 100~2~Sep 8, 2016~I'm an avid fan of Starbucks &amp; I will admit this is the first time I have had an issue with the actual coffee. Unfortunately I didn't notice until I had already driven 30 minutes to my work... I had coffee grounds at the bottom of my coffee. And not like a few that  I could just ignore but enough that I was continuously sucking it up my straw (see photo). I expected high quality coffee &amp; received a coffee that a novice would make.
Ste 100~5~Jun 4, 2016~May Not Be The Fastest.... but they make a great Iced White Chocolate  MochaA nice start to the day This Starbucks is not my usual stop however, it just might be my favorite. I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks iced white chocolate mocha, I can't think of anything and vanilla scone.The service at this Starbucks might not be the fastest but it's still phenomenal and the staff are always very friendly. This location is clean, inviting, and feels comfortable and they have seating outside at the patio.My coffee was made exactly the way I order and tasted great. In addition, to the great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack. I really enjoy grabbing a cake pop or two to go.Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.
Ste 100~3~Feb 23, 2023~I'm giving a 2 star review because I have had some pleasant experiences at this store, but my most recent ones have caused me to stop coming here. Since I work at Starbucks, I understand the rushes especially in the morning, but I do not understand harsh demeanor towards someone who is completely understanding. I recently got here around 9am, placing my order of 4 standard drinks 25 minutes prior to my arrival. When I get to the window, I have to keep reminding the barista after each drink she hands me that I have more. After about 6 minutes, I finally have 3 drinks, to which I say I am just waiting on one more. She goes on to say that I keep `"adding`" drinks onto my order, although I had ordered all 4 of them in one mobile order. Her and another barista proceed to talk back to me claiming that I keep changing the number of drinks. Their tones got harsher as I stayed at the window. I kept saying that I had one more drink I was waiting on, but they claimed I already got all 4 drinks when I only had 3 in my car. Finally, they managed to find one of my drinks thrown away, which is why the label was missing. That drink was a Sugar Cookie Almondmilk Latte, but what I found out they gave me was just a plain latte with regular milk when I tried it later. Not only did I get talked back to numerous times, but I also received at least one completely incorrect drink.
Ste 100~2~Sep 2, 2018~I try to avoid this starbucks, though drinks almost always come out correctly but customer service has been very spotty and more bad than good. More robotic answers and nothing personalized anymore. I reordered my coffee today through the app, walked by the bar to pick it up, one employee was standing right there reading something and barista was behind the machine,  and another employee Behind the bar, i greeted everyone with a `"good morning`", and I have a loud voice so I'm sure they heard me, but I got no response, then checked my coffee cup to make sure it's move, said `"thank you guys`" and the same, no response. Not sure what happened there but really felt I welcomed and unwanted. The 2 stars is for the coffee prep as it was correctly made.
Ste 100~5~Mar 1, 2022~Awesome customer service, always cheerful. Great communication and the staff makes you feel at home. It is the Starbucks my family chooses to go to when we come into town.
Ste 100~1~Feb 25, 2022~If i could give this starbucks 0 stars I would. They charged us for two extra food items. We waiting nearly twenty minutes for two iced coffees and two pastries. Our drinks WERE HORRIBLE. Had to throw them away. We couldn't go back because we were going to be late to work because we had to stand in line TWICE to get a refund already. Horrible horrible horrible. Will never go back
Ste 100~2~Mar 9, 2019~When you first order your drinks, they're really nice and friendly. Past that, the drinks are good, &amp; terrible customer service. I just came in for 2 drinks and food before work. Two of the workers were rude, and left me standing there. They didn't tell me my drink my ready, or even noticed I had been standing there. And finally I asked if they were my drinks the girl Ana looked at me and said `"oh yeah you can take them`" Like ok??????They only catered to their regulars, I have to remind myself to drive 20 minutes out of my way to another starbucks next time.
Ste 100~5~Dec 22, 2017~On Christmas weekend needed a refreshing drink in between wrapping gifts and the drive - thru convenience was ideal to satisfy my quench ! Also thank bring open until midnight
Ste 100~4~Dec 6, 2017~I always stop by this starbucks on my way to work on weekends, or when I need a substantial amount of coffee and to study. Staff at this location is great. They are always willing to recommend new ways of trying my iced coffee!
Ste 100~1~Aug 8, 2017~I swear, ever since Starbucks got rid of the traditional hand-pulled espresso machines, the drink quality has gone down the toilet. I'm reviewing the SBUX I visited today, but it pretty much applies to them all. Out of the last 10 drinks I ordered, 9 were either wrong in some way or just sucked. The employees have no pride in what they do because there's no skill involved in pushing buttons vs. crafting an awesome drink. When I worked there in 2000, things were different. If you had the skill to make quality drinks quickly, you were on bar. If you sucked, you mostly did cashiering and support duties. We CARED about what we put out, and people loved us. 20+ cups lined up on the bar at any given time during the morning rush, 90% were for daily regulars. Mistakes and dissatisfaction were extremely rare. I had a drink sent back once. The guy claimed his latte wasn't 140 degrees. I plopped a thermometer in it, showed him, and handed it back. He was a regular and should have known better.This is why I rarely go to SBUX! I don't need the hassle and frustration. It ruins a good two hours of my day. Why pay $6 for that? Yet I still go from time to time, and 9/10 of those times I am disappointed.I feel like an idiot for handing the girl a tip in the drive-thru before I got my drink. I should have looked. I would have seen that no, she did not put a dome lid and extra caramel sauce on top like she said she would. That's not the cardinal sin that's prompting this review though. I ordered my drink non-fat, and I was given whole milk. That's not cool! At all! Not only do I hate the taste of a creamy caramel macchiato, I really don't want the extra fat (and whole milk has a LOT of fat). So besides now having a drink that I absolutely don't want, I don't have time to turn around and have it corrected, and I HATE wasting things, so I am obligated to gain a few pounds by drinking this crap. I posted pictures. You can see the sticker says non-fat and the drink is laced with the creamy white fat of whole milk. Tastes gross to me.*I apologize to the good SBUX employees out there. In the event I go again (which is inevitable), I won't be tipping you. It's because you are so few and far between, and I'm done tipping your co-workers who don't take pride in doing a good job.*
Ste 100~5~Oct 26, 2021~Came in needed a hot coffee at 6:30ish under $4 they got it made in less then a minute and were the most enthusiastic people I've ever met great great place highly recommend
Ste 100~1~Dec 22, 2019~12/21/2019, Saturday at 4:30 pm. Used the drive-thru. Our turn to order. We ordered a Citrus Defender/Honey Citrus Mint Tea (M-ball), we were told they were all out of the teas they made it with so we ordered a Mocha   Frappuccino we were told they were out of ice but were still willing to make it with no ice. Now, how in the heck are you going to make a Mocha Frap with no ice and why would you even suggest it? We had to wait for 18 mins to get through the drive-thru with nothing. Unacceptable.
Ste 100~1~Jun 9, 2017~My wife and I love going to Starbucks for iced tea later in the evening. I have been here previously and I order the large black tea mango lemonade. Every time it's different. The most recent time they forgot to put in the lemonade and the mango. When u spend $5.00 on tea it better be right. Hopefully they get there stuff together.
Ste 100~2~Sep 27, 2013~THE SLOWEST AND WEAKEST WIFI of ANY Starbucks!Slow Drive-thruOnly one register open even with long lines.
Ste 100~1~Apr 24, 2013~incredibly slow drive thru.  workers at drive-thru are not friendly or quick.
Ste 100~1~Dec 3, 2019~Me and my son both got a Starbucks and we got really sick not sure if they are  leaving the milk out or what's going on but the manager needs to look into this
Ste 100~5~Apr 5, 2017~Always efficient and friendly. They always get my orders right. Nothing really bad to say. I come here when I am in town visiting.
Ste 100~5~Jan 18, 2018~Well after a slow start up my Starbuck's gets great reviews. Oh, and BTW Starbuck's finally got it right for those of us who want a decent, fast, bread free breakfast.Their new egg bites are the best!!! Two for over four dollars but 170 calories. Served very cute for those of us on the move. Egg white bites are also good but my fav is the bacon cheese. What a great accompaniment to my morning ice coffee.
Ste 100~5~Nov 27, 2018~I absolutely love coming to this Starbucks. The employees are always friendly! Especially Peter; Peter goes out of his way to make personal connections with his customers. He will remember your face and treat you kindly every time you come in. Overall the staff provides a great welcoming environment!
Ste 100~5~Apr 10, 2018~My Happy place before work in the mornings! Great customer service. I  definitely recommend stopping by this location and getting a coffee. You wont regret it!
Ste 100~1~May 2, 2019~I'm never really impressed with their baristas but the location is super convenient. My biggest issue is when I went to get a coffee today. I decided to switch it up because my app has been telling me that I've had a reward for over 3 weeks now. What a great way to start my morning! I drove there in my jammies to start my wonderful day with a fancy coffee. However, Starbucks changed their rewards and I only got a few dimes off. I still paid over 5 bucks for my drink! I was very confused... and Angie was very smug.  She told me that the rewards changed Tuesday. That's dumb! Then, why have i had a reward for weeks? She was very unprofessional in her response of `"I don't make the rules.`" I didn't say you made the rules, ANGIE! You may not make the rules but you are there to provide good customer service which you failed to do. Starbucks app was deleted and this one was uploaded.
Ste 100~3~Jun 24, 2019~Customer service was good but didn't exactly get what I wanted. Just be sure to confirm your drink before you accept it and drive off... cause if not you'll be a bit upset that you spent that money on it.
Ste 100~5~Oct 23, 2015~I love this location. My drink has always been ON POINT! And the drive through is the fastest Starbucks drive through I've ever gone to. I like the location even though its a little bit off the road. They have a cute little patio, and a nice (typical) interior. The girls have always been friendly here as well. I wish I lived a little closer to this one. But its always the one (out of the 5 I pass) I stop at on my way to work once to twice a week.
Ste 100~5~Aug 23, 2018~Shout out to Brandy and the team for making my experience awesome.  Super friendly and helpful.  Green tea matcha latte was perfect! Never been to this location but highly recommend
Ste 100~5~Mar 3, 2019~Had the best experience at the Bucks tonight. Got two drinks for my friends who were with me and we sat and talked with Maestro for a few minutes. Such a funny and relatable guy! I wish there were more of him around. Highly recommend!
Ste 100~1~Oct 13, 2018~Apparently I'm not the only one. This place is dirty. I was standing with several other people that commented along with me at this place was filthy. Maybe next time you visit here you shouldn't go through a drive-thru. You might have a better understanding of what's going on . gross!
Ste 100~1~Sep 23, 2015~This is the closest location to my home but this is a Starbucks I Avoid!!! Having worked for Starbucks for many years in Washington state my addiction to good coffee runs deep and I am Very Familiar with how customers should be treated! This location is the Worst I have ever encountered and I vow never to support that location with any of my revenue. I went in for a pound of coffee and had it ground for a cone filter. Next morning opened the bag to find baby powder fine coffee. I went immediately to the store and asked to exchange it and have it ground again. The partner at the register was unhelpful and at first wanted a receipt but I stated I didn't have it plus I only wanted to get another pound not cash. She accommodated my request but with obvious unpleasant attitude. Next morning same baby fine powder to fine for my machine. I return again...trying to be pleasant I suggest that perhaps they need to recalibrate the grinder which can get off after time. The shift supervisor exchanged the coffee but Refused to Grind it because apparently I'm difficult to please!!! What!!!!When I managed a Starbucks I would have 1. Apologize for the inconvenience of coming in several times! 2. Grind a bit made sure it was correct with the customer then grind the pound. 3. Offered a cup of brewed coffee while they waited!! That was in the 90s when they really Trained Baristas now it seems sadly that Starbucks has lost it's Soul for Service. Very Sad example of that is at this location for sure!! Drive on to the Thunderbird location which is better.
Ste 100~1~Dec 25, 2020~Today was very upsetting going to this Starbucks. I understand it gets crazy during the holidays, let alone Christmas. However, the employees working on Christmas could have handled this situation A LOT better. I ordered over the mobile app because I figured it they would've been crazy busy and this would've made the process a whole lot easier. So I ordered at 4:10pm and it was supposed to be ready at 4:17pm. Mind you, they closed earlier today due to it obviously being Christmas. So I went to go pick up my three drinks and food and see the line was practically to the other side of the parking lot where sprouts is. I was shocked but assumed I could go inside to quickly pick up my TO GO drinks and leave. Turns out they closed the lobby completely. I called just to clarify I have to pick up my mobile order in the drive through, no one answered. So considering I already paid for my drink (and my sister paid for hers and I was also picking her online order up) I had to wait in the drive through. No problem! It's Christmas, what do you expect? I sit in line for almost half an hour and at this point I am parked right in the drive through, right as you enter, SO CLOSE! That's when I see three Starbucks employees come out carrying those chairs they have on their patio and set four of them right in front of my CAR. IT WAS 4:45pm!! When I had rolled down my window and politely asked the barista how I would get my money back from my mobile order, she said `"I don't know maybe call Starbucks`" and walked away. Wow. They had another 15 minutes before they closed and they cut off I would guesstimate about 15 cars behind me. I understand it's the holidays and the employees want to be with their families BUT they handled this situation horribly. Very truly disappointed in this Starbucks considering I have been coming here for years. I paid for multiple drinks and food almost an hour ahead of time and NEVER got them. I know what it's like to work on Christmas and in customer service and I know they've probably had some rude customers today so I'm sure the baristas were overwhelmed but I truly felt the need to do this review and I have never reviewed anyone before so I just hope we can all do better.
Ste 100~2~Oct 9, 2015~Meh. I only go to this location while I am at work because it is within walking distance. If time permits, I swing by the new location on Thunderbird and 19th while I'm on my way to work.This location is consistent and I never really have a long wait. However their customer service sucks. They aren't very friendly and get irritated when you ask questions. I was in there today and while waiting for my tea, I witnessed some employees screwing around and put cups on top of their heads? What are we, 5? They're lucky I work in the plaza and that I get flourished with gift cards, otherwise I would go elsewhere. Forever hoping a Dutch Bros or Teavana opens close by!
Ste 100~1~Apr 23, 2020~Employees are wearing mask but not gloves?? Handing out wet drinks with bare hands? Isn't that going to cause transmission of the virus? CDC says most infections are from touching something and then your face.
Ste 100~5~Jan 20, 2015~Love Coffee!, Friendly Drive-ThruThis location is ALWAYS packed with a line of cars but that never scares me at this location, they are super fast and friendly!
Ste 100~3~Oct 8, 2014~Didn't allow me to put up business cards for pet sittin, but all the other Starbucks in Scottsdale do?Www.ArizonaHappyPaws.com
Ste 100~1~Mar 23, 2018~Let's make this short and easy. Walked up to the register no one greeted us. 4 partners were in a conversation, looked at us and continued with their conversation. Finally after i made contact with one of them they took my order with minimal interaction. Waited for my drinks. Girl on bar slide over drinks across the bar without calling them out. No name // no drink label. She was still in conversation. When did work place become all talk and no work? Btw. Only that one girl on bar had an apron and sh made my ice coffee wrong. She was too busy talking for me to correct her. Please get better employees. Better people need jobs
Ste 100~5~Feb 26, 2020~Love this Starbucks! Here every other week for a Bible study. Peter is the best barista! Really caring, super attentive to detail and amazing memory!
Ste 100~2~Oct 2, 2017~The coffee is great, it always has been, especially when you get one for free! I'm very pleased I get to enjoy a salted caramel mocha hot AND iced. Although, the outcome had turned out for the better on my end, I'd much rather they got it right the first time. The staff this morning weren't exactly starbuck standard quality staff. They normally greet you; and believe it or not, when you order they actually pay attention to your order. You'll even here a, `"thanks for coming!`" on your way out.. Well, not this location. Happy Monday!
Ste 100~4~Dec 5, 2010~This was my 3rd time coming to this location in about a year. I came with my friend Jess after a movie. We both got the caramel brulee frappucino. She got the chocolate croissant &amp; I wanted to try the vanilla bean scones but they were out, again. So I got the marshmallow dream bar &amp; iced lemon pound cake. This was my 1st time eating outside though. The tables were all a bit dirty but it was a nice day to sit outside &amp; chat for a lil. I docked a star for being out of stuff &amp; the outside tables being dirty.
Ste 100~2~Dec 14, 2014~Painfully slow. It's not okay to be slow during the morning rush. The cashiers could get customers through quickly but could not serve quickly. Communication between the staff seemed lost. The woman at serving counter asked what I ordered 10 mins after I paid. She had to ask someone to get it started, so I'm glad she asked because it seemed as if no one knew I even ordered it. Not sure if this is what it's like going through the drive-thru but I don't think I'll be returning.
Ste 100~1~Jan 16, 2018~Been to this location twice. Both times my order was incorrect. The second mistake was worse than the first. The staff appears amateurish and unsure. They all look lost.
Ste 100~3~Sep 25, 2016~They have friendly staff but can't seem to really follow direction. If someone is asking for something specific weather it be Iced, light iced, sweetened, unsweetened or perhaps 7 scoops instead of 3 you should do as asked. These drinks are not cheap especially when you order them every morning (it starts to add up) I find this very offensive that when I asked for my drink to be made a certain way I get it the way you want to make it. This happens at least 3x a week with this location. Make the drinks how they are ordered and not how you'd like too. I get that you a very busy but you are also busy because of the business that we bring to you.
Ste 100~4~Feb 9, 2012~If you hate people who are really cheerful early in the morning, do not come here; it is staffed by the brightest-eyed and bushiest-tailed baristas I have ever seen. For me, at least, the positive and pleasant interaction with other humans is as much of a pick-me-up as the coffee. I can't speak for the other patrons.Otherwise, a Starbucks is a Starbucks is a Starbucks.
Ste 100~4~Jan 25, 2011~I'm not a coffee person so I always end up getting tea. But, place was quiet, clean, and friendly. What more can I say - it was a Starbucks?
Ste 100~3~Sep 8, 2012~I mean it's a typical Starbucks, nothing really stands out about it.The drive through isn't the quickest, but the baristas are always very  friendly. I am grateful for the drive through either way, because some other Starbucks that are convenient to my routes don't have one! Also, since it's in a rather busy stretch of Bell Rd, it's easy to forget it's there. Look for Pei Wei, and keep heading towards Greenway Pkwy.My order has never been wrong, so that's also a plus.I get iced green or passion tea 90% of the time, green tea frap with soy the other 10%, always tasty!
Ste 100~5~Jan 19, 2019~The drive thru is always pretty pick quick. The blonde woman with the glasses that works the drive thru window in the morning (usually Fridays) is always very nice. I probably go about one or two times a week to this location and she's started to remember me.
Ste 100~1~Mar 22, 2016~I have gone to this location many times because it is very convenient and I always order a triple espresso with caramel drizzle. I feel that this is a very simple order and not a soul in the world would be able to mess it up. Apparently, I was wrong on multiple occasions. Yes, it is my responsibility to let them know if my order is wrong but I think that someone who gets a triple espresso wrong multiple times shouldn't be working at a coffee shop. Not only that, but each time I have received two shots instead of three. I'm never going there again.
Ste 100~1~Sep 19, 2019~I use to go the extra mile to come to this Starbucks because everything I ordered was excellent. This past month my coffee has tasted so bad that I've had to ask to remake my drink every visit. I kept thinking maybe someone was new so I would go back and try again. It's been terrible, I'm done giving this Starbucks chances. If you're into burned tasting coffee, this is the place for you!
Ste 100~5~Apr 28, 2017~Always friendly and fast Enjoying my coffee date with my husband. Our first day off in a long time. And always starbucks to start off our day `"Feelin' that vibe in a Beat of a Coffee!!!!!`" Wooohooooo!!!!!
Ste 100~3~Dec 14, 2016~The male barista with a man bun was having some internal struggle the last time we went in. He was being a real jerk while we were ordering... Terrible customer service coming from that man. Usually a pretty decent Starbucks other than this specific time. Fast service
Ste 100~5~Dec 8, 2018~Best customer service I've ever gotten at a Starbucks was right here! All of the baristas are friendly, seem happy to be there and to share their interest in coffee. Special shout-outs must be given to Mase - who wears glasses and a beanie - who advised me on the amazingness of blonde ristretto shots. This Starbucks seems to really get it with the customer service.
Ste 100~5~Nov 5, 2016~I go to this location every weekend. Always good service. This weekend my sister is here from Virginia. She wanted a regular coffee with cream and sugar. I decided on a Venti Pumpkin Spice. Great service and coffee.
Ste 100~1~Feb 8, 2017~First Starbucks I've been in where I came away saying that the place was filthy. Sorry but true!
Ste 100~2~Jul 3, 2015~I hate writing a bad review... The last two times I have gone through their drive through I ask for an Americano with 2 inches of steamed half-and-half... Both times I get my beverage and I'm halfway home and realize they have not put a drop of half-and-half in.  So I drive back to walk inside to tell them. And they do offer an apology.. Not one time did they offer to comp my drink even though they've wasted about 15 minutes of my time getting home and then getting back just to get my half-and-half.  Not only that but the second time I tell them, they continue to make about seven drinks before they get to mine... The people seem nice but as far as customer service goes I give them 2 stars
Ste 100~1~Feb 6, 2019~Went inside on a Sunday afternoon, not busy. However every table/chair was taken but clearly not everyone was a customer. Order a simple grande hot chocolate with whipped cream. After an unfriendly greeting and service I waited 20 minutes for my beverage. Which I had to put my own hot guard around my cup, get my own stirrer, and grab my own straw! Walked away with no acknowledgement from the barista. Went outside to make my way to my car, opened the lid to stir, it was filled up half way with no whipped cream!! Why pay for a grande and receive a size tall?! And too lazy to spray whipped cream on top to cover your other laziness of not filling it up all the way?! What a joke this place was! Never coming to this location again, apparently I ask for too much with a $4 hot chocolate sheesh! Seeing how there's a Starbucks on every corner...just go to different better one!
Ste 100~2~Sep 28, 2015~I came for the grate coffee and they forgot to put the sweetness, and the patio it was dirty , and need an update. Looks just like a table in a dirty sidewalk. And they wear a table of guys making a big noise playing dominos.
Ste 100~4~Aug 10, 2015~Quick,  friendly,  consistent.  Never any problems here. Usually have the pastries in stock aND drive through lune moves fast. Thanks!
Ste 100~5~Dec 4, 2016~By far my favotite Starbucks. I  now live a block away from a Starbucks, and still drive 30 min to come to this one. Huge shout out to the staff and especially Christy. Thank you for everything
Ste 100~5~Mar 28, 2018~We love Starbucks! Great drinks and they are always consistent. This location has friendly staff. Love the drive-through too.
Ste 100~5~Jun 9, 2012~Love this place in the morning....they are friendly.and great to work with and never get my drink wrong.
Ste 100~2~Dec 19, 2012~Ummmm... can I please get some iced coffee with my soy milk? Two times in a row that I could barely taste the coffee in my drink. The quality of drink is not worth the long wait in the drive through. The wait in the drive thru is always lengthy. If I ever visit this location again I will consider bringing a travel size board game.
Ste 100~5~Jun 16, 2015~Super friendly staff last night. Just sweet people. It makes a difference really. Went late around 830pm and was able to get a drink for the lady who had a rough day. Good job ladies and thanks again.
Ste 100~1~Aug 1, 2018~I went to this starbucks earlier and ordered a pineapple tea infused lemonade and a mango dragonfruit refresher. i got a peach tea lemonade and a strawberry green tea instead. the guy red head at the window was very rude and acted like my service meant nothing. I think every time I visit this location I get horrible service and they always get my order wrong. I've never had an experience at this location where they get my order right, or seem like they enjoy working there at all.
Ste 100~1~Jul 3, 2014~seriously the slowest drive-thru with the poorest customer service! I am lucky if my drink is ever correct! Guess I am the fool for coming here every few times in hoping that they have improved! Another fail on July 3 at 2:37 PM :)
Ste 100~5~Jan 6, 2015~This is the only Starbucks that treats their customers with a great attitude and great smiles, I got a grande white mocha frap and it was super fast and friendly, I enjoy the drive thru, when I get a break at work and want something cold, this is where I come to..good job guys!!
Ste 100~5~Nov 23, 2015~I work very close to this Starbucks location. I go through the drive thru almost every morning, and the line is always very long, BUT the staff is so quick on making everyone's drinks. They also make them perfect every time!!!
Ste 100~5~Nov 20, 2011~Some of the best service of any Starbucks - reasonably fast with an upbeat smile to help start my day on the right foot.  Has some of the `"local`" coffee shop vibe to it, even though it is a chain.
Ste 100~5~Sep 12, 2015~I absolutely love this location. The baristas are amazing. Peter is so friendly and actually one of the reasons I am a returning customer at this location. Friendly faces, fast service, and great beverages!
Ste 100~5~Mar 21, 2014~Really good service and coffee. My sister and I both tried hot hazelnut macchiatos for the first time. The weather was basically right in between hot and cold so we had a hard time figuring out which temperature drink to get. Our stepmom got a java chip frappuchino and after taking a sip we almost regretted getting the hot macchiatos. But then after sitting with the decision for a little bit (and taking a few more macchiato sips) we realized that our drinks were about as good. They stop brewing decaf coffee after 12pm so we had to wait a little extra for a pour over decaf but we spent the time listening to music in my car. On accident at the speaker, the barista said `"just pull up and your drinks will be here`" and I accidentally said `"I can't wait to see you.`" It was a slip of the tongue and I was slightly embarrassed to pull up. But I'm over it now and drinking my drink from this great Starbucks.
Ste 100~5~Aug 3, 2015~This is my go to Starbucks.  I'm here all the time. Love the service and my drinks are always consistent. Sometimes it's busy and have to wait, or they forget that I don't want the whip cream on top, but I'm not one to get upset about it.
Ste 100~4~Jun 30, 2015~Starbucks is pretty much the McDonald's of coffee.  Not cheap but you know you will get the same thing the same way at every single location.  The coffee is good, I like the dessert element they make coffee into.  The food is ok and you can usually count on it being consistent and fresh.  The writing of your name on the cup in TOTALLY obtuse and weird phonetic fashion has got to be something they either train them for or look for that quality when they are hiring.  The staff is not ignorant and they are always pleasant and courteous.  I love the new Cool Refreshers to take to yoga!  Yum.  I also like the new app they have which makes the whole ordering, paying and tipping process cashless.  That makes it convenient and make a me more likely to search out a Starbucks.
Ste 100~3~May 6, 2011~The place lacks a bit of regular cleaning, both inside and outside. The cashiers has a tendency to do personal conversations during hours. Far for the best best Starbucks I have been to. Maybe service is better from the drive-thru?
Ste 100~4~Feb 27, 2014~A perfectly serviceable location with pleasant baristas and a short wait.  My cocoa and my husband's tea were great and made quickly.  In a shopping center full of odd things, it's a nice find.  It also has a drive-through and a few outside tables under a canopy (they face into a parking lot, so not that exciting).
Ste 100~5~Nov 7, 2011~I just love this Starbucks!  Brandie, Sondra, Krissy, Patty and  the whole gang are just the best!  They're are my extended family!
Ste 100~4~Jun 30, 2011~This is my go to location on the way to work. They are open super early and in the same direction that I'm travelling. I hate going out of my way.  The staff is very friendly and informative about their product offerings.
Ste 100~5~Aug 2, 2014~I come out of my way to go to this Starbucks. I've tried the location on Agua Fria and the location at Bell and 7th, but they all pale in comparison to this location! The employees are always friendly and kind and the wait never is long.
Ste 100~5~Aug 21, 2014~Fast drive thru &amp; friendly baristas.  Just wish they had a clover machine for the better iced coffees
Ste 100~1~Sep 27, 2019~bad service. dint do the coffe like i had ask. when i ask if they could fix it they just pore more into cup and made a mess of it. $6 coffee cant even clean the cup
Ste 100~5~Nov 30, 2009~No need to discuss the menu, we all have our favorite...such as a carmel frapp for me.  But I have to mention the service at this location.  Normally, I frequent the drive-thru.  They have never given me an incorrect order and they are super friendly.  Inside is very well maintained and the seating outside is nice.  I love my local starbucks!
Ste 100~4~Feb 22, 2012~The people are great. Always friendly, always smiling. There's a drive-through too, sometimes the line can be a bit long, especially early mornings between 730 and 830.
Ste 100~5~Mar 3, 2013~Great spot, lightning fast service. Good merch selection. Knowledgeable staff..
Ste 100~4~Sep 6, 2011~One of the better ones in town. Quick, friendly, consistent quality.
Ste 100~2~Oct 24, 2012~Irony at its finest. I pulled into the drive thru of this location knowing I would write a review, since everyone knows if you use their drive thru you have time to kill, and I was surprised by how quickly things moved today. The line was fully stacked to the end of the entrance and I managed to make it through to get my 2 drinks and a bagel all by the time I was done writing this review from my phone (about 7 minutes.....minus the extra minute + the girl in front of me took with feeling the need to socialize with an employee in the drive thru line....). Hopefully this is a sign that 20 minute drive through runs are a thing of the past an they will keep this up. For now, 2 stars....keep your butts in gear with less wait time and this location could certainly jump a few stars. Time will tell.
Ste 100~4~Aug 7, 2013~As with all your Starbucks, its coffee its hot and its a bit over priced but its better than fast food coffee. I just wish they had an express checkout for people who didn't want 20 items in their coffee.
Ste 100~4~Dec 31, 2014~Friendly and quick, my favorite Starbucks in Phoenix. In the same plaza as Jamba Juice too.
Ste 100~1~Sep 6, 2013~If it were only a review for the girl at the front, who got got my order perfect, we would give it a 5 star rating. However, the rating was diminished by 4 stars because of the incompetent man in the back. He got simple order incorrect 3 times. Upon finally getting it right, he forgot to put Carmel on the top as requested an payed for. After this he gave my sister iced tea, without shaking it, sweetening it, or putting it over ice. Really??
Ste 100~4~Nov 22, 2011~I love this Starbucks! It's as close to a neighborhood coffee place this part of Phoenix has. The staff there are always super friendly &amp; chit-chatty w/ me (which I adore) &amp; never had an issue w/ my orders. I tend to order different things a lot, &amp; so far so good. The Vanilla Scones are yummy, I must say.
Ste 100~5~Jul 24, 2013~Ham &amp; cheese croissant,  this is a new breakfast venture for me normally I stick with the delicious bacon gouda sandwich.
Ste 100~5~Apr 5, 2011~I love this starbucks! Very friendly people. They are the only one so far that gets my drink right everytime.
Ste 100~1~Dec 2, 2016~INCONSISTENT -   If my review was based solely on the friendliness of the staff - They'd get 5 stars. But unfortunately I do not go there for friendliness, I go there for coffee. And based on my coffee, they get 1 star. I order cream in my coffee. One day it has barely any cream and then the next day it has so much cream in it that it's undrinkable. I understand you want to be fast and get the drinks out as fast as possible - But slow the heck down and make a drink that's actually drinkable and not 90% cream to 10% coffee - Disgusting. They need to have a standard measurement of how much to add so it will always be the same drink that you got the day before.
Ste 100~3~Nov 25, 2016~While we LOVE Starbucks I'm only giving this location 3 stars. The kids steamers were WAY TOO HOT.  Had to take the lids off to let the milk cool down and wrap the outside of the cups in napkins.  Hard thing to do when there are more kids than adults in the car!
Ste 100~5~Dec 9, 2016~I come to this place frequently. Very convenient and its very close to me. The staff is always friendly inside or through the drive through. Only bad thing would be its a small place, and sometimes it can be busy and not much seating. Other than that is a comfortable and friendly environment.
Ste 100~2~Dec 10, 2014~Normally I have a great experience when I go to this Starbucks. What Im complaining about might seem a little petty, but its really just the principle. Starbucks will ask for your name and write it on the cup so they can call your name when its ready. Nice personal touch. Well when I ordered my drink I told her my name. I go by Aaron. Its my middle name. Well she starts to spell it Erin. The female spelling. I quickly saw what she was doing and corrected her. She continues to write the girls name, looks at me and shrugged her shoulders as if she didnt care. Her message of expressions to me were as, im to busy to spell it correctly and you need to deal with it. Well my message to you starbucks is there are plenty of places to spend 20 bucks on coffee and food everymorning. If you're going to try to act personal please teach your employees to at least pretend like they care. Even if they are busy and having a rough morning. I like happy people serving my coffee.
Ste 100~5~Jun 6, 2015~Favorite Starbucks to go to! They have tables out to relax, service is always friendly, never had a problem here and always get what i request in my drink like extra extra caramel! Even if this Starbucks is not the closest, this location will be number one. Very convenient with stores all around and entrance and drive thru exit are easy to enter and exit.
Ste 100~1~Oct 26, 2012~I'm not a Starbucks regular, but I was with friends who wanted to go here for breakfast. To be fair I've never once had a good experience at any Starbucks, and this was no exception. To me, Starbucks is always crowded, noisy, and has slow and rude service. Overall too stressful for me, if I want coffee I want a relaxing experience.On this trip, I ordered a breakfast sandwich, whichever one was featured in all the pictures on the menus. I asked for it to have turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. This totally confused the barista who for some reason thought I wanted two sandwiches. We got our stuff to go and getting outside was like a blessing as it was so much quieter outside.  I opened my package and found a completely different sandwich from what I ordered. My friends then explained that Starbucks doesn't customize sandwiches for customers and what I got was a sandwich called the turkey bacon. I have no clue why the barista couldn't have explained that to me instead of just giving me the wrong thing. there are no signs indicating this and as a non-regular I wouldn't have known. My friends couldn't explain it to me at the time of ordering because the store was so noisy and loud they would have had to scream at me. The sandwich I received was bland and I only ate a small part of it before throwing it out. The only other item I got was from the cold case, so they couldn't screw that up because I picked it myself. But yeah, apparently ordering one item is too difficult and they will screw it up.
Ste 100~5~Jun 26, 2015~I literally love this starbucks, i mean i love all of them in general, ive been a coffee drinker for years now and im only 28 but i crave the caramel frapss this location is close to my job so im never late, its kind of funny, but i tell my coworkers, no other starbucks makes my coffee like this one, yes its weird, but hey all have a different taste and this location makes it just perfect for me! Thanks!
Ste 100~2~Mar 16, 2015~My advice is: if you're in the area and you want a Starbucks, but you're in a rush, go to the one in Target, in the opposite parking lot to this one. You'll have to walk in the store, but at least you're sure to receive the right drink, and quickly.I've been to this Starbucks drive through many times, and I've had to go inside and exchange my order almost every one of them. There's nearly always a confusion at the speaker, even when I order a basic drink. I've ordered a tall macchiato and gotten a venti iced mocha, and other similar mistakes. (Even during uncrowded hours.) And, I have an allergy to ingredients common in many of Starbucks' drinks, so I am unable to just shrug and drink the mistake beverage. (Not to mention that these drinks are too pricey to settle for something you didn't want.) I have to go inside and try to simply explain to the employees that my drink is wrong and again tell them the one I need instead. It usually takes a while, because I have to wait for any people in front of me, and sometimes they've even messed up two or three times. Then my use of the drive through is defeated- the reason I go to the drive through is for a quick trip. I've been to many other Starbucks, all of which have no problem quickly and accurately making my order. The drinks themselves are made well, of course, but come on. Train your employees more thoroughly, fix your speaker, or do whatever you need to do to increase your accuracy. In the meantime, many erroneous visits have taught me a lesson. I will not be going to this location again.
Ste 100~4~May 24, 2013~I love coffee and i love Starbucks coffee and thisbstarbucks is next to my sons school and onvmy way home its always pretty fast and good
Ste 100~3~Nov 21, 2013~This Starbucks is right next to my work so I've gone there before sometimes! Don't go through the drive thru if you are in a hurry. Sat in line for ten mins with only two cars in front of me. This has happened multiple times. The employees are great, but I would suggest just parking and going in!
Ste 100~5~Jul 15, 2014~If you haven't tried star bucks , you're missing out . Great great quality drinks &amp; never fails to be the highlight of my day.
Ste 100~2~Nov 9, 2014~Have had my order messed up each time over the last 3 visits, employees don't seem to be working very hard.... Much better locations elsewhere.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jul 17, 2022~July 16th @6:16pm we visited Starbucks inside the target. I'd give it no stars if I could. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. There was a girl named Aj and she was helping us along with the other girl that I wish I could've gotten her name!! But she wasn't showing her name tag like the other employee. Figures. The girl hiding the name tag WAS SO INAPPROPRIATE. Hitting on a guy and blaming the blender on why we didn't get our NOT BLENDED drinks. STACY jumped in and could care less on what we had to say. Trying to protect her inappropriate employee. Never coming to this starbucks putting a bad name even on target so upsetting . I hope the others that were waiting as well got there money refunded!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Mar 28, 2021~Rude baristas! 4 times in a row I had a bad experience with 4 different baristas about their services:  - Charged more and did not give you a receipt unless you ask. I always order 1 type of drink and realized the difference in price. When I asked her why she could not explain herself and try to fill up my coffee cup with milk. - Did the wrong order and did not have attempt to make a new drink. - Mumbled to herself about customers loud enough to let them hear her (called them cheap). What kind of service is that? - Had attitude  I will not come back again! 4 times in a row is too much!I hope you - the manager of this Starbucks can read this feedback from me and will take some action.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Apr 9, 2021~I've been to this Starbucks a lot and loved it until these last several trips. I've asked for extra caramel and even paid extra for extra sauces and syrups and they didn't give them to me. This is the third time now.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Aug 22, 2019~Starbucks coffee tastes burned to me and I can not see where they get off charging that much for a cup of black burned coffee. I honestly would not even stop here if my grandkids didn't like their cake pops. Even the tea is terrible. Used to taste good. Maybe they burned it too
Frys-Phoenix #617~5~Jan 9, 2023~Tacoma and the other barista with jet black hair make the BEST coffee. I love that they are fast and always make my drink the way I want it.
Frys-Phoenix #617~1~Jun 30, 2024~Who ever works Sundays  afternoon shift seems miserable, rude not friendly at all. Have a attitude and don't even let you finish ordering your drinks. Why work at a place that you need customer service?
Frys-Phoenix #617~1~Apr 22, 2023~The worst experience I've ever had at a Starbucks in my life!!!! Not only was the drunk disgusting the girls that work there were awful. They flipped out because the drink was made wrong like it was my fault and it ended in a yelling fight, I can't believe they still have jobs with the way they treat customers.
Frys-Phoenix #617~3~Nov 16, 2018~Starbucks is my wife's favorite and I don't think anything is left in their menu which we didn't tried. All thanks to my wife to get us starbucks gold membership. Their coffee taste good without any second thought but the price they charge for them is not justifiable. For taste 5/5 but seeing value for money 3/5.
Frys-Phoenix #617~5~Apr 22, 2023~I had the best experience with this location. I was having a bad day and didn't realize anyone could notice however Alexis, gisselle, and Jannette not only made sure I was entirely satisfied but lifted me up with their positive energy.  All baristas introduced themselves to me and made sure I was satisfied with my order. Also I could taste the coffee instead of just straight milk from other locations I have visited. I highly recommend!
Frys-Phoenix #617~5~Jan 6, 2023~Great location and workers. Coffee and drinks are delicious and line moves quickly. I don't why such low reviews.
Frys-Phoenix #617~3~Nov 5, 2021~I  just ordered the pink drink and they barley put any of the strawberry drink in it! literally all I taste is watered down coconut milk with strawberries in it. Hope they don't do this again if I come back. Come on Starbucks.
Frys-Phoenix #617~1~Jul 28, 2021~I will never go to this location again!! Even if it's close to me. The snobby girls that work in the morning are something else, never experienced such rudeness at Starbucks. Not to mention they can't take orders correctly or make a decent 3 item coffee. I'll drive future from now on.
Frys-Phoenix #617~4~Jul 17, 2015~Shopping and StarbucksI have to admit I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks store inside of Frys. This location is one of my favorite. The service is great and the staff are very friendly.  This location is clean and feels comfortable. I can do my shopping and enjoy a latte at the same time.My coffee is always made the way I order and tastes great. In addition, to great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack.Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.
Frys-Phoenix #617~5~Nov 27, 2013~Finally a Starbucks on my way to work. It's inside Frys Marketplace.  Nothing really to say other than it's new and clean and it's Starbucks.
Frys-Phoenix #617~2~Jul 1, 2018~This Starbucks is usually pretty decent, but today, I happened to get a couple of rude workers. The Starbucks location closes at 8:00pm, but I roll in at around 7:50 and the girl looks at me, looks back at her male co-worker and says they're closed. The hours online states that their hours are from 5am-8pm, not 5am-7:50pm. Disappointing!
Frys-Phoenix #617~1~Nov 17, 2017~Worst service I have ever received at a Starbucks. I tried to use my gift card and apparently it couldn't scan and he didn't know how to get the money any other way. That was fine, but then I got in my creme brulee frappe and it was made incorrectly. I also ordered a cheese danish which was hard and stale. The barista's didn't seem like they were interested in making things right, but they did remake my drink and it was very good. I will likely never return to this location even though I pass by often.
Frys-Phoenix #617~4~Aug 6, 2015~They are ALWAYS friendly to me here. I see them interacting pleasantly with other customers as well. This crew works hard. My drink is correct and usually made in a timely manner. It's not their fault that everyone orders Frappuccinos and overly complicated espresso beverages. It's still new looking, spacious, and clean. I love that they are open pretty late for an in-store Starbucks. Nothing like grabbing a refreshing iced tea, doing your shopping, and getting a refill on the way out. So thankful for this store!
Frys-Phoenix #617~1~May 12, 2017~The barista was very rude... and didn't have a name tag... he kept asking WHAT?! Instead of politely asking again for your order... then when he was about to put the drizzle I asked if he could do caramel INSTEAD of chocolate... and he rudely claim he has to charge extra... when the price is the same on both items... guy is extremely slow it took about 20mins to get my drink... and my drink was very watery...
Frys-Phoenix #617~2~Dec 25, 2015~This is one of the slowest Starbucks ever.  The drive through is always 10 cars deep and takes about thirty minutes to get coffee. Very limited parking in front of the place also.
Frys-Phoenix #617~3~Aug 16, 2017~Jordan was pretty rude before I even received my coffee, after receiving my two coffees we immediately noticed they didn't taste as usual. We are regular here and other locations and usually receive great service. Kyle at this location is the MVP he is usually here when we come in and provides exceptional service. I'm glad he was there when we brought the drinks to Jordan's attention because he made them correctly! Although I was disappointed when I brought the drinks up and said they didn't taste quite right and Jordan just looked to Kyle and rudely said `"idk you make them`".
Frys-Phoenix #617~3~Sep 7, 2014~Inside a fry's. Nice and clean. Rather new. Nice seating area to enjoy the Wi-fi. Starbucks is Starbucks. Nothing extraordinary to type about.
Safeway~1~Nov 29, 2023~The lady was coughing sneezing and had a mask on... I asked her if she had a cold and she said yes‍ I know it's the holiday season but please stay home next time so you don't get other people and there families sick. She literally had her hand all over the cups, lids etc. throwing these away and headed to a different Starbucks.
Safeway~3~May 25, 2022~Tried the new chocolate cream cold brew drink. It needed a bit more chocolate flavor, but the cream foam and coffee drink were refreshing. The idea tea and lemonade was also refreshing.
Safeway~1~May 14, 2019~I placed an online order for two unsweetened green teas and a hot mocha. It is suppose to be super fast. I pulled up and there were two cars in front of me. The Starbucks employee had me wait at the ordering screen. When they came back to take my order, I told them I was there to pick up my online order. They told me to pull up. I did and was handed the two green teas. I was told one more was coming... Then the drive through worker disappeared. Two other workers were inside.. neither came to see what I was missing. They kept looking in my direction but did not come over. They were talking about their tips and were even taking the money out of their envelopes. Then they disappeared as well. I was ready to get out of my car and make the mocha myself. After about 5 minutes the first employee finally came back and handed me the mocha THAT HAD BEEN SITTING AT THE PICK-UP COUNTER INSIDE THE STORE THE WHOLE TIME! I worked at a Starbucks for over a year. First of all, we never left a customer at the window unless we were short staffed and had to both make the drink and take orders and money. Two, you don't touch money and such unless you are not handling drinks and food. Money is dirty and they are making people's drinks. This violates health code. I was very disappointed in the customer service and lack of professionalism at this location.
Safeway~4~May 12, 2014~I don't understand why it's necessary to have 2 Starbucks coffees directly across the street from each other. UNTIL I went to the drive thru on 7th right next to my apartment and they had RUN OUT OF COFFEE. How is this possible? It's an effing coffee shop. Anyways, I came to this place and they saved the day! It's not as clean as the other place on 7th, but they are a bit faster at making drinks.
Safeway~1~May 4, 2015~Bad service, bad frap, bad attitude. Sat right behind the window. Worker insisted I get out of my chair and walk around to pick up my drink. Couldn't use common sense to simply hand it to me since its in arm reaching distance. Work on common sense service.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Jan 18, 2024~there food is good the service is good and the ambiance is pretty chill. 4 stars  i do reccomend
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Nov 24, 2024~The employees were extremely rude and disrespectful, no reason for them to be acting like that. Also I had to wait almost 20 minutes for one drink and there's no other customers here... I had to ask them TWICE to please just make my drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Feb 23, 2023~Will do in a pinch  The service at Starbucks is really pretty quick even though the lines are long.   This is not my normal Starbucks, however my coffee was made exactly the way I ordered and taste good.in addition to coffee Starbucks offers delicious pastries and sandwiches  if you are craving  a quick snack. I usually grab a cake pop or 2 on the go for my nephewcand my self. Not my usual Starbucks but will do in a pinch.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Jul 31, 2023~One of the things I like about Starbucks is that they sell one of my favorite brands of cold pressed juice: Evolution Fresh. I got an Evo drink and a bacon gouda sandwich (which they make fresh) for $10.53. The food was pretty good. Unfortunately, the Evo juice is overpriced. They only have the 11 oz bottles which they sell for $5 but you can easily buy a 15oz for around $4 instead. I guess you're paying more for the Starbucks atmosphere. The service itself was nothing special.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jul 17, 2024~Drinks and food looked ok, stood in line for 10 minutes while they took drive thru orders before me.  Workers showed anger towards me for just coming up to ask if my drink been called up yet.  I asked  one of them why are you all so angry because I'm getting my drink?  They said because we were over loaded on making orders.  I get it but don't take it out on customers who do have patience and not complaining.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Dec 9, 2023~I ordered a Grande Hot White Chocolate and it was filled a little over half the cup. What the actual fuck Starbucks. This used to be my favorite spot but lately, this location has been slacking.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jul 5, 2022~Starbucks if my life line. When I'm not sitting in the drive thru getting a handcrafted drink, I'm at home brewing it for myself. Today I came to a different location because they had a cold tumbler I was looking for. Got nervous for a min because they couldn't find it, but they did! And, I'm in love. I love starbucks and they have great merch. The cups keep your drinks hot or cold depending on your preference. I got the matte stainless steel cup and love it. Today, I decided to try a toasted vanilla oatmilk shaken Espresso and boyyy was it good! I got one less pump because I don't like it too sweet and it was perfect.  The toasty almond flavor is just perfect and pairs great with oatmilk. I'm lactose intolerant and I'm so glad that starbucks has more than just soy!The staff was friendly and helpful finding my cup!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Dec 29, 2021~Starbucks with a great staff that's fast, courteous and friendly. Derek, Kip and other staff are top ten in Phoenix. The location is very convenient at 19th Ave and Thunderbird.The hours are also longer(closes at 9pm)than most Starbucks in the area.Top ten Phoenix Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 9, 2024~Sooo, first I'm walking up to the door and the girl working locks it in front of me. I then get back in a 30k vehicle to go thru the drive thru -only for thee biggest franchise on the planet to tell me they couldn't give me change for a $20 bill?! Yeah, it's 6:30pm on a Friday night! Male and female working 2/9/24 -what a freakin joke! Horrible horrible serivice!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Dec 19, 2023~Doors are locked at 4:23pm on a Tuesday. This is the second time they have had locked doors during supposed business hours with no notice or sign.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Sep 11, 2023~Once again I decide to give this place another try since it's very close to my home.  And once again I was disappointed.   I ordered egg bites and a coffee drink.  The egg bites were good but the coffee had a horrible burnt plastic taste which seems to be the norm here.  For a place that supposedly specializes in coffee they definitely have dropped the ball.   Coffee is undrinkable and will be going straight into the trash.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Mar 24, 2023~The past three times I picked up coffee here it has been burnt and does not taste good.  And then this morning I tried again and my coffee was not only burnt but had a burnt plastic taste to it as well.  Undrinkable!!  The employees do not care about the quality of the product they put out.  Do better Starbucks!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Aug 15, 2023~This is the 2nd time I try to go inside the store to pick up my order and it's closed...Not sure why they are closing the inside at 7pm when they are supposed to be open until 9pm.  Ridiculous
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Oct 2, 2023~Great location on the way to major highway and by a high school which may be a problem during the school year? No line at 7:45 in the morning which was odd but this location is quick! Oatmeal was dry but I just added a little milk. Coffee was made perfectly.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Jul 25, 2023~Great location on the way to major highway and by a high school which may be a problem during the school year? No line at 7:45 in the morning which was odd but this location is quick! Oatmeal was dry but I just added a little milk. Coffee was made perfectly.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Jun 21, 2023~Short on time so drove through here for a quick bite.  It would have been nice if they weren't out of the first 3 items I tried to order.  Honestly...stock up people.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~May 21, 2021~Starbucks is what you expect.This place had full staff but all the outside tables were filthy while staff was just talking inside.Not the best location as transients come and sit around and leave there trash outside,maybe that's why they really don't want to go outside and clean...oh well what do you do?
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jan 13, 2024~When I received my order, I was disappointed. I ordered a cinnamon caramel cream cold brew. When It was delivered, I was sad to find out that my drink was made incorrectly. My drink included of only cold brew. My receipt states the order that I paid for but on the drink it says that I didn't order any cold foam. I was refunded a small portion of what I paid. I believe I should receive a full refund given that I did not receive the drink that I paid for.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 11, 2023~Workers dancing behind counter instead of helping customers. Had them remake my coffee 3 times because their `"coffee was watery and they didnt know why.`"Unbelievable
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Oct 18, 2022~I am done with Starbucks.  It used to be amazing and now it's bitter and half foam.  I ordered a venti cappuccino and it would have blown away in the wind if there was one, it was so light.  The brew was so bitter and hard to find since the foam made up at least half of the contents of the cup!  I used the drive thru window and was served in a sufficient amount of time by an adequate server so I'm not criticizing the employees.  It's the product that is unacceptable.    The product was not worth it at all.  I don't mind spending  more on a quality coffee served by friendly employees but spending 'over the top' money on bitter coffee in a half full container is just wrong.  Bye Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Oct 28, 2020~Great Starbucks with a great staff. They are doing a great job social distancing. Only a few people here, all hanging outside even though the inside is open. A tall hazelnut coffee was the perfect cup of coffee on a cold 70 degree day. Docking a star because they didn't have `"sugar free`" hazelnut.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 30, 2023~I put an order on the mobile app and selected in store pickup. When I got there the store was, once again, arbitrarily closed, with a sign that you had to use the drive thru. The drive thru was packed and I did not have time to sit in the line, so I had to leave without my coffee. I have called five times in the past ten minutes to cancel the order and request a refund, but no one will answer, so I guess I'm just out $8. Ridiculous. If you randomly close the store, you need to turn off in-store pickup, and you need to have phone lines open so people can cancel if they don't have time to sit in the drive thru line. That's the whole reason I order in the app in the first place.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Mar 7, 2023~For no reason the inside seating is closed, making it inconvenient for me to order, and instead having to order within the app when I don't want to. Other wise the food is good.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 24, 2023~Didn't even end up getting our drinks, just decided to drive right through. Whatever person they had working feb 24, 2023 at 8pm was nothing but rude, sarcastic, and just all around irritating when i was extremely nice and understanding. don't tell me you can't do something when the store i work at does it and so does every other store i've gone to. you're just being lazy and thought you were funny when you made your smart comment. disappointing
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~May 17, 2019~Convenient location. Ok service. Needs a good cleaning inside and out! With the abundance of high school kids here they really need to be diligent. Outside trash everywhere. Tables need cleaning. Inside I noticed the glass surrounding the counter was dirty and they hadn't swept in awhile.Last time I was in I asked them to come clean the outside. They responded they would but never did. Windows are dirty. I've been here several times and it never seems to get better.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Mar 3, 2022~I'm just sort of sick of Starbucks. Why can't they have more drinks on the menu that don't have gobs of caffeine in them but isnt herbal tea? (Snore) Are they trying to create drug addictions? But i digress....I like the pink drink but it has even more caffeine in it than coffee does. So in the middle of the day if you want to sleep that night, you have to drink tea or some fattening heart attack crap if you want to get a nice drink to chill.  Stupid. And honestly I think the coffee is pretty bitter even if I get the blonde roast.  I know they are a coffee shop but they have expanded themselves well beyond coffee. I'm just surprised they have not come up with more and better and original drinks by now that don't have tons of calories or gobs of caffeine that isn't tea.  And the food looks fake and overly processed.  But any teenager I've ever offered to buy food for there, suddenly gets these wide bugged out excited eyes. So there must be something in the food that attracts teenagers. Starbucks is old news. They don't even treat people well anymore. And for a 5 dollar coffee, I wouldn't mind a little fun design on the top of my cappuccino like other coffee shops do. When they first opened up-amazing. Now,  I think they are on their way out or at least down, unless they can get each younger generation hooked on caffeine and plastic food. Their stock price also shows they aren't rocking it anymore. The only time it really goes up is the pumpkin spice latte release each year. Talk about GROSS sugar overload. Ugh. I wish they would do something different. I'm tired sooooo of Starbucks. Meh.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~May 18, 2023~I think it is so weird that they ask for tips through the drive-through! I am not a cheap person I am very generous with waitresses bartenders I tip my nail people, my hair people, etc. but the audacity to hound me for a tip when I've been waiting in the drive-through for 20 minutes is ridiculous. This review is not for the employees. This is for the company starbucks the billion dollar company that instead of paying their employees more they hound their customers for tips through the drive-through. That's crazy to me. I am paying cash from now on because it's so awkward !!! I have $10 to pay for my coffee &amp; sandwich in the morning. I wish I had more but I don't. I'm sorry! Starbucks should be paying you guys more truly there so greedy it's not even funny! I'm gonna buy an espresso machine. I would understand if this was a mom and pops coffee shop but it's not. It's a billion $ worldwide company come on Starbucks do better and this is not for the employees. This is for the company.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Apr 27, 2022~The girl at the drive-thru window right now was so unbelievably rude!!!!! I never had an experience like that at Starbucks lol another girl had to take her place! She was so mean like!!! I can't believe with my 7 dollar coffee I got a side of bitter attitude and misery! It's not my fault if you work here and you're mad AF don't blame me blame the Billion dollar CEOs at Starbucks! I mean there's one on every corner I'll go to another one but seriously check your attitude! I was very cordial because I could've been a B back!!! I could've said something hilarious but I didn't i just got my expensive coffee and went about my business !!!!!!!!! The craziest part is I never had that experience at that Starbucks everybody's usually very nice not this girl tho!!!! Take your bitterness to Dunkin' Donuts.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jul 9, 2021~Great place, great workers. Macy works there and is great.Got my Strawberry Lemonade Smoothie.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Apr 30, 2023~They recently removed all outdoor furniture from their patio without notice. Jokes on us because we thought it would be fun to walk our dog here on a weekend morning to spend some quality time outside but we're told by an employee that they had `"got rid of it`". Kind of a bummer
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jan 6, 2021~`"This Starbucks is amazing I get the best customer satisfaction`" said nobody at this establishment.Every time I get to order from here I usually get my Frappuccino and always come across rude workers with attitude and today I got a feisty one.. I wanted the manager to talk to about the rudeness from the employer but turns out she was the manager.. I mean now that I realize why the other workers have an attitude is because `"Manager`" gives off, Shade and the workers think it's okay to rude too.. I mean set an example for not only yourself but for the workers that look up too you..  I was refused service, told her I ordered the Frappuccino minus the attitude and kindly told `"Sam`" the manager to change her attitude and I wasn't done ordering also but it was a scenic detour around the building to get nothing but attitude although that was the only the I didn't have to pay for..Come to this building for a nice detour and a nice fresh attitude from the manager and the workers.. ask for a free sample of sass and definitely they'll deliver, Guaranteed!! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Oct 11, 2019~I got the peeeerrrfect drink from this location! They were so polite! I ordered a drink from the Starbucks `" secret menu `" and they were so polite. She even asked me which straw I prefer in my beverage. Baristas like the ones at Starbucks make your day just a little sweeter. i came into the store to order the dragon drink and on the menu it says comes with coconut milk. She's asks if i want lemonade with that.... i was confused because I've never been asked that. I get a drink that has noooooo coconut milk and she tells me oh that's the violet drink ... i said there's no `" violet drink `" on your menu she insisted i and the menu were incorrect. My mom ordered ice tea with a spare tea bag when getting the receipt and waiting for drinks she was charged a whole 5 dollar beverage instead of 20 cents for a tea bag.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 25, 2019~Starbucks...Didnt you all just shut down for a day of cultural sensitivity training. This location should consider making sure the redhead employee that happens to be training the new woman Bree (that works the register) for success and not failure. Bree was assisting each customer in the manner I believe starbucks wants, she was always doing her best to offer great service to each customer... meanwhile the read head with the tattoos other arm, and tattered black tshirt leaned over the coffee machines and register for the togo window just laughing and chatting with another employee who was supposed to be making drinks that Bree was ringing in...I believe her name is Adele.  After about 20 min passing and watching this multiple times, I went to the pick up window and she walked by me ignoring me. I then waited in line again while brie did her best to help every customer, while the red head and another employee just chatted...once bree was able to assist me I let her know i hadn't received my drink, she told the redhead head and she proceeded to figure out what I ordered.. about 10 min later she provided me with something, lol. and proceeded back to talking. shortly after a tall gentleman in a yellow shirt went to the pick up counter to remind the staff he was also forgotten. This staff needs management or management training but the lack their of is a CANCER to your location.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jul 23, 2017~I got the peeeerrrfect drink from this location! They were so polite! I ordered a drink from the Starbucks `" secret menu `" and they were so polite. She even asked me which straw I prefer in my beverage. Baristas like the ones at Starbucks make your day just a little sweeter.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Sep 2, 2017~I stopped by the location yesterday and it was so chill. The employee had my mobile order ready and didn't have a problem with me adding a last minute item to my order (mmmm pumpkin loaf). I found out that they do a `"Customer of the Month`" event there and I thought that was a cool way to thank your customers for their loyalty. Also, very cool that when I got my treat, they had actually drawn some art on my treat bag. A little bee and it said `"Bee Happy.`" Two thumbs up for this location!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Feb 4, 2021~Nice Starbucks. Very clean inside and one hundred percent covid-19 safety compliant.bathrooms were open and clean. Service was fast and friendly. Coffee tasted good. Nice small outdoor dining area with overhead awnings to block the sun.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Nov 11, 2022~This Starbucks is literally across the street from me. What a Convenience! NOT!! The employees here are so very rude. I spend too much money with Starbucks to be treated so terribly. I wish I knew the early morning barista name, she's the problem. So now I have to drive to a further location just to get coffee because this location can't get together. And the coffee is horrible on top of it.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Oct 23, 2022~Had a distasteful experience this morning of October 23rd around 9am. Went into pick up order and they claimed they didn't have it. And told me to wait 5 minutes. So I did. Only after ten minutes finding out they didn't even start the order. The supervisor had an attitude and told me to wait another ten minutes. I had to leave before we started arguing. She was very disrespectful and seemed as she didn't want to be there. Seemed lazy with a bad attitude. Didn't appreciate it and I recommended peopoe not go ti this location. Managers I doubt will do anything as the time we're in that type of behavior is ok
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 6, 2023~Didn't like an interaction I had with an employee. All I asked was a question about a type of coffee and it's correlation to the stars points system so I can take advantage of them properly as I was trying to save a buck getting my coffee before school. Then James at the drive thru said he didn't know what I was talking about. I understood but still felt like I had to rush to pick a random menu item so I just got water since I wanted to move out of everyone's way and just decided to direct my question to a manager or supervisor if at all possible. As I got to the window, James said there wasn't a manager nor supervisor available because they were between them right now. I asked a bit just in question because all I wanted to know was a simple coffee type. I felt like he was just giving me attitude and wasn't being helpful at all. He could've asked his employees if they knew or something.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jun 4, 2022~I understand that people are doing their best during Covid but every time I come to this Starbucks my drink literally taste like they haven't cleaned the espresso machine. And every other drink I purchased it is just not up to Starbucks standards. I literally live down the street from the Starbucks and I drive all the way to Bell to go to Starbucks because this one is so disgusting. I've given this Starbucks chance after chance to just improve and every time it's a big fail like I think I've had to return my drink three or four times!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Sep 14, 2021~Had a mobile order for my mom, I got the drink and don't know why the lady asked me to tell her what the other item was when they have the mobile order and all the items she order, it was as if she was testing me. Come her often, the Long lines usually take forever, usually are always out of something.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Sep 11, 2022~I usually don't have a problem with this Starbucks, I would rate it a 5 usually but this morning I came and Tonya took my order she was very rude. One of my drinks was made wrong and I politely told her she said nothing and was super impolite.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Nov 7, 2021~Let me get something straight, In-N-Out has done more in 48 months than Starbucks has done in 48 years! This dang place has super over priced drinks and they aren't even good! It is all just sugar!! Let's go Brandon!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Apr 9, 2021~Service is usually pretty good but they are always out of breakfast burritos it's off a busy road so it's hard to study or do work outside. If you like to people watch then that's the spot.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Nov 21, 2017~I would give this Starbucks 10 stars if I could! Ordered from mobile app today and it defaulted to the new 7th &amp; TBird location (completely my fault  ) So my poor BF who is picking it up, is now standing in there very confused. I called and spoke with Dani, she was so incredibly helpful and understanding, not only did she get my order ready right away, she explained this situation happens often,which made me feel much less dumb  This is the greatest Starbucks I've ever been to, the employees are always thoughtful and friendly, the building is clean and charming and my drink is perfect every time!!! This location deserves some recoginition for sure
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Dec 3, 2019~I regret coming here every time I do. It's the one closet to my house so it's where I have ended up while I was sick this past week. The people that work here are beyond rude. The last time I came in the guy sat my drinks next to the window and continued to make the cars that were behind me their drinks. Didn't even take my payment. I was about to drive off when he finally opened the window. Didn't say hi or even the amount I owed. Just scanned my phone and handed my drinks over. This isn't the first time.  My husband got a hot chocolate from there the other day and a it wasn't filled to the top. I get that there was whipped cream on the top but a good two inches of whipped cream that melted into the drink before he even got to it? Really? Don't waste your time or money at this location. The people at 7th st and thunderbird are MUCH nicer.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 18, 2020~Tonight went to Starbucks and had asked for 2 separate orders at 8:18pm and had to repeat my order 4 times and the lady at drive thru was giving attitude the whole time and had repeated my order over and over and every single time it was not correct then when she got it correct we went to the window and still didn't have it correct and had got attitude that we had said something and had the person that was paying for the second order pay for one of my drinks and didn't want to change it for me to pay! I never had to deal with someone so rude and disrespectful at Starbucks ever and this is my first time ever going to this Starbucks and will not be coming back to this Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jun 30, 2018~Worst Starbucks. They never get my order right and take too long to get any orders ready.  I went and try to get my order right they never gave me my order right, they just gave me a free drink. I never going back to this place.   I ask for 2 caramel with extra coffee, not  2 caramel with frapp Chips.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Apr 21, 2019~Worst Starbucks experience I've ever had. I made a mobile order so that I could get my coffee and bagel quicker before work. I stood in this Starbucks for 17 min waiting before deciding to ask about my order. Everyone was ignoring me where as if I go into any other Starbucks they typically greet you and ask if you needed something if you've been standing there for a while. I asked the lady taking orders if she's seen my mobile order because it had been almost 20 minutes. She went and checked and they had made my drink wrong but no bagel yet. So they finally made the bagel and remade the drink. The drink was still wrong and the girl just tossed the bagels my direction. No kind words or customer service. Disappointed and now am late for work. Probably won't go to this location ever again because 4-8 minutes of waiting turned into 25.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Dec 23, 2019~Faith is an amazing worker.  She was quick to help me out when I was in a rush and was so nice! She makes my day better.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Sep 24, 2019~The workers are very nice and it is overall awesome, it gets crowded at 3:30 when the kids from the high school nearby get out, but it clears out in about 30ish minutes
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Oct 19, 2015~PREDICTION: won't be there long- I've been inside twice in 3 weeks-FILTHY!!If you're a drive thru person I guess you're ok, seems like that's the only focus. Met a friend inside on 2 occasions, we ordered the flavored soda- about 4-5 customers after us got their hot beverages well before we got anything, both times. And both times we were asked what we were still waiting for. Um, yeah...those $5 sodas?? Oh! We'll get right to that. At least 6 ppl behind counter during each hour long visit- nobody seems to care that the tables and chairs are all askew, filthy- all kinds of wrappers and trash on the floor. There were 3 separate customers who were all alone, taking up the `"4-top`" tables w/laptops, leaving us the only halfway clean high top table in the corner-beside a trash can -- we asked for something to clean it off &amp; were told that the `"napkins were by the door`"-also telling them that all of the tables were dirty &amp; sticky. But why would they come out from behind the counter to check the front of house when in all of the time we were there they didn't wipe the 'pick-up' counter??? It was freaking gross, and to neglect it even after being told, are you kidding me?? I saw one employee go on break, walked to door and back- didn't bother to take any kind of ownership by straightening the chairs, taking a look around to check cleanliness...this Starbucks is in my neighborhood, I was hoping that it would be good to get that kind of biz to help build the area a bit- I'm not so hopeful anymore. I gave this place 2 tries. My friend came from Glendale and she's told me that she'll never go to this location again because of what I said in this review. Very sad. I don't know who trains the staff, clearly there was no focus on the comfort or concern of the inside patrons. There should be a sign posted that a 4-top cannot be occupied by a single person too-especially when there are a few ppl taking up that space singly. (No place to put handbag on those tiny high top tables, the area is still kind of dicey, no chance you could safely place your handbag on the chairback out of your sight) SHAPE-UP, STARBUCKS, or like the many failed businesses in that space before you, you will FAIL!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Feb 16, 2020~Walk in to this place today. I had a slight limp because of blisters. The floor was soft but no one asked me how I was hurt. I ordered an identical ice coffee as my friend who had an invisible sling on his arm. Not sure how he felt emotionally but I was sad. I became happy when after 6 minutes both our drinks came out at the same time. I felt really nice but he must have felt like some fucking idiotic slab of shit.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Apr 24, 2016~Coffee great!Staff great!Atmosphere great!Cleanliness??? Overall seems ok, but the floors - especially ladies room - the WORST I've actually ever seen! Looked like a pack of wolves came through and bedded there for the night! Took a better look at floor in seating area and they looked pretty dirty as well.Come on, Starbucks! This is am eating/drinking establishment, and now I see I'm not the first review on Yelp to mention this problem!My advice; stay in your clean car, use the drive through, and wait till you get to work to use a bathroom! Can only imagine what the men's might look like?! Ugh!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Mar 30, 2019~Super nice and clean. Plenty of parking. I sure like those new cloud macchiatos. Just wish it wasn't $6 a day for coffee :/
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jan 24, 2018~come here like 4 times a month to get either my green tea soy latte with 4 pumps classic or my green tea frappe with caramel drizzle and java chips or passion tea lemonade with 8 pumps classic and a splash of apple juice and they are always happy and friendly in the drive thru and fast service
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Apr 29, 2018~This Starbucks has some consistently nice people and consistently good service.  After having to move during spring break and not having internet-They saved my semester!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Sep 16, 2020~Horrible. Half of the time when you come to this location they aren't open despite it being early in the afternoon. When they are open, expect to wait in line for at least 20 minutes.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 30, 2017~This location is very inconsistent. They've been unfriendly, slow, and mess my order up far too often.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 5, 2020~You know, I live by this Starbucks and come quite often out of convenience. I constantly defend it to my mom who abhors it. However, I'm over it. I'm over the rude baristas, I'm over the drinks CONSTANTLY being wrong or 75% ice.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Nov 3, 2016~I always go to this Starbucks and they always make my drinks perfect. Sometimes, i go here to study and they are accommodating and generous. Love the mobile app!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jun 4, 2016~Dani is awesome at this location kisses to her She rocks !! I will appreciate her! There is no one like her!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jan 16, 2016~Love this location when I come from Cali it's down the street to where I stay!the crew is awesome here!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Mar 17, 2017~Whenever, I came to the drive-thru at this location, Sarah is always very friendly.  She listens to how I wound like my drink is cause I have some food allergies and she is excellent with her customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Nov 23, 2019~I'm tired of paying money everyday to always have something wrong with my drink. For god sakes can't people read. And most of them need to go back for training on how to make an iced caramel macchiato. Very frustrating.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Sep 23, 2016~Probably the worst and slowest Starbucks I've ever been to. They should take some tips from Dutch bros. on how quality and speedy service looks like. Manbun guy was slow and didn't complete my order.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~May 2, 2017~I usually don't want to say bad things about a company but this Starbucks location irritates me. I spend a pretty decent amount of money on Starbucks a week. I go to this location cause it's close to home and the staff is amazing. However they consistently get my very basic drink wrong. Either the size is incorrect or it's not shaken like their menu suggests when ordering tea. It may not seem like it matters but being a person that orders two to three green teas daily I can tell you it does effect the taste. I really hope they stop cutting corners for the sake of being faster and make the drinks the way they are suppose to be.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Aug 18, 2019~Worts Starbucks from Az  i bet the girl at the window was having a really bad day, she was rude and had an angry look.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Nov 22, 2019~Wow, I love Starbucks.. but who didn't know that! So I have been going a lot more lately and it always nice being welcomed in with a cheery smile, and a warm hello!! And what's ever better is the new man who works there (Jordan) was really helpful yesterday explaining to me how I can redeem my star points!! So that was extremely appreciated
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Jan 8, 2016~Starbucks is starbucks...employees are friendly and my coffee was good. I always order the Peppermint Mocha when it's in season. The drive-thru is pretty quick. Overall good service every time I go.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~May 31, 2019~I'm from out of town so this was my very first time but they were all WONDERFUL. Jordan, Lena, etc were so wonderful and sweet and funny and the service was perfect. I had to wait a little bit for my sandwich but that was like, not even a big thing. Their customer service is great and I'm sad I'm leaving soon because I'd be in here all the time.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 1, 2018~Thank you Starbucks!?!? Not only did you make my daughter late for school, you also made me late for a doctors appt! Once a week we go there as a treat and today was no treat.  After waiting 20 minutes in the lobby and watching the drive thru cycle through several times, (I went inside so I wasn't one of those idling cars) I asked how much longer for my mocha frap and a white chocolate mocha.  Your response was the same as McDonald's with their milkshakes.  `"Sorry the machine was broken`" and just then one of you pulled a sticker for my drink and asked me what it was, well at that time I couldn't wait, so I said just give me a regular cup of coffee and I'll split the difference with your review, so here we are, debt paid, and now I need to look for a new place to treat ourselves once a week!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Nov 16, 2016~11/16 Wednesday night at 6:55pm. Workers are not very friendly. Wifi is horrible and the response I got from the barista was `"we are by a mountain, so it's gonna be slow`" she did not care at all. In fact, she answered me and then walked away as if I wasn't worth her time. Mind you, I had to wait for her to finish talking to her friend at the long table near the register before she would answer my question. The wifi won't even allow me to upload a document to my drop box, that's how horrible it is. Clearly customer service isn't valued at this Starbucks. Very disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Oct 18, 2015~This one's brand new and I've only experienced the drive thru but that was pretty much the best part. It was like a video conference when I was ordering which took me by surprise! But it was outstanding service and the building looks solid. I will have to go inside next time.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jul 20, 2016~Always has great customer service and I haven't had any problems with my orders at this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Jul 16, 2016~Nice Starbucks. Nice staff. Not a lot of hipsters. I really hate writing these stupid reviews. Are we done yet????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? God help me.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jan 30, 2019~First time visiting this location and I was very impressed by the staff and the outstanding customer service we received! My mom and I are Starbucks fans we love to try new drinks but today we wanted something nice and hot due to the cold weather outside. Vanessa was extremely sweet helping us out with ordering the right cup of coffee for my mom. And my peppermint white mocha was excellent! The store was under a rush yet both Vanessa  and John were extremely professional, nice and always with a smile on their faces! Not only with my mom and I but all the customers. Thank you guys for everything ! Oh almost forgot and the spelling to my name was correct ! Made it even better !!!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jun 26, 2016~I love this Starbucks. I usually do drive through on my way to class or work and they sure are fast, friendly and efficient.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Feb 7, 2018~I never thought that I would care enough to leave a review for such a big chain like Starbucks. But I come from Seattle and I have never received such excellent quality and personable service in my life! The employees here always so cheerful, helpful and energetic. I have never been to Starbucks with baristas that are ON THEIR A GAME, quite like this team. I've only been here twice since I moved in down the street, and it pains me that I can't remember the two names of the people who brought me to write this review. But I certainly hope to see them again soon. Way to go!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jul 30, 2016~Slowest Starbucks drive thru I have EVER been in. And I've been in ones that are far busier. This one is extremely slow; doesn't matter how many cars are in it.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Apr 26, 2016~Baristas are good at making drinks and remembering the regulars! They try to make everyone's experience pleasant and connect with every customer. Busy in the mornings before work and when the high school lets out! Spacious lobby and patio for hanging out. Large table for groups or meetings. Special clover machine (reverse French press) for delicious fresh cups of coffee made to order! Large selection of small-lot reserve coffee. Free coffee tastings every Thursday!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Apr 17, 2016~Baristas are good at making drinks and remembering the regulars! They try to make everyone's experience pleasant and connect with every customer. Busy in the mornings before work and when the high school lets out! Spacious lobby that is cute and clean. Large outdoor patio with misters during the heat for hanging out. Special clover machine for delicious fresh cups of coffee! Free coffee tastings every Thursday!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~May 13, 2016~This has nothing to do with the coffee (it's okay) and everything to do with the HORRIBLE parking lot and drive through!  I stopped at the drive through at 7:20 and didn't manage to get out of the parking lot until 7:45.  Needless to say, I was within minutes of being late to usher my students into the classroom and getting a ding on my review - all for a cup of coffee!  I literally could not get out of the parking lot because by then the drive through was backed up in two directions.  People were honking and yelling because they couldn't get out of their parking space.  I will never darken the door of this Starbucks again!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Dec 11, 2015~Since I moved to Arizona I have not found a Starbucks that I really liked coming from Portland there's a Starbucks on every corner, and they are fast. This is by far the best Starbucks but I've been to in Arizona everything is always babe great.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Mar 2, 2016~I live so close to this location and i love that they carry the reserve blends.  I came through the drive thru sick and explained i couldn't have my usual and the barista suggested that i try the peach green tea lemonade drink,  thats now my favorite drink. Thanks for the great suggestions.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Oct 9, 2015~Stopped by this new location for the first time today, and was pleased with the service! I used the drive through, and got my drink quickly. The cashier was very friendly and we had a nice conversation about my dog, who was in the car with me. I'm not often near this Starbucks, but I will definitely stop in again the next time I have a chance.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Nov 3, 2015~Now I haven't been inside the store but I have used the drive-thru three different times and I have to say I really like it!  Three stars are for the fact that this location took over the empty lot but I found the staff to be friendly and quick.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~May 26, 2016~This was one of the worst Starbucks experiences I have ever had. I ordered a green iced tea, unsweetened. Not a hard drink to make. There were two gentlemen in front of me who ordered a black iced tea, and a mocha frappaccino light. Also not hard drinks. The man behind me got his cappuccino before any of our drinks were even made! Then, the woman making drinks only made one at a time. As a former Starbucks barista, I know there is a system in place so two drinks are being made at the same time. That means I had to wait even longer for a drink that take 10 seconds to make. After the gentlemen in front of me got their drinks, the barista looked at my cup, then grabbed one from another customer that had also ordered after me (and the one who got the cappuccino) and started making their drink. After their drink was finished, the barista deigned to make mine. On top of all of this, she was not wearing an apron, which violates all kinds of health codes. I am extremely unhappy with my service here. If you want care and attention, don't go to this Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jan 7, 2016~We came to this Starbucks during a recent road trip. Alyssa went above &amp; beyond in customer service! She made sure that our drinks were made to perfection. We couldn't be happier with how everything went and the drinks were delicious. :)
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jun 12, 2016~2nd time this has happened to me here, I was waiting for my coffee for almost 20 minutes watching people that were behind me getting their drinks, but I don't want to be impatient, maybe those drinks are made faster than mine, I have no idea the time to make coffee, but I go up and stand where they hand out the drinks as the lady is bringing two or three more drinks over completely ignores us until I have to say excuse me a few times and told them I've been waiting on a venti double shot, and she said `"oh next time just tell us your here, you had a mobile order`" I'm no I've been sitting here for 15 minutes and standing here waiting for one of you to acknowledge me for another 5 minutes and I ordered and paid with that cashier who has also been watching me sit here and didn't say anything, then after 20 minutes of my drinking sitting they didn't even make me a new one she slides it in front of me and says `"it's right there`" well now it is
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 26, 2024~I just moved to the area and this Starbucks had the QUICKEST drive-thru line I've ever experienced at a Starbucks. I pre-planned 20 extra minutes for the visit but no need! Thank you for a great and fast start to my day
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Sep 9, 2024~Basically just getting ice from Starbucks at this point. Every time I go they fill the ice to the absolute brim. I can't imagine the employees do this willingly the management at Starbucks must be telling them to do this. Disappointing when coffee already costs $8.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 31, 2021~Bucks extremely well located for drive thru about a block North of Bell Ave on the right hand side of N. 7th st going North. When I walked in I was very impressed with the cleanliness. This maybe the cleanest Bucks I've been to anywhere.The shift manager, Adeeb, is an outstanding guy. I enjoyed talking to him and his customer service skills are A plus. I'm impressed with all the Starbucks stepping up the CS...competitors aren't close.The inside is on the small side but I am rating 5 stars for the staff quality and location, cleanliness.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Sep 19, 2020~They are super nice but very slow at taking orders. The line was pretty long. My drink was super sweet.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Dec 1, 2022~So I can see why the average is 3 stars the staff is friendly and work hard but I stopped in the day before to order coffee for my work and offered to pay for it that day the manager said no will have to be next day in the morning and wrote it down in a calendar. When I come I the staff had no knowledge of my order. They were helpful and worked hard to get my order but very poor communication between shifts will have to travel a little farther and get from Dunkin' next time.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jul 14, 2022~This used to be a good Starbucks. Fast drive thru.  Pleasant staff. Last two times I went there was no one I recognized. The Chai Tea Latte was white water. It didn't taste anything like it should. I'm not comfortable complaining and I thought this would be a one time mistake. Today was the same. The lid wasn't on. I went to taste my Oatmilk brown sugar espresso and it dumped all over me. The  barista said I'd squeezed the cup too hard. What??It tasted the same exactly the same as yesterday's Chai. I did ask them to remake it. Not any better. It didn't even look like they usually do. I won't be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Sep 22, 2023~Aylin was so nice, and considerate espically me acting like a Karen in the drive thru lol. Thank you for making my coffee with what you had going on!  :)
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Jun 11, 2020~I'm not sure if Starbucks recently did more training or what, because the last few times I've been the drinks have been way better. The service has even gotten better. The prices are still a bit too high for what you get, but hey we all love our caffeine so its worth it. This trip was good. Me and my fam got four drinks and they all came out perfect which is usually rare for Starbucks. I usually get iced coffee, but have been on a caramel macchiato with almond milk kick, and it was prepared perfectly. I used to work for starbucks back in the day, and the drink I had was exactly how its supposed to be. Thanks for stepping up the game Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Feb 3, 2023~This Starbucks is very concerning. I had to go inside due to a bee issue in the drive through. No biggie. Ordered and waited 15 minutes for a pink drink... while waiting, noticed that there was a swarm of bees by the door.. advised a barista to which I was greeted with a chuckle and then she turned away while giving me an eye roll. As someone who is deathly allergic to bees, this is very concerning. The store should be closed when these issues arise. I know I'm not the only one who is allergic. Not to mention just how unsanitary that is.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Nov 14, 2021~Usually we have nice service and usually don't have any issues with our orders but today was completely different. I got a iced venti chai tea and my cup was so full of ice I couldn't even stir it around, which we know that means more ice, less drink and if I'm paying $7 I'd rather not get jipped and my husband got a grande peppermint mocha and it wasn't even filled 3/4 of the way
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Nov 3, 2018~It's Frustrating when you frequent a place a few times and Every-time it's Wrong!! First time through the drive thru- My order was apparently knocked out order...so they started handing me a bunch of stuff that wasn't mine. Then I have to Flag her down at the window to let her know it's all Wrong. They give me a card for Freebie next time but I pulled off and they drink they gave me was Still Wrong!!! Argh!! Today, same deal...The staff there seems to be Sleep Walking and not concerned at All about Service. The New guy at the register kept saying he didn't know what he was doing!! Not very encouraging for confidence in the product in the cup...and it was Wrong!! Sigh!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Apr 29, 2018~This is light iced matcha  green tea latteI think not!!!!Extra ice to me!!!So disappointed
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Oct 17, 2019~Today for lunch I needed a coffee pick me up and decided to post mate some Starbucks.  First they ran out of the sandwich that I wanted so the lady called and I told her a grilled cheese would be fine.  It was gross!!!!! Second I ordered the dream bar.  They charged me $3.45 and the package actually says 2.50!!! See pics!! On the plus side, my iced coffee was good.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 14, 2021~I ordered a venti caramel frappachino with a shit ton of caramel and The barista named Kasey who's usually there around 6pm was making it and when we pulled up to the window she said to tell me when to stop adding caramel she is awesome!! Thank you!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jul 9, 2021~Because of the awesome baristas &amp; the outstanding service they provide is why boyfriend and i always have and always will go to this Starbucks location. Keep up the good works guys
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jul 9, 2021~You know it's extremely sad when you try and give places just one more chance and they just ruin it again for you. I ordered a venti iced white mocha with vanilla sweet cream cold foam, and it seemed like the people were new because they weren't understanding what that was. I go to the window and my drink has a sad excuse of whipped cream on it, I said it's supposed to be sweet cream cold foam, she showed me the drink I wanted I said yes but venti, she said so with that it's gonna be $12 dollars, HA! I never payed more than $7 for that drink ANYWHERE and I get this drink every time, I'm not understanding why this location ALWAYS HAS AN ISSUE WITH MAKING DRINKS. they have no idea what they were doing as usual, it seems like they have new management and employees everyday... sounds a little scammy, maybe it's time to just shut it down lol. Sad.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Mar 24, 2021~Been coming here for YEARS ever since it opened. I usually like to switch up my drinks but this past couple of years I've gotten blonde vanilla lattes,I literally got it the other day... not even 48 hours and the girl tells me she can't make it because they don't have it, very strange since that's a super basic drink and been on the menu for years but ok, the guy, not sure of their names, was very sad and sounded miserable, every time I go. He doesn't greet you like everyone else does, he hands you the drink but you have to almost break your arm cause he doesn't wanna reach out and doesn't say anything!! At all even after saying thank you so awkward. this place needs to get it together, they lost a loyal customer. Sad.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~May 16, 2021~Currently here as we speak. It states that their hours of operation on Sunday is 5AM got here at 5:20 AM then the staff proceeded to tell me at 5:40 they're opening later! So I've been waiting around to just get my coffee for 20 minutes. Extremely unprofessional and highly upset that they just get to decided when to open when their hours of operation states otherwise. Pissed to say the least
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Mar 25, 2016~My husband and I went to this location of Starbucks on Thursday, March 24th in the morning. There was a line at the drive thru, however, we didn't have long to wait as the line moved quickly. We go to this location often and it is always a good experience. The employees are friendly and efficient. They like to engage the customer in conversation and they seem to genuinely care about the customer and like their job as barista's. Our cold coffee drinks were fantastic as usual. We love this location and will be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Feb 17, 2020~The service here was incredIbly slow. While we were waiting for our drinks we saw them fail to give the couple before us one of their drinks. When probed about that they really steuffled to even fill the order and instead of apologizing  they made an excuse about the printer not working. Now to our order - They made one drink iced instead of hot despite the sticker saying hot. They just didn't make our second drink. Instead of apologizing when probed they said they thought it was a mobile order. Not sure how it being a mobile order would have made that delay worth it. Meanwhile the confusion seemed to happen when my drink was handed off from one worker to another so the first could go on break. They made themselves drinks and left while my empty cup sat there. When my drink was made it was really quite bad. I got a refresher and it was extremely watered down. I've never seen  one so light! I wouldn't go back to this location. Luckily there are many other Starbucks right in the area.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 9, 2022~Very unhappy with this location. They did a good job in the past but recently things have changed i'm not sure what. But yesterday I placed a mobile order to pick up my coffee before I went into work. I got there by the time it said it would be done, and it wasn't done. I sat there and waited for it for five minutes which made me late to work and I never got my coffee because they still hadn't started it. So I tried again today and placed my mobile order even earlier to make sure I can get my coffee before work. And when I got there granted they are busier location however that's not an excuse for not having any of the prior mobile orders done. So again I had to wait for my drink and I was late for work because it wasn't ready when it was supposed to be. The workers are very friendly but if something doesn't change with how they run this location I definitely will not be coming back.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Apr 24, 2019~I'll make this right to the point.. Their mobile ordering sucks. I'll get there and they don't have the order ready... Their excuse every time `" the printer isn't working`".  I hear this EVERY week!!!  Why can't they get it fixed???!!! Be invested in making your customers happy and to help your location be more efficient. Be more proactive.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Oct 5, 2021~Ariel was an absolute joy this morning!! She was bubbly and welcoming. Such a great experience!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Feb 16, 2020~Very slow service and multiple missed and incorrect orders while we stood waiting for our drinks to come out. Half the staff made their own drinks and went on break while we waited and then we had to ask after our drinks since the remaining staff were only serving the drive through. The struggle was real it seemed.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~May 10, 2020~Mobile order and arrived. Sign says to please get your order by going through the drive-through. Drive-through line is around the store so makes no sense to have mobile orders as a convenience. 15 minutes later I make it up to an employee and I ask why do I need to wait in this line. She says you don't you can go inside and pick it up. But the sign says... Oh no the door is open just go inside and get it. I get inside and get my drink. I tell The next employee at the sign is directing us to get in line instead of come inside. He says yeah OK. I can tell by the look in his eye he doesn't give a rip so I respond you are not going to do anything are you. All you have to do is take down the sign. He says no I have to get back to work. I said it is an A-frame sign just pull it inside or you can even erase it or update it with your magic marker. No he says and have a good day. I managed a Starbucks in the 90s when customers mattered and service was a priority. This store is god awful
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jan 24, 2019~Best Starbucks location I have ever been to! All of the employees are friendly and helpful, they get my complicated order right every time!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Nov 8, 2020~Chris told me my card was declining so I paid cash, when I got home my card was charged 3 x... went back to get my money and he said he could only refund me for one (Chris) what a joke. World is full of crooks.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Apr 30, 2013~My drink always taste great, however that is what you are paying for consistency and price! Convenient to have a drive through, but never is it quick. If they could work on the time it took to be and in and out with your drink they'd probably receive better reviews.Ill re review if anything changes!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Sep 20, 2019~9/20/19 7AM visit: The white girl in drive-thru with the head wrap around her was rude and has no customer service skills! I don't know why she's handling drive-thru! Our order was not processed correctly and instead of handling it properly she gives an attitude and has the audacity to be condescending! However, the Supervisor was nice and very professional.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Dec 30, 2019~I frequent this store at least 3 times a week, I've gotten the same order every time since the holiday drinks came out. Last week and today I had the same girl take my order, repeat it back to me, and ring it in correctly on the screen (chestnut praline latte), both times I got to the window she obnoxiously lunged halfway out the window and exclaimed that they don't have the caramel brulee latte anymore, to which I tell her that's not even the drink I ordered, and someone has to come up and correct her. She even recognized that she's done that to someone before in which I had to break the news that it was me she did it to AGAIN. Not sure why or how this has happened twice considering she's repeated my order back to me and rang it in correctly the first time. Thinking maybe she doesn't belong in the drive thru.Every other time is a great experience, just very annoyed that this somehow has been a reoccurring thing.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Mar 22, 2021~Best starbucks location, I've been customer here for a year now and i used to get coffee 2-4 times a week. Never had a bad customer service and i never had a great irish cold brew anywhere else than here.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 22, 2018~Coby was such a pleasure to get assistance from. Very friendly and courteous. Plus very knowledgeable about the different beverages. Clean location.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 16, 2019~This staff here at this location have always been very friendly. They went above and beyond good service quite a few times, most recently when the power was out due to a car accident. I feel they care about their customers and I haven't gotten that from the Starbucks near my apartment. I choose to spend my money at this location due to the great staff!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Oct 21, 2018~Always prompt with your order. Staff is friendly. Have a long drive thru lineup in the am.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~May 2, 2020~I'm sad they are closed during this time. I have visited this Starbucks almost daily for the past two years. Everyone is always so kind and has great customer service. They even started to remember my drink after being a regular. They have the friendliest baristas on 7th street and bell. I used to to go another nearby but the baristas were not welcoming. Hope they open this one back up soon.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Sep 9, 2018~This location is always out of stock. It's a giant shit show. The staff isn't engaged, and doesn't seem to care a lot of the time. Mobile orders are prioritized over walk in orders. Staff doesn't appear to be properly trained to work the register. I've gotten so many refunds because I've been overcharged.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Apr 20, 2018~This location is always out of Cold Brew. However it gets a 2 Star because the staff is pleasant and quick.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Jun 19, 2018~My typical drink here is a iced cold brew with vanilla and sweet cream creamer (the best iced coffee drink I've had here, aside from their frappuccinos).I started going to the Coffee Bean for a few weeks but I wasn't near one today so I thought I would order the same thing I typically get at Coffee Bean at Starbucks since it's a pretty simple order and it couldn't be further from what I get there. I ordered an iced americano with vanilla powder and half&amp;half and it was super bitter and I couldn't even taste the vanilla. So I decided to get a cold brew with vanilla syrup and half&amp;half.. still bitter and blah. Sadly I don't think I will make Starbucks my go to spot anymore since I have become spoiled at Coffee Bean. The barista (with dark hair/bangs) was extremely sweet &amp; helpful though in trying to find something that resembled what I was going for!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Nov 20, 2013~This location is right next to my house, I ALWAYS stop here in the mornings to get my coffee, yet refuse to go through the god-awful drive through. The average time from start to finish is like 12 minutes. I  dont order anything fancy, so why should I wait for other people to get their fancy drink order? I just want my black venti coffee and be on my way. So walking in is the only way to go. Ordering a breakfast sandwich will add 10 minutes to your wait time, dont do it. Its a fun place to study, very interesting conversations going on around you. They also have a lot of outlets so you can charge your laptop, phone, etc. The guy who works the counter in the mornings is really sweet. Egh, its a starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~May 20, 2012~Let me start by saying I love Starbucks. Seating inside is a bit haphazard and very few comfortable chairs. Today, their espresso machines were out of order and a hand written sign was on the door to let you know as you entered. Now anchor machine falling out of service may not be preventable, but both machines, including the one for the drive thru?Were out of large straws as well which suck for those of us who order venti or Trenta size drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jan 19, 2017~Every Thursday my Aunt and I come to this Starbucks and every single time Ron is absolutely wonderful! He is funny, conversational, and always makes the trip memorable! Today is the year anniversary of her mom passing away so today was a little hard but he made today a little brighter! He and the rest of the staff make my favorite weekly tradition even better! A big thanks from us! We love you guys(-:
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Oct 3, 2017~This is the 3rd time I've ordered on the app 10-15min before coming in and my order wasn't ready. They forgot about my drink twice and literally made it infront of me after I got there. This time they made my drink I get there and they're standing around no ones in line and they forgot the food or didn't see the ticket for it or whatever so I waited and they threw the egg bites in a bag no holder (they were out) and it soaked through the paper bag material and dropped out the bottom. I order on the app on my way to work aka I don't have time to wait. He goes to remake it... I obviously don't have time and he's like ok have a good day... I'm like do I not get a refund!?! This place is the worst but it's the only one close to my work so I'm going to keep coming in and I'll definitely keep complaining until they start to fix this location. I decided to be even later to work since I'm going to get chewed anyway might as well vent about this Starbucks before I go in. This place is the worst. If you can avoid it, do.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Apr 22, 2011~This is MY starbucks....I go almost every single day. These are the reasons. 1) On my way to work2) Right next to my bank3) They are SO friendly4) They understand when I'm off coffee and order `"black water`" that I mean a coffee of the day, black. 5) The sweet girl in the drivethrough that is there almost every day I go always acts like it is her fault when I spill an entire venti hot coffee in my car. Even though I have an insurance policy on my car upholstery for a reason.....and it's not bad lids...it's that I should live in a bubble so as not to injure others!Love My Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~May 13, 2017~Normally this Starbucks is fine but today I had to listen to two obnoxious teenagers make fun of customers and their drinks while waiting for my coffee. McDonald's likely would have had better service. On girl with green hair was particularly loud in making fun of paying customers. Disgusted.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Sep 15, 2017~It seems like this location has gone downhill over the last few months. You can stress something enough in your order and they do it anyways.  It just seems like they've gotten lazy.  I hate to be that person who calls back about their order but, if you make my order wrong for the 5th time AND the frappuccino is completely melted consisting of mostly melted whipped cream then yes I'm going to call.  I can safely say that this is the crappiest frappuccino I've ever had.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Nov 14, 2014~Slow at the drive thru!!Grateful to get a couple comped drinks after a 10 minute wait in the drive through.Also it's hard to hear the word `"blonde`" on the speaker.  Also the barista complained to us about another customer.  Real professional.  Especially when he mouthed `"wtf`" to us!!  Kinda funny good thing we are cool people!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Sep 18, 2013~Not a fan of this location.  Try the one on 3rd ave &amp; south side of bell.Wow, someone actually managed to ruin a Starbucks location!!  Slow drive through, condescending service, and overall lack of interest on the part of the employees. We stopped in on my hunny's birthday on our way to vegas. This is the location closest to us so we wanted to just get in and out.  The voice on the drive through was kinda short with us, but I get it- you're busy.  We finally get to the window after over 10 minutes waiting.  The guy does not give us our gift card back.  I go inside and they can't find it. My hunny goes inside, and at least gets them to look for it and reprint the receipt.  Starbucks corporate reissued the card for us a few days later so in ended up fine.  Still, this location has no urgency!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Mar 6, 2017~Worst service Starbucks ever. No smiles. No acknowledgement. No thank you. Nothing. Perhaps they are robots. Corporate need to visit this with a secret customer to see how bad they really are. How hard is it to be nice?
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Mar 3, 2016~Last night I was working on my laptop at this location and was appalled by the employees. I work at SB often and am always pleased but in the hour I was here, the baristas were incredibly loud and offensive. They chased each other around the restaurant, hit each other, were continually laughing loudly, and playfully yelling at each other. One yelled across the store at a coworker, calling her a douchebag; the other yelled it back twice. They had a loud, two-minute conversation about poop, ranging from baby poop to `"old-person poop.`" One was wearing a black shirt that revealed her midriff. The word sh!t was used repeatedly. Two of them had their phones out at various points, showing pictures to the other employees. This was all done very loudly and it was obvious that I was not the only one who noticed. There was no friendly conversation between the baristas and the customers; in fact, it felt dang near unwelcoming, like they wished they could just have the place to themselves. This is an terrible representation of the respectable SB name.My coffee was good.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jun 24, 2019~I use the drive thru at this location all time early morning week days and today I visited later than usual and it was not a good experience it was actually horrible and disgusting. I grabbed my usual iced coffee and it was spilling all over my car as I drove so I waited to put the straw in until I got home and could control the spilling to then realize there was a hair in coffee stuck in the seal of the lid thank gosh so it was as visible before I drank it. Worst part was I didn't even get an apology until they gave me my remade drink and she then stated `"sorry it's all girls in here`" as if that would have made me feel better. I'm so grossed out, do better Starbucks !
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Dec 26, 2012~Worst service at a Starbucks I have ever experienced.  Keesh was rude and I will never recommend nor go to that Starbucks ever again.  The sad thing is there are way too many Starbucks with friendly good hearted people for me to put up with this particular negative store.  The coffee is the same in every store so why not go to another Starbucks or even The Coffee Bean.  I was so disrespected they received a comment/complaint on the corporate website from me.One chance is all they got.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 24, 2017~These girls are having a difficult time this morning. Not friendly at all and screwed up my order twice. I hope they at least made it decaf so I don't die in an hour. Go to this location at you own risk.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Apr 7, 2016~Hope you are not in a hurry because this is the slowest Starbucks location I have ever encountered. I thought they were doing better but not today. I've been sitting in the drive thru line for 10 minutes and there were only 3 cars including me. I don't understand why they are so slow!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Aug 23, 2018~I placed my mobile order as I was sitting at the light at 7th Ave and the 101. With Phoenix Morning rush hour traffic, it took me about 10 minutes to arrive at the location for my order, When I went inside, my order was not completed or the ticket pulled. As they continued to make drinks for the drive thru ( as I pulled into the lot behind a PV school van and they were at the window getting their drink, while I was still waiting), mine sat on the blender. I had to ask if someone could finish my drink as I was in a hurry, that's why I use mobile ordering.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 12, 2017~This is my go to North Phoenix Sbux. Staff is friendly, drinks are fast and accurate. All around a nice experience!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Sep 1, 2015~Average Starbucks location. Came here cuz it's close to my wife's work. Was hoping for a comfortable spot to get some work done. There are only 2 comfy chairs which were taken of course and small tables otherwise. One plus is there is a large conference table but not outlets at it.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~May 9, 2014~It's hard to find a place where people are happy amd cheerful at 430am on a friday morning lol. Well you can tell that the Starbucks staff at this location are trying their best to help everyone get their morning started off on the right foot. Im never happy waking up early, let alone having to work befor 6am so my hats off to them. This Starbucks is located very close to my house and the fact they have free-wifi gives me a nice place to enjoy a morning coffee while checking morning emails or just browsing the web. The coffee drinks are a little pricey but they generally are of high quality so its worth the little bit of extra money.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 7, 2014~I love that the staff is CHILL here. You won't find extra perky teenagers playing loud music at 7am. Yessss. Sometimes you just want to skip all the bs.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Apr 17, 2016~Worst customer service! A bunch of people working and took a few minutes to take orders. Then my iced coffee came up with no cream, so I asked the girl to put in the cream, and she got an attitude when she did, then didn't even stir it before giving it back. Then my friend got hers back and asked if it was supposed to have whip cream on hers because it never did before, the girl gave her attitude about that too. Worst Starbucks I've been too and it doesn't taste good either.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Aug 5, 2017~Second Saturday in a row that they don't have cold brew. And the breakfast sandwich that I like. And the drive thru is extra slow on Saturday's.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jul 2, 2020~worse location ,the staff is always rude . drive thru always forgets to give food items they  ! always gives me the wrong drink or makes it completely gross with no effort ! always closing random hours now and they wait until you wait in line forever to tell you at the window their closed lol...
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Apr 4, 2018~This Starbucks has to be the best ran, best customer service, cleanest Starbucks that I have even visited.  Ashley and her team are great.  I can't say enough about this Starbucks (I run my business out of Starbucks in AZ, Seattle and California) this is by far the best one in the company.  Great Job to Ashley and her team.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Feb 11, 2013~This used to be one of my favorite spots but lately it's been dirty almost every time I visit. Having been a barista, I know you can get slammed and get behind on the housekeeping but I have witnessed several times that employees seem oblivious to the mess on the floor, under tables, on chairs and around the condiment bar. The staff is always friendly and I still like to go but it's weird to sit and enjoy my java while looking at all the debris on the floor. I also inquired of one barista regarding what kind of milk they used, specifically asking about rgbh or rbst. She said they just buy the run-of-the-mill milk like the kind at Safeway etc. I will stick with the java &amp; espresso - don't want no hormones or steroids in my latte!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jun 13, 2015~Some days they have horrible service. But I enjoy most Monday's and Tuesday's here. They have a good team working the morning shift around 7am. I think his name is Jay. He's super friendly and has a very calm personality who knows how to get things done and right. I will continue coming here 3 times a week!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~May 8, 2015~Some days they have horrible service. But I enjoy most Monday's and Tuesday's here. They have a good team working the morning shift around 7am. I think his name is Jay. He's super friendly and has a very calm personality who knows how to get things done and right. I will continue coming here 3 times a week!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Aug 14, 2013~based on my one experience here it was positive. I used the drive through, the lady at the window was very nice.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Dec 17, 2013~The service is mediocre here. The drive thru is a very convenient but sometimes slow. They tend to be slower than most other stores and this store can get crowded really quick. I use this store because of the convenient location.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Dec 17, 2013~This has to be the SLOWEST Starbucks I have ever been to. I don't understand it. It doesn't matter the time of day/week -- its slow. If you don't have a good 20 minutes to wait, go elsewhere. And people if you have over 2-3 drinks to order DON'T use the drive thru! That's just common sense, right?! We got stuck behind someone that ordered 7 drinks! Not kidding... 7! Who does that?
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Jan 4, 2014~Great coffee, inside location isn't the best for hanging out and spending time catching up though.  The outside is fairly nice and offers more space.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Aug 10, 2013~Terrible service and the longest wait for your coffee. Even at 5:00am! I was told to 'wait' while the barista slowly, leisurely took out pastries from a box and placed in the case. I literally had to double check their times on the front door to make sure they were open - they had been for 30 minutes.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Mar 5, 2017~Skip this Starbucks! I've only continously have had issues with this Starbucks. The first instance that really stuck out was one morning we went, I asked for light ice. I was given a drink with heavy ice and asked them politely to remake the drink because I specifically asked light. The one gentleman asked one of the ladies there who was making the iced drinks while he man the hot drinks to remake the drink. She proceeded to act like I was not standing there and began to speak derogatory that she had to remake the drink. The gal who was manning the drive through must have immediately seen the look of horror on my face and began to apologize. I left and later contacted their management. Another instance was I was driving home and noticed my drink was very milky, but I like to sip my steamed milk part of my macchiato slowly. It wasn't till getting closer to home I realized that they never added the espresso. They were nice enough to make another drink, but it was inconvenient having to drive back. The only  reason I have gone back since because it is the closest to my house going north on 7th St. Since then the drink are always poorly made, and their services lacks luster. I don't visit this location any longer, I'll visit the one on 3rd St before this one. I'll even wait closer to my office near 7th St and Missouri before I get a coffee here.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Oct 13, 2014~Pretty good location, friendly barristas, the usual mainstream music playing, triple shot lattes with 2 pumps of vanilla galore.  Pretty close to home, might be the new go-to starbucks spot.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 28, 2014~Ok. First things first, this is the location near my friends apartment and I go to Starbucks almost everyday. I walk in to the lobby the first day and I ordered a breakfast sandwich(and somehow they gave me a lemon loaf cake which they were annoyed to exchange even though I had my receipt in hand), and I also ordered a iced white mocha. The girl on the register was obviously new and confused and it took her a really long time to get everything in the system and the manager on duty was obviously annoyed with her asking for help. The second time I went to this location I used the drive thru thinking it would be better, my friend got a black coffee and I got an iced coffee figuring this order was a lot harder to mess up....WRONG. My iced coffee didn't have WM sweetener like I asked it had classic syrup and cream instead. And to make matters worse... I am an employee of Starbucks. I gave the girl my employee numbers and she said `"wow you are a dinosaur`" UMM THANKS?! It has the potential to be a good location but far from it now.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Nov 7, 2013~If I could give them 0 stars I would. There's one nice younger boy who works occasionally. Other than him the staff is full of the rudest set of sorority rejects Starbucks could get. It's obvious they none of them want to be there and their sense of urgency is non existent. Don't go here if your in a rush to work! I avoid this Starbucks and just go to the coffee bean a few minutes out of the way. The few minutes out of the way is still better than waiting 15 minutes for a drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Mar 16, 2014~Generally speaking I almost always receive excellent customer service at most Starbucks locations. This particular spot is one of the few exceptions. I am consistently met with a poor attitude, forgotten orders, and improperly toasted bagels. The baristas don't like it when you try to make eye contact and act as if it's a huge inconvenience when someone walks in the door (unless you're the Jimmy John's delivery guy, then you're welcomed with cheers and smiles). If it weren't so close to home I'd never return. Alas, convenience makes a slave of us all.
Basha's 113~5~Feb 24, 2019~Stopped by after a long trip. Our Barista was all alone in the shop inside this grocery store. Although there weren't so many people waiting in line she was quick, efficient and most of all VERY FRIENDLY.  Her name is Limor, beautiful name. She deserves all the credit. Keeping up with our SIX DRINK ORDER. While keeping her friendliness and customer service. When we come by this area again in a few weeks, we hope she's here again for the great drinks and service.
Basha's 113~5~Jul 5, 2022~This is the only Starbucks I go to - everyday for my coffee. This is because the manager, John, well trains his employees as well as himself. I have no issues ordering any drink from this store. It is always made correctly and efficiently which is hard to find in Starbucks nowadays! I will definitely be sad if he leaves anytime soon! Keep up the good work, this is definitely the best Starbucks I've been too!
Fry's~4~Aug 10, 2019~Starbucks in frys. Service was quick and friendly. I requested a. Extra pump of caramel and they were happy to oblige. Made it great, and just how I like it. Store was very clean.
Fry's~1~Jul 3, 2021~Horrible service by Lena, and the management team. Avoid this franchised location by Fry's due to lack of customer service and professionalism.
Fry's~1~Oct 17, 2021~They were out of just about everything.I had to wait 5 minutes for a basic hot coffee. Wouldn't recommend this Starbucks.
Fry's~1~Nov 5, 2019~This location is a joke. I was just served by a young gentleman today around 1:30pm, and not only did he not greet me, but didn't even ask for a name for the order. He also apparently doesn't understand the meaning of `"light ice`" so when I was greeted with a rude `"Huh?`" `"What??`" I was beyond annoyed. I said my please and thank you and waited for my drink. He made my drink, left it sitting behind the counter, rather than giving it to me to sip on while he made the second drink, and took the order of 4 other customers. I had enough time to go put groceries back because I just couldn't wait to leave the store. Finally after about a 12 minute wait, he handed me my drinks and said `"you're welcome.`" I sure hope employee evaluations are coming up soon because this was by far the rudest Starbucks service I've ever had out of a location I already have low expectations of.
Fry's~1~Jul 27, 2019~Always have limited expectations for Starbucks stores located inside grocery stores, but this location never delivers a good experience.  Understaffed, never have their full food menu which is limited to 3 choices as it is, slow service, unhappy employees.  The appeal of Starbucks is the consistency, someone tell this store.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Mar 4, 2022~The Employee's that work here are extremely friendly and very good at what they do. Amazing customer service, I go here whenever i need my fix for coffee there really is no better place to go to than here because you can also get your shopping done it really is one of the best locations Starbucks has. P.S. Depending on who you ask, there is an awesome custom drink you can ask for that taste exactly like the turtles candy bar. called `"The Turtle`" Very sweet drink but it taste's amazing.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 21, 2022~If you want to find the one and only Starbucks with kind workers, head over to this one. I kid you not. From the time I placed my order to arriving at the window, top notch. Nobody is ever nice at Starbucks anymore. This location is worth the visit. Say hi to Arjay and that cute little thing who was taking orders! Thank you to the manager who came over and talked to me so I could give her crew a compliment. I'm still enamored by the kindness!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 10, 2016~I've been to many different Starbucks and this one is kind of my least favorite.  It's located inside the Safeway store which is good when you're wanting a coffee on your way out the door.  The reason I gave it two stars is because of the staffing.  There use to be regular workers there that I saw every time I went but ever since they finished school and left, there has been a huge turn over.  I rarely see the same faces anymore and each one is worse than the previous one.Three times I've been there and waited around for someone to walk up to the register until I decided to just leave after standing there for 10+ minutes without any service.  Other times I've been there and actually had the baristas make the coffee drinks of people that ordered after me and they'd make mine last which would make me late to work.  Or my favorite is when they start my drink and are almost done, but then customers walk in the door and they stop my order to take the orders of everyone standing in line and then they start all of their drinks before finishing mine.  Again, making me late for work because a 10 min stop turned into 30 mintues.Nothing really wrong with the drinks, I'm just tired of their customer service.  Constantly being passed up in the morning and lucky if I can find anyone in the afternoon.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 21, 2019~I give this Starbucks one star for the reason that they don't know how to make coffee here. They put too much milk can't taste the coffee. So if you go here Starbucks on 35th and Bell, take your coffee home and add more coffee so you won't have hot milk.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 6, 2020~They always have amazing customer service and I never have to wait too long. This morning around 10:20 (01/06/2020) I went through the drive thru and Rilee (I think that's her name! Blonde hair) was so helpful and sweet and made my experience wonderful.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 19, 2014~Don't come on a Monday. Sheesh, you will be here forever.Hire more than one person maybe. 3:30 to 4:00 you should not have to wait 20-25 minutes in line.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Feb 14, 2018~Love the staff that work at this location. There are days when they wait can be a little long, but they take the time to get to know their customers and vice versa.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 13, 2014~Great quick little Starbucks to stop at in the morning to get a cup of coffee. There is never a line and you can get in and out fast.
Safeway~5~Jun 30, 2022~Great stop. Barista was polite and helpful in getting us espresso grounds when asked for. Try their new cookies and cream cake pop.Got lucky and had a turkey bacon breakfast sandwich. Normally around this time, the sandwich is sold out.
Safeway~5~Oct 7, 2021~This is the first Starbucks in a supermarket I've been to with a nice seating area with comfortable lounge chairs. The regular Starbucks across the street doesn't even have comfy lounge chairs. This Safeway one is also open until 8pm vs. 7pm for the regular SB directly across the street.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Sep 5, 2024~excellent customer service, everything is freshly baked and packaged for our enjoyment, and the drink service outstanding, when people say extra caramel this is what we mean;)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jul 11, 2022~I love starbucks. This was my first time at this location, the drink tasted good but not really sure why it wasn't filled up. I ordered a normal drink on the menu, so it's not like I tried to cheat the system. I didn't feel like saying anything at the window but come on guys, paying for a latte should be a full cup.. I am loving these new shaken espresso drinks. The toasted vanilla is my new favorite. The brown sugar one is pretty good as well!The staff was friendly and quick. I placed a mobile order, and because the barista wasn't paying attention I almost got another Chris's mobile order  I said I only had one drink so took what was mine but y'all should be more careful because the other Chris might've not been happy if his drink wasn't ready when he came. Overall, I'll keep coming to starbucks. I'll give this location another try and we'll see if they fill up my cup to what I pay for
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Sep 27, 2023~Coffee was good but the staff are rude as hell. These people need to understand that us customers pays their salaries. I don't expect 5 star service but I do expect respectful employees when I'm paying $7 a cup and spent $30 on few items. And bathroom is gross
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Dec 23, 2022~It's better to go into the Safeway, they make the drinks perfect every time. The service and friendly and they know what they're doing.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 11, 2022~This is probably the worst Starbucks I've been to. They were out of all the flavors or add ins for the drinks I get and I have like 3 drinks I normally get. There was no mango juice, or dragonfruit so you can't do the Mango Dragonfruit Lemonade or the Peach Mango Black Tea Lemonade. I ordered a grande mocha frappe and they gave me a caramel frappe first then I had to wait 5-7 minutes at the window for the correct mocha drink to be made. It was not worth the wait either the grande cup was not filled all the way and it tasted like s***. Literally the worst mocha I've ever had. Sad to say but this Starbs SUCKS, please do not waste your time here. I won't be here to try again no other location has been this bad, you don't get your cup full and you wait for forever to get a drink that tastes like crap or wasn't what you had wanted originally.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 10, 2023~Very organized supermarket, clean restrooms and several practical services within it , including a Starbucks with awesome customer service! Their deli section looks fresh, the produce well stocked.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jun 6, 2024~The rudest employee I ever had the displeasure of meeting today worked at the Starbucks at 3549 W Bell, Phoenix Az.. when I needed to return a drink that was made incorrectly and request the correct drink. The employee 'Genesis' was the most offensive person I ever had the displeasure of meeting. I will never go to this Starbucks again. I have worked in the food and beverage field over the past 40 years. Which I Love. If I ever had treated a customer the way this 'lady' treated me, I would have been fired.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 26, 2023~Today is 50% off any cold drink and I went to a Starbucks previously but my coupon wasn't working so I came to this one and it still didn't go through. Although it wasn't going through, Adi (I hope I'm spelling it correctly) was able to figure out a solution quickly for us. She was really friendly and helpful. I appreciate that so much because the barista at the other location was no help. :(  Thank you for recognizing and helping us out today!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 1, 2024~absolutely horrible - HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE !!!!! the lady here - name is Jordan - when I asked her if she was going to take my name - she said oh well theyll just call it out in cafe - I'm a barista at another location , for another company and I know for a fact that is just not proper etiquette: in GENERAL. Then to add more , i ordered a grilled cheese and she asked me what do I want , rolled her eyes as if it was a problem that the answer to her own - unfinished question was yes I want my grilled cheese sandwich warmed up please - look I've been in customer service for over 20 years and even at month one of my journey I knew and understood common sense and proper mannerism. shout out to management here: bc this is your fault - lace your employees with style, grace and some f:;?!&amp;$ game man! Even one of the employees here yelling out `" it's a nightmare in here !`" As I type this : no duh !
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 20, 2024~Went to this Starbucks around 8 pm when they close at 9:30pm and there was no lights on and when I let them know I had ordered ahead and I showed up at the time it said it would be done the girl with the dark hair and arm tattoo on her left side said `" we just received that I would really appreciate it if you would put your order in earlier and come a little later`" pulled up to the window the we could see inside and the two girls were on the phone and laughing and when they finally got to doing the drinks they both hadn't washed their hands after handling their phones and went on to make our drinks. When the finally got done opened the window and practically threw out drinks at us and just shut the window. We were missing drinks and when we let them know we were they said that we didn't and we went back and forth and showed them the confirmation on the phone they looked back onto the screen and said oops looks like we might have pushed it out without making it. The drink was shoved into our face again and when we said thank you slammed the window in our face again. This is not the first time this has happened with either of those girl especially the one with dark hair and the shoulder tattoo if your working customer service I would think you would have better attitude then that and if they are doing that to us then they are doing it to everyone and need to go back to training or not be employed there anymore. * had to add a star just because it had me do it*
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Sep 3, 2023~Vanilla Latte's... should be sweet and taste like vanilla. And I know the employees here will disagree with this but... you are paid to make correct drinks and treat people with respect. This Starbucks does neither. Everyone should just go to Desert Eagle down the street. It's just better.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 7, 2023~I ordered online at this Starbucks location after driving some distance. I chose the pick up in store option and it was readily accepted and debited my account. Upon arriving at the store I found that the `"in store`" was closed and my only option was to use the drive thru. Unfortunately, I was driving a vehicle that couldn't navigate the drive thru lane. There were no cars in the drive thru so I walked up to the window. The worker there was very rude and told me that I couldn't walk up to the drive thru. Fine, I asked if he could pass it to me through the stores door. He rudely told me that he wouldn't do that. Now I have to go through the hassle of getting a refund online. Extremely poor management and customer service by allow online orders, but not following through. I've finally had it with Starbucks and will be asking for my credit card to be credited the amount in my account. Which will be immediately closed. I will never step into a Starbucks again. This was probably a blessing in disguise since they are overpriced and unhealthy anyways.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 29, 2022~You guys are still the best! My white chocolate mocha was the best one I've had lately! Kudos to the barista! Also got a banana nut loaf and the guy brought over the tray of loafs and let me pick my choice. I didn't ask,  he just offered it.  That has never happened before! I picked a big fat slice! Thanks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 12, 2020~I rate my caramel brulee latte a 10!! Excellent! Tasty and actually full and heavy! Great job!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Aug 31, 2019~Amazing experience!!! Amanda &amp; Emily are great! They took my very special request order of a drink I previously had made at another starbucks, and they recreated it! Super patient with me, which I appreciate, and made it taste actually 2x better than my first one! Extremely happy as the Easter bunny on this beautiful Sunday. Thank you guys so much!Months later! Another superior time here at Starbucks! They are always super patient with me and extra friendly! Kaelin/Katie took my order and were awesome!!! Thank you all a ton!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 21, 2019~Amazing experience!!! Amanda &amp; Emily are great! They took my very special request order of a drink I previously had made at another starbucks, and they recreated it! Super patient with me, which I appreciate, and made it taste actually 2x better than my first one! Extremely happy as the Easter bunny on this beautiful Sunday. Thank you guys so much!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 16, 2020~I am so FRUSTRATED!!! I do a mobile order but still have to sit in the damn drive thru line instead of walking inside, with my mask of course, to pick up my MOBILE order.What is the point of a mobile pick up if you still have to waste time in the drive through line????And I can't cancel my order because you already took my money. I have somewhere to be.The person that handed me my drinks kept saying well at least you can still pick it up here we're the only one really open at least you can pick it up here at least you can pick it up here not understanding my frustration won't be coming back to this location.And to top it off my drink was wrong!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Aug 31, 2022~Where is the old crew that was just there a few weeks ago. This new group are not too bright. This girl literally would not take my change with my bills to make a full dollar back in change because she said she would have to cancel my whole order, refund me and ring it in that way to calculate it for her. I guess counting to 100 was too hard. I asked for a lid for my pupcup because she handed it to me in a drink carrier and it was getting all over everything, I didn't want it all over my car and she said we `"don't have short cups`". I asked what they would put an espresso shot in and she froze, closed the window and walked away. WTH?
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jun 13, 2023~This 2 star rating is not for your employees but for you, corporate.   I grew up down the street from the first Portland, OR Starbucks,  I spent undergrads and graduate schooling studying and spending money in your store before it was cool or had a drive thru.  I have spent too much discretionary income in your store over the last 30 years and mostly to support your free education and benefits for your employees.  Today I ordered a venti shaken espresso in a grande cup and was told I could not and that I would have to pay more to add the extra shot to a grande drink making the grande size more expensive than the venti size with the same number of shots.  The venti has to much milk and sugar,  I want to taste my espresso.   This is just stupid  to charge me more and I will not give you my money again.  I've been coming to this location for 4 years 5-7 days a week.  You do the math,  usually get food too.  Chow
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 13, 2020~These guys are the best.   I've had very inconsistent experiences at Starbucks in Phoenix.   Now I am a critic but that is because I have been a Starbucks customer since there first expansion store in Portland, OR.   Customer service has changed since then but these guys (Scot, Colin, Michaela) have it dialed in old school.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 10, 2020~I went for something refreshing, &amp; let me tell you I got something refreshing! I got a strawberry lemonade on the rocks &amp; that drink smacked! The person who made my drink said its great blended, I'll be back next week to try that. Who ever made this drink really blessed me today. *chef's kiss* 10/10
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Sep 22, 2022~Meagan was truly unpleasant. I would not recommend her to work any positions that involves communicating with human beings. The drinks were fine.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Sep 4, 2021~Went here on a Saturday evening during Labor Day weekend and I was having a really bad day. To my surprise I got the sweetest genuine person ever! I believe her name is Cheyanne. She was so attentive while taking my order and just so very sweet, her high energy and excellent customer service skills made my day! Thank you for that.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Aug 27, 2021~The staff at this location is always friendly and polite when I go in. I have never had an order messed up and if my drink sits `"too long`" before I get there after ordering on the app they always offer to remake it (though I never take them up on it it's a nice offer)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Oct 19, 2021~Kids temp apparently means make it as hot as physically possible. I'm only typing more because it's making me in order to post it. The place reads it back and still messes it up. Impressive in itself which is why I gave it 3.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Sep 23, 2019~Been here a few times last time I was waiting for a long time at the window of the drive through but they gave me a grande for no extra cost. Today I went to get a Carmel ribbon crunch, it was me and a car behind. I was waiting at the window for about 5-6 minutes before the lady greeted me and took my card. There was a guy cleaning up, he could've helped while the girl was taking the other persons order. I get my drink and there is no Carmel at the bottom, it is watery, and there are none of those crunchy thing the put on the top. Poor service, gonna find a different Starbucks to go to.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Nov 29, 2021~Worst drink ever tasted nothing like how it's supposed to taste super disappointed I wanted this since last night and was so excited to wake up and get coffee literally tasted like gross water and it's supposed to be a flat white.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Jan 31, 2021~Ordered 2 caramel ribbon crunch Frappuccino's at the drive through. When I questioned the barista as to why they didn't have caramel on top she told me it does not come on top, just on the bottom. If you look at the menu it shows it drizzled on top. The drive through was super fast today though!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 21, 2021~This is my favorite Starbucks solely due to my favorite barista ever-Barbi!! She is full of joy and life and love. She is the reason is stop there almost everyday!! She acknowledges my kids and they love saying hi to her! I wish all of my Starbucks experiences were like the ones I have with her!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Dec 30, 2020~I've made this store in particular my go-to! The staff is always so friendly and patient, even if there's a line. They made my birthday drink for me with `"Happy Birthday`" written on the side and the lid, with confetti drawn on! It was so sweet of the staff. Timely and correct orders with kind people working there- you can't ask for much else!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 28, 2019~Came in for a Trenta frap and they said they don't make them that size. I always get that size at other locations. When handing my change he said there you go and hand me my change. No thank you or I am sorry and no receipt. Bad customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Sep 15, 2019~This Starbucks is my favorite location.  Everyone is so friendly here.  Sometimes I stop in with a list of 8 or 9 drinks for my employees and the baristas will take my list and make them all.  I expect to wait for that many drinks but they make them so fast.  They are cheerful and helpful here.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jun 14, 2019~Ordered a grande hot chocolate. The cup was 2/3 full. Went back couple days later let them know.  I was told it was policy. Seriously!!??  My policy is to pay for and get a full cup, especially at the prices they charge. I have a friend that is a trainer with Starbucks. She advised this is not policy.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 3, 2020~The drive through was hopping so I went inside.  The baristas were busy but took the time to greet me and send me off to meet my day with a genuine smile and  goodbye! They always make my day and my drink correctly. Love this store!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Mar 5, 2020~The drive through was hopping so I went inside.  The baristas were busy but took the time to greet me and send me off to meet my day with a genuine smile and heartfelt goodbye! They always make my day and my drink correctly. Love this store!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 26, 2021~If I could give a zero I would. What a joke! I went in with my computer about dusk to sit for a few minutes and use my computer. The entire place was empty. The employees said I could not sit down ( I am pregnant also by the way). They said I was welcome to sit at their tables outside. I said you mean by the homeless people who have set up their bedroom at your tables as all of them were occupied by NON patrons of the business. They said we can not enforce who sits outside. I said really it is your property and your chairs. You can enforce inside the building but you tell me I can only sit outside where there is no where to sit in an UNSAFE neighborhood in my opinion as it is getting dark. All because of COVID. What a complete joke and what complete idiots. Go where you are welcome and where they have balls to tell trespassers to get off their property and only allowed seating for PAYING customers.  Just terrible customers service.  Also did they not hear COVID number are down. Let's move on people.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jul 13, 2019~Morning crew rocks! Not sure if it's different employees morning, and then evenings but I can totally see AND taste the difference. if you like a whole lot of milk in your drink, rushed service and seeing dirty countertop with no caps on the milk (um bugs?..sneezes?), used coffee cup caps, the ice scooper on the dirty counter, the ice bin open for contamination, and drizzle spilled all over .. then go past 2pm. if you like an adult tasting coffee, not burned espresso, and amazing service then go in the mornings! yes it's extra busy because people are going to work but 1. they apologize if you wait 2. they're super friendly 3. they always greet and remember my doggy!! a bad coffee  can mess with your day, they don't mess up and they are extremely organized! Good rule of thumb for Starbucks.... always add less milk-  we can always ask for MORE but you waste product and time when you make an iced latte taste like milk...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 12, 2020~Always has a long drive thru line. Tried this place 3 times and they always messed up my order. They keep charging me different prices for the same order each time as well.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 10, 2020~Thank you for always making my drinks perfect. I pulled up Amanda greeted me and then said your usual and had my three drinks down pat. They are not normal drinks either. This day I had a migraine not a good start to my morning and she made me smile. First time this has happened to me with my order. She has a good memory. Thank you to all the employees there for always being so kind every time I am there.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Feb 24, 2019~Let me start off by saying, 'I'm not a coffee drinker'. Everyone once in a while I like having hot chocolate or tea and was happy when they turned this former Burger King into a Starbucks. However that start to slide downhill from there. First off, the place is nice and roomy with plenty of places to sit. The person at the counter said it's the largest Starbucks in the state which sounded cool. We arrived at about 07:50 PM which we were told the lobby closed at 08:00 but thought that meant they would just not let anyone else in at that time. We placed our order of one peppermint hot chocolate and a regular hot chocolate with pastries. Well, a few people order after us and were given their orders but didn't think much about it at the time. We were then asked if we received our order yet. We let them know we didn't in which we repeated what we ordered and they still got it wrong. Mind you, it was not busy at the time.Then, who I believe was the supervisor, proceeded to tell everyone that they had to leave now. Now believe me when I say, I completely understand that people want to clean up and go home at the end of the day but in my humble opinion, kicking people out of an establishment is a customer service no no. Especially if they're open until 09:00 PM at the drive thru. I would most likely not recommend this Starbucks to anyone looking for a place in the evening hours. Most likely you'll end up being thrown out on the street.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Oct 30, 2020~I just wanted to acknowledge the extra step these wonderful employees go. They have signs through their drive through, inspirational. Made my entire day!! The little things you do really do make a difference, keep doing what you're doing guys!! You're awesome
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Feb 1, 2020~Skip this location.  The drive thru is always painfully slow.  Drive a mile to I-17 &amp; Bell, way faster there.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jun 26, 2019~I get very frustrated with this Starbucks on Wednesday  mornings because they are particularly slow... this morning I am extra frustrated. I arrived in the drive thru at 9:05 AM (when my order was taken), I had maybe 4 cars in front of me, it took until 9:21 for me to receive my drink. I have never waited in a Starbucks drive thru this long before. I was then 10 minutes late to my meeting this morning. Please stop putting inexperienced baristas on in the AM hours as so many people are on a time schedule on their way to work. In the past, if I ever had to wait more than 10 minutes in a Starbucks drive thru, they have passed out 5 dollars of rewards points and I felt as if that was kind for the inconvenience. However, to roll up to the window, and not even have the barista apologize for the wait is unheard of. Very disipointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 21, 2019~this starbucks is so sweet &amp; welcoming!! my friend and i ride our horses through drive throughs all the time to get food and coffee, and the starbucks closest to us usually isn't very nice. we ended up over by this one so we decided to give it a try. they were so sweet and excited. definitely our new favorite:)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jun 8, 2020~Every time I place my mobile order it's ready when I arrive. All of the employees that work at this location are amazing and very friendly. I have yet for them them to be out of stock with anything I've ordered. I would recommend this Starbucks to anyone in the area!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~May 21, 2019~This is my first time at this location and it might be awhile before I go back. First off the screen is not working so you can't see your order.  I gave them my order and they repeated it back to me correctly. So I pull around and wait. I get to the window and the guy says you got the cold brew, tall water and blueberry muffin and I said no I got the iced caramel macchiato melted. He looks at me like I was making it or something and says hold on and starts talking to the girl taking orders and I said you guys repeated it back to me correctly, and he says we are really busy. Um ya I get that.  I wasn't really annoyed till they gave me my drink back layered and did not taste that good. I know 1st world problems but if I'm spending that much for coffee and you want a tip then do my drink right.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 7, 2020~The most unprofessional experience I've had with the baristas compared to any Starbucks ever
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 6, 2020~I want to start by saying I absolutely love Starbucks and spend too much of my money there and too often. With that said, this visit was the absolute worst because the girl in the drive thru, Emily, was a nightmare. She was rude from our very first encounter at the speaker, as in I pulled up and when she spoke, you could tell she wasn't in a good mood. After every drink, she would very rudely ask `"is that all`" like I had just interrupted her from doing something. I admit it was a large order, 7 drinks and a pumpkin bread, but her job isn't to judge the orders, just to take them. Plus, a good employee encourages customers to spend more money, not scare them away with rudeness. At the end of my order, she gave me the total but I realized I'd forgotten a drink so I let her know `"hey, I'm sorry but I forgot a drink.`" Her response was `"so you're adding ANOTHER drink`" in an extremely frustrated tone, like I'd just asked her to hand over her paycheck to me. Bottom line, Emily was very rude and needs to be trained in proper customer service. I've been in the restaurant/food/beverage industry my entire working life so 13 years now and I know customers can be annoying but that's no excuse for this girl Emily. I wasn't being one of those annoying customers...I wasn't being rude or difficult so she had no reason to be frustrated with me right off the bat. I've worked drive thru's before...in fact I worked in the same building when it was a Burger King. I've dealt with my fair share of difficult customers but I've never been so rude to a customer in my entire career. Working in sit down restaurants, I've had to take care of difficult customers from beginning to end, so a good hour at least, and I still never treated them poorly. She was just taking my order in a drive thru, only having to deal with me for a few minutes tops...I pulled up in a great mood but left with a sour taste in my mouth all because of this girl Emily. She needs more training in her customer service skills, her upselling skills and her basic human decency skills. That or she needs to work in a position away from customers or at a job that doesn't have customers. I don't think I'll be going back...at least not to this location. There's 3 other locations close by with much more caring employees who actually seem to like their jobs or at least know how to pretend.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~5 years ago~This is My Headquarters for all my meetings.I know all the Baristas by their first Names.Their NEW MANAGER, , Taylor Alviar , is a 10in all Areas. Her team is well versed in providing Professionally Customer Service. Taylor listens to her Teammates as well as her Clientele! The outcome is consistent return visit by Customers just like me. I am a Loyal Starbucks Customer . The store is always A+ Clean and well stocked with Promotions and CupsFor me , Th his is My FAVORITE STARBUCKS location In all of Phoenix and Scottsdale
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~May 2, 2022~I just went to this Starbucks knowing they were about to close and I believe the baristas name is alexTDs anyway I just wanted to ask if she knew where there was another location that was open and she just looked livid super rude and horrible customer service she might need a hobby or something because as much as Starbucks Pays she just looked pissed off that she had to close and she was giving BROKE vibes lol
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Dec 4, 2024~Tried a few new items. Did not care for the new summer berry refresher though. It tasted like lightly Flavored water. The boba had no taste also. But really enjoyed the pineapple cloud cake. Soft, fresh and topped with pineapples and cream, this was a good pastry.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~May 15, 2024~RUDEI am finally leaving a review after multiple encounters with the most unfriendly barista (Alexa) I have ever come in contact with. (Made sure to look at her name tag this time) The first time I thought, oh maybe she's having a bad day.... But I see now that she is just not meant to be around humans. It must take a lot of energy to be so unfriendly. The second I pull up to the drive thru and hear the unenthusiastic voice... it's just... so negative. The best way to describe it is as if we are ANNOYING her and bothering her by being customers. Never out of all the Starbucks and how I often I go have I come across someone like this.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jul 9, 2024~As a 40 year Starbucks customer, originally from Seattle, and gold card holder for 10 years, the few times I've been to this location, the same (female) evening manager insists on ignoring customers (making them/me wait unnecessarily), being rude, including arguing with me about the gold card refill perk.Today was my last visit to this location, ever.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Apr 12, 2024~This is a newer Starbucks well located at the corner of Thunderbird and 7th st. The staff is very courteous and professional. The drive thru is very busy. There's some nice outdoor seating and longer than average hours. I rank this an A Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Sep 30, 2021~I stopped here for the first time to get some coffee real quick. I got me a Ice Green Tea Sweetened since it was noon and 95 degrees 2 weeks ago. Nice staff and great neighborhood Starbucks to chill and have a drink. Nice atmosphere, Id visit again.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Jun 14, 2023~I hesitate coming here in the mornings their is this one barista who says nothing other than the total , she seems rude and bad vibe. She literally hands you your drink and looks away into the window inside.   I understand they are busy not everyone will receive a goodbye but tucking yourself inside to avoid eye contact is weird. (Their is actually a review below  of a barista with light brown hair and glasses ) who fits the description. Girl needs a new job if this is her.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~May 15, 2024~I'm not much of a review writer, but I just had to give a shout-out to this Starbucks, as I am very impressed with the quality of staff and the top-notch customer service.  Oh, and the coffee is good too.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Sep 14, 2023~The baristas and manager in the evening shift today 3/5/24 were very very rude. Upon ordering they were rushing me to take my order. When I pulled up the window to pay for my items. 2/4 items were incorrect. I had ordered 2 coffee frappes with whipped cream. I know the coffee frappes don't come with whipped cream so I ask upon ordering my drinks for it to be added. When I got my drinks they had caramel syrup on the whipped cream and the baristas and manager argued with me stating that the coffee frappe comes with whipped cream and caramel syrup and they do not on the Starbucks website. They took the drinks back and made new ones and once  again they were wrong. They had no whipped cream even though I had asked for it a second time.They were so rude about the whole situation and I am very upset. The manager is supposed to be professional and she was the rudest of them all. She was shoving the frappes in my face with a disrespectful tone saying if there is anything else they could do for me. I felt discriminated and I visit this Starbucks frequently and I'm not planning to come back.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~5 years ago~I guess friendly but I don't need a lecture with my coffee. I got a pup cup for my dog that had so much whip falling off the sides. When I asked for a little more cream that lectured me on they would need to charge me, for a splash. She said she would let it slide this time &amp; handed me my coffee back filled to the top (way more than I asked for) so now my coffee is all cream. Who likes a splash of coffee in their cream? At least now I know why she charges extra, she dumps the creamer in. I never knew making a simple request could be so hard to comprehend. I look forward to my coffee drink &amp; even more so my regular Starbucks crew on 16th st &amp; Bethany home who always make my mornings.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Sep 15, 2022~Made my day extra special this morning! I have various locations I drive thru and this morning I found a happy fun inspiring little message on my delicious London Fog latte!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Nov 10, 2020~the Starbucks is never open. Every time I come here I want to get myself a nice big caramel frappuccino because that's one of my favorite things to drink. Also my four year old son absolutely loves drinking this as well and it brings him so much joy. Only to drive 20 miles to this Starbucks to find it close. There's always a big sign in front of the store that says it's not open. I do not understand
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Jan 29, 2022~First time at this location. We're from Marana AZ visiting for the weekend. Very nice location to our resort. The Starbucks located there won't take our cards. Bret was very nice and personable.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 19, 2021~YALL I DONT WRITE REVIEWS OK!! but this Starbucks has just got it going on! The line may seem scary upon arrival but you're literally to the front of the line so fast and efficiently that it's literally never really a wait. The staff here are just so cool, friendly and FAST!! I just think they deserve recognition today! Thanks for making life a little easier!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Sep 12, 2023~This is the new location, behind the stripmall where the old, smaller Starbucks used to live.  This new building has a drive-through window, lots of parking, soaring ceilings, floor to ceiling windows, concrete floors.... this is starting to sound like a real estate listing, but the atmosphere is surely worth mentioning because you'll feel like you're in Seattle or Brooklyn when you arrive.  It's super trendy and upscale, almost elevating the neighborhood it currently sits in.  Perhaps a harbinger of more renovations to come...There's a communal sized table, bar stools and ducts... plenty of duct work for those who like that loft look.Service is good.  Drive through is crowded unfortuneately.  This was a welcome upgrade to this old-school neighborhood.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Nov 6, 2020~This is a new location and it's gorgeous inside.  NY or Seattle loft-like feel with exposed ducts and high ceilings.  Great atmo.  Drive through (huge improvement on the prior location in the adjacent strip mall).Yes, service was a little chaotic and lackluster but in fairness, it's crazy busy at this hipster location now that it's opened.  People in this area were dying for a decent Starbucks and the prior one in aforementioned stripmall was run down.Close to North Mountain park.  Easy access for those crossing town on Cactus.  Nice upscale place for the area.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Apr 15, 2018~I rarely write review but this girl was beyond rude to me for no reason to my shyness I rarely talk but she took it personal. Girlie pop with light brown with a ponytail and glasses. I don't understand why she was so rude. I said thank you for my drink &amp; she say your not welcome because I'm shy. Girl bye.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 4, 2023~We visited on Christmas morning.  The store was beautifully decorated. There was holiday music playing at a nice level which added to the festive ambiance.  The staff were all dressed in festive attire and were so friendly.  Our drinks tasted great and were made quickly from scratch.  This was a great way to spend Christmas morning!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Dec 25, 2019~The SLOWEST Starbucks drive through I've ever been in, and there were not that many cars in line. Most of the staff inside were moving in slow motion and looked miserable (when I finally got up to the window, I noticed)
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 6, 2022~The service is to die for. They are always nice and interactive. They will make you feel welcome. One particular barista was Shayne, he is the definition of perfect.. Friendly, patient and informative. Had me try my drink since it was new before I left and that's super convenient.
break
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~5 years ago~There is literally a Starbucks on every corner in N Phx. It's a blessing and a curse. Always good for a coffee on the go, all these drive throughs are game changers. I'd recommend going to C Phx or downtown to drink coffee, chill, and support local
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Dec 10, 2020~I never leave reviews but the way the barista preparing our mobile order treated us I had to. The manager of this store needs to speak to the employees about how you treat a customer. We will never ever come back to this location after this experience!!! So rude you don't treat people like that ever. She made my drink wrong and when I asked to fix it she got mad and said she has other drinks to make.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Sep 11, 2021~My friend and I came here after hiking on north mountain. Building was clean, staff friendly and efficient, several chairs and tables, and plenty of parking. Would come here again as they were great.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 30, 2019~This is for the 7th street and thunderbird location . They are so awesome ! They always know your name and greet everyone with a smile ! If things aren't right they fix it immediately !They even know both of my dogs names and always offer pup cups when I do a walk in order ! Love these group of people !
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Sep 16, 2020~I come here everyday. I actually spend 100$s at this store believe it or not. Today I'm on an important call with my mother. I run to get my coffee should take all of two minutes but instead. I grab this cup of milk pictured here. I have to hang up go back in and ask what's up. Takes about five minutes of...the manager to yell at me that I'm wrong for asking why my coffee looks like this. The barista continues to tell me that they give an 2 shots in each coffee they serve you no matter the size they just add more milk.. and more ice... so it's just looks weird... so ripping people off?! Essentially?! You give people the same amount of coffee in every size and more milk and ice so what you're telling me is IM GETTING RIPPED OFF?! And I'm stupid for asking about 5$ coffee that has NOTHING BUT MILK... Yeah I will never be coming back. Thank you for the gentlemen who remade it and asked if it that was right. Yes, I finally got coffee. If I wanted a cup of milk I would have bought a jug of Milk! Which is five dollars! I paid for coffee... customer service tip the customer is always right... I literally can tell visibility here this isn't right! So you just lost on a thousand dollars a year customer. Cause I drink coffee from here everyday... light ice or not still three shots in a venti end of story.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~May 21, 2020~Newly opened Starbucks on the corner of 7th and Thunderbird. This spot offers a large parking lot and a drive-thru which their last location didn't have. Same hours and same menu from their last spot, but this place is open and have plenty of seating both indoors and out for those that want to just sit and relax while having their tea or coffee.On the occasion that I came, I think they had just been in their new location for about a week. They were still training the new staff, but they worked quickly and efficiently to take and fill my order. The guy at the register was very friendly and answered questions I had with knowledge about a new drink. He spoke clearly and actually looked me in the eyes while speaking with me.Drink came out quickly and tasted just how I like it. No complaints here. Store was clean and organized. Sugar and cream was filled. Tables wiped down and floors swept. Will come back to this location again.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Oct 5, 2017~My drink was made with more of one ingredient. Looked nothing like what my order usually looks like. They were kind enough to remake. But when I tried to tell them how I liked it they didn't listen to what I was saying and added more of the ingredient that I asked less for and told me that's what they did. I will not be coming to this location again...
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Nov 10, 2022~I rarely write bad reviews but I felt the need to do so this time . I usually go to another Starbucks but on Monday (6-24) my boyfriend and I came here . There was one car behind us and one car in front of us . When we were ordering we felt so rushed and we felt like the girl was kind of rude . We got our drinks and they were fine done e didn't think too much about it because everyone has some off days . The next day Tuesday (6-25) at around 6 am we came here again . Once again a different girl , named Lisa rushed us on the radio and when we got to the window she had our order wrong . We had asked for my drink in a reusable cup . The first thing she asked for my reusable cup . My boyfriend kindly told her `" oh no she wanted hers in a reusable cup , we want to buy one `" to where she said `" Oh that's different you're gonna have to wait a minute then `" .. looking very bothered . We kind of just looked at each other and shook our heads but we just sat there and waited. Then she opened the window and told us the price. As my boyfriend handed her his gold card he said `" I have a free reward and can you reload it with $15.`" She said ok and closed the window. Next thing we know some guy named named Ross came to the window and said `" For future references , if you have a free reward you need to tell us before we reload the card .`" We just said ok then laughed because we did tell them at the same time and so we figured that Lisa probably did the transaction wrong . Finally we ask for a cup of ice water ( before they even handed us our last drink) and Lisa says `" Next time you have all these requests can you just come inside.`" I couldn't believe it . I am an everyday Starbucks drinking and this is the first time this has every happened . I never have `" sooo many request `" and it's never a big deal for some water . I have never been treated so rudely. If it had been my fault I would not be writing this but not only were most of the issues their fault but then they tried to blame us like it was our fault . Even if it had been my fault ... CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT . I've worked in customer service for a long time . I get we all have bad days but do not take it out on your customers . Safe to say I will NOT be back to this location again .
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jun 26, 2019~Leaving the store just now. Frustrated and very disappointed. The mobile order that I placed was not ready when I came. Barista tells me that the sticker was not issued. I could not refresh my feed in the store in the app, so I couldn't prove that I actually ordered it. She offered it to make one but then got pissy with me about doing me a favor. I'm driving away to the next store on the third third Street and Bell Road where they have way better service. And sure enough the order just showed up in the app. Barista on 3st/bell made it. Every time I come to 7/TBitd there is an issue of some sort - unpleasant if not rude employees etc.  if you can drive to 3/Bell- please do, way better experience! Will be calling Starbucks. Unbelievable
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Apr 27, 2021~Let me just say that I love Starbucks. But this location is horrible. My husband and I get Starbucks from this location a few times a week for atleast the past year. I have turned a blind eye to drinks being made incorrectly (ordered a frappuccino but got the hot version) and lack of food items but will no longer continue to go to this location after my last experience.  My drink was so hot that it actually scalded my mouth badly. I've been drinking coffee for many years...I've was even a barista for 3 years and this drink was too hot to safely serve. Won't be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~5 years ago~Just came to order Starbucks, barista was very rude, had an attitude and must have been in a bad mood. We ended up cancelling our order and leaving due to her demeanor.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 31, 2021~This has got to be the slowest walkup service I have ever had at a Starbucks.  I would recommend going to another place
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Apr 14, 2022~THE WORST STARBUCKS IN THE VALLEY. they are extremely incompetent for one and then have an attitude on top of their incompetency. First off the drive-through is a nightmare because the soundboard is facing seventh Street and they can never hear what the fuck you're saying so then you try to go inside to prevent that issue and just nothing is flowing correctly and no one seems to know what's going on. I spend $150 a month at Starbucks through multiple locations and this is by far the worst spot.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Oct 22, 2018~First time here.  I went at 6 am and there was nobody there, no lines. I went thru the drive thru.  I didn't look or drink until I got home.  They gave me half a cup of coffee, I am not stretching the truth and I don't mean an inch or two from the top. I'll try to post pics. I looked up the phone number on Google and it is someone's cell number and they didn't answer, probably too many complaints.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~May 5, 2019~This is the best Starbucks ever. I have been going here consistently since the pandemic started and can attest to the quality and reliability, as well as the incredible friendliness, of this Starbucks team.  Sometimes, they even provide us with personalized notes or stickers to make the day a little brighter. I feel badly that I order through Uber eats instead of directly with them, but I plan to provide them with my patronage when I do go in person more! Although, let's be honest- What's better than a steaming hot macchiato delivered right to your door?? Not much when youre teleworking and the world is on fire. THANK YOU, Starbucks in 7th/T-bird, for bringing `"Uber eats Zach and Erin`" happiness these past several months! We adore you!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Aug 25, 2020~Came here on a cold night to get a warm drink because the location at 19th and Bell was temporarily closed.  Pulled into the drive thru at 8:01 and was told they could not help me.  2 different Starbucks within 10 minutes, and got zero service.  Terrible service.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Mar 4, 2022~Starbucks was great! Uber Eats service was horrible!Starbucks had their order on time and Bray was Great but I would Highly recommend NOT use Uber Eats!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 1, 2021~My daughter and I always do mobile order. This is the first time we used this location. Unfortunately they got the orders wrong  We did not have time to get them corrected but how hard is it to do SOY milk and light ice. We got both drinks with coconut milk and extra ice. The stickers on the cups were correct but the actual order was wrong. And of course I was charged for the SOY. We will NOT be using this location again.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 6, 2020~I have never had to write a bad review about a coffee shop, especially Starbucks, however I have given this location the benefit of the doubt since it is the closest to where I live, only to be disappointed yet again. The employees at this location have proved to me 5 times that they have selective hearing. Super simple drink, screwed up 5 times in a week. Usually I am in a rush and don't have the time to bring it to their attention, however today I had the time. I let the barista know that my simple beverage should have cream in it... she literally poured HALF of my drink out in front of me, and doused it in cream. Never mind the fact I paid extra to add an extra shot of espresso, and flavoring... half of it went down the drain. Then when I ask it to be made correctly, the cashier rings up the order incorrect, again. Consistency is key in my mind. If I order a drink at one location, it should be the same at every location... not the case at this store. Save yourself the frustration and just go elsewhere for your coffee needs as this store is a waste of money, time and energy.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Mar 17, 2021~Clean, efficient and friendly staff, this location has no problem making keto/special dietary consideration coffees and teas. It's been tough to find a location that suggest low or no carb options, but this one's got it. Drive up is available too.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~5 years ago~I come here at least 3x a week but I want to say that yesterday June 3rd I came up here after the worst day ever, my mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and helping her through the pain and the frustration has honestly been more than I can bare and trying to put on a brave face while working is tough. I came here to get my usual egg sandwich and a tea but realized I left my wallet at work and could barely pay for the sandwich, the nice lady at the drive through said it was fine and gave me the tea anyway. I don't know her name but I just want her to know that small act of kindness had been the best thing that had happened to me all day and I actually cried over it while driving back to work. Thank you so much whoever you are, I hope that you see this.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Jun 4, 2019~this location is alright sometimes, but most of the times I come they either don't have an ingredient or a drink that I want, there was one time I ordered a hot medicine ball and the guy gave it to me but it didn't have one of those stopper thing you put on the hole, so when I took it and drove away a it burned my hand, I was very agitated.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Sep 19, 2021~This is a cute Starbucks, nice staff, pretty speedy service. They have a tiny patio area and it's basically just the sidewalk in front of the store.It was very busy when I went but it was raining for once in phoenix. The service was speedy and though it was packed, still friendly. I know I'm repeating myself but I have no patience when it comes to slow baristas. There was a lot of space in the shared lot to park and lots of seating available inside even considering the large crowd hiding from the rain.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Apr 27, 2014~Slowest Starbucks I've ever in my entire life been! Every morning I have to go out of my way to another Starbucks because this one is on my way but I wait at least 15 minutes in line every single time! They either need to pay to have more staff and get rid of the big profit margin... Or they need to fire who they have an actually get people that work
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Feb 15, 2020~Meh. This was odd experience. I attended this location with my mother about 730 am, and we are greeted  by a kind woman named Emily who worked the cashier. We ordered blonde brew coffee with soy milk, as well as a dragonfruit refresher along its an order of eggs and a croissant, we proceeded to the patio and my mom received her coffee, removed the lid to put in sugar and the milk had curdled. She was immediately turned off and asked that I take it back and just get her an iced tea, i returned to Emily and she told me they change the milfs every 20 mins and then read me my total for the venti iced tea... i look down at the full cup of curdled coffee  and she says I'll pour it out. I said okay paid for the 3rd drink. Starbucks treatment of people needs to be better.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jun 3, 2019~My most favorite Starbucks! The baristas are amazing. They go above and beyond to make sure I'm taken care of. I love the new store!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Nov 22, 2017~Utter chaos... Six people working behind the counter, half of them assigned to the drive-through alone. The one register worker frequently left the register to fix food orders rather than take the remaining orders from people standing in line.There were several people ahead of me in line when I walked in. Each one of them had a major issue with their order.Starbucks might want to have a talk with the store manager and get their processes a little more rehearsed.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 7, 2018~Poor customer service. Drink was horrible. Taste like I am drinking a glass of milk since they decided to put my grande drink in a venti cup to make up their lack of attention. Took my order at the screen and then had to repeat it all at the window.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Apr 3, 2021~This store is amazing! The baristas are friendly, always smiling, and make me and my kids feel so welcome. Even if there is a mistake made, they're always quick to make it right!I never go anywhere else!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Sep 6, 2018~This is my favorite Starbucks! I've been to so many starbucks in Arizona, more than 15, but this one is the best. They always make my drink exactly how I want it, it's always consistent, the attitudes of the employees is awesome. The coffee never tastes burnt or old, my espresso shots never taste dead. The wait is never long! Thank you for being exactly what i need from a coffee shop!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~5 years ago~Good Starbucks. Staff rocks. Lots of outlets for power if you need it. Only problem is it's always so cold in there. Seriously, coldest building I've ever hung out in. Bring a sweatshirt!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Dec 8, 2019~Educate your baristas on coffee... My girlfriend went on a coffee run and asks me if I want something. I tell her I wanted a tall cafe au lait. I said it is probably called a misto here in Arizona. (In the south it is cafe au lait.) SOOOOOOOO simple. Coffee with steamed milk. That's it. The barista didn't know what misto was, didn't know what cafe au lait was. Even after an explanation was super confused. Says, `"Oh that's a latte.`" ARGH. No... It's not. Don't want the caffeine blast of espresso shots. Regular coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 13, 2016~Best Starbucks around. The evening staff are above and beyond awesome. When I go in there, I feel like I'm stepping in to Cheers. They all know my name, what I order and ask about my family, my business, my basketball injuries.Tip them well and they'll take really good care of you!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Mar 9, 2011~I came with my 6-year-old nephew today on a coffee run &amp; we were asked to leave (after we had already ordered) because he forgot his shoes. Really? A 6-year-old forget his shoes on a quick coffee run down the street from our house and you ask us to leave the building??!!! This is totally unaccommadating for families!!! Not to mention we had already paid &amp; we had to wait an inordinate amount of time to order! I am not coming back especially with my family and kids.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 19, 2018~Love this location!! It's brand new so it's very nice! The customer service is great, everyone is so sweet and so convenient since it has a drive through! Definitely loving that we have a closer Starbucks (since I'm addicted). We visit this location very often, love it!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 7, 2018~I've been to this Starbucks a few times and each time have been very disappointed. Today was the last time I will go to this location. I asked for a white chocolate mocha and got something that looked like iced milk. I told the guy at the window it was the wrong drink and he didn't even want to hear it. He said no it's not but already late to my location, I just took the drink and left. Also, as you can see the drink isn't even labeled.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jan 1, 2019~Another great review for this Starbuck's. I would like to recognize Petros. He always gets my order right, and he is very friendly. It doesn't matter how busy he is, he will take the time to say hi. I like to come to this Starbuck's whenever possible. Matty and Melissa are great too. And of course Dallas. Dallas is great with my adult son who has autism.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Nov 13, 2017~Boyant is a great employee!! He is always in a great mood when I'm there, and my order is always correct!! One day I came first thing in the morning, and we waited outside until the manager came. Boyant kept apologizing and kept us in a good mood while we waited. This is my favorite Starbucks, and even though the new store is opening next week with a drive thru, I will still go inside just to visit with the staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Sep 15, 2017~This is my favorite Starbucks!! My two favorite employees are Dallas and Melissa!! They know what I like, and know me by name. Everyone is nice, but these two go above and beyond!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Aug 28, 2017~Not sure when they moved to this newer building. Busy location with a drive thru. Used mobile order to place my order about 5 minutes before I arrived. My order was waiting for me despite being fairly crowded. Nice outside seating and large parking area. Easy access.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Feb 25, 2018~Just saying, I frequent many Starbucks throughout the valley and don't bother using mobile order at this location. They took much longer to get those orders out than other locations. I will say that their black iced tea tastes better than other locations so they've got going for them.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Feb 10, 2018~This location needs to learn the menu.  We were charged $1.00 more for our regular order than normal and then.... the drinks were not right!    The gal at the window handed us the first drink which was overfilled and told us to be careful because it was all over the top and outside of cup.  She didn't offer a napkin or anything.  I will not return to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~5 years ago~SERIOUSLY. The last time I was here I ordered at the counter and it took eons. And the staff was less than impressive with their guest service. This time, I ordered with the App and arrived 15 minutes after ordering to find that my drink still wasn't done. (The app guessed a 4-7 minute order) I definitely get the `"No time? No wait`" promise with the app.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Mar 25, 2016~S L O W. Only two people working this afternoon. Maybe a one time fluke? There was a self proclaimed new hire working the register and someone else making drinks. The latter was very mean. She mocked the new hire in front of guests (who encouraged it with laughter). I don't know. I was really uncomfortable with the way she spoke down to her coworker. Anyway. There we're three people in line and it took me like 20 minutes to get my drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Mar 15, 2016~Nice and new Starbucks but there WiFi sucks. can't listen to online lectures here cause they keep cutting out or buffering. I like the atmosphere though.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Nov 4, 2017~My local Starbucks always call in her for frappacino and they always he fast and friendly service.Only downfall no drive through
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Mar 24, 2016~This a the typical, poorly run Corp store.  Inattentive and disappointing accuracy in filling orders   I go to the Safeway and get wonderful personal service from Espy and teammates. Better managers and training are needed at this amateur run joint.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Aug 9, 2020~When I have to go to Starbucks (and because of my girlfriend's Caramel Machiatto with too many shot addiction i often do) this is the one that pisses me off the least. I have had a string of bad luck with service and drinks at other locations but the people working at this location really have their shit together. The espresso is hardly ever even burned! Almost everyone who works here is sweet as daisies and they even occassionally let me out with my black coffee for free. The location is generally quiet and well behaved as far as patrons go so I don't even mind hanging out for a bit to work on my crosswords.This location does a great job of reminding me that Starbucks was once a neighborhood coffee house with good business values.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Apr 28, 2008~This is my neighborhood Starbucks. Let's face it: Starbucks is the fast food of coffee. You are looking for consistency and efficiency and you get it here. Even when the line stretches to the door the staff are smiling and friendly, moving through the orders as quickly as they can. And, despite the criticism that they're `"corporate,`" those barristas know my name (and my drink), even when I don't remember theirs! If I've been on a roll and coming in daily, they are courteous enough to start my drink even before I get to the register. When it's been a while, they remember my drink but check to make sure that's what I'm in the mood for on that visit. They have started a rewards program where you can get a free drink for every 15 transactions or with a whole bean purchase, free refills on brewed coffee and tea and they won't charge you for (select) syrups and `"milks.`" Plus you get a free drink for your birthday. Another perk: I have Starbucks to thank for a lot of the more recent downloads on my iPod, thanks to the Pick of the Week. I grab one of those cards by the register whenever a new one is out and redeem the free download and I really have `"discovered`" new artists.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Dec 16, 2010~This is my favorite Starbucks by far. Every barista here is awesome. Always friendly, know my drink, drink is always correct
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 29, 2015~If I could give this store 0 starts I would. The baristas were very rude and kept giving dirty looks in the drive thru window. I will never come to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~May 8, 2020~Another large Starbucks location with tables aplenty!  The weather is perfect now mid-day and the hipsters are out.  Pros of this location:Cranberry cheesecake-desserty thing samples on the counterThey spelled `"Erin`" correctly, and normally.Cons of this location:I can't find any outlets! Perhaps that's why all the chairs in the corner are full?  Good thing I charged up at the last spot, which had outlets below all of the tables that I looked at.This one, too, is a little chilly.  It's November in Phoenix so naturally half of us are bundled up in sweaters (albiet flip flops) and the other half are in sundresses and short pants, but I thin it's cold for all of us here. I can see goosebumps on my fellow caffeine fiends.The pros outweigh the cons and the ladies behind the counter are lovely and light-hearted, so I'm a fan.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Nov 15, 2014~This is the closest Starbucks to the Pointe Tapatio Cliffs.  Keep that in mind because if you ever stay there you will not be able to find any kind of coffee after 11:00 AM.  That's another review.This Starbucks kept us going morning, noon and night during a visit.  They never messed up our order, had fresh pastries every day and everyone was quite friendly.  The only reason it's four instead of five stars is, well, it's still Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~5 years ago~So I'm a coffee fan through and through, and Starbucks to be sure is near the top my list usually. While this Starbucks is fine, staff service seems to be lacking. Service is make a break, and unfortunately it's not making the grade today.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Feb 27, 2012~This is the worst coffee shop I have ever been in. Terrible service long lines and more. very dissatisfied
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jun 17, 2018~The staff at this location has ZERO sense of urgency. It drives me crazy! Be prepared to wait in a long line and cross your fingers they get your order right when you've waited 10 minutes to get a coffee. I would offer this advice for such a popular location... Have someone taking orders of customers waiting in line! Every morning you have a line that expands all the way to the front door. This location would be ideal if management spent some time with their staff on time management.Wake up Starbucks! Let's get going!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Nov 26, 2013~Best Starbucks  Ive been coming here since it opened and I've never had a bad experience! All the Barristas are so nice and very friendly and helpful! I love the convenience of the drive thru. Recommend for sure and I will keep going back!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Mar 28, 2018~This Starbucks... oh my goodness! Whoever was taking drive thru orders today 12/1/2018 was quite possibly the nicest human I've ever encountered. He was so sweet and well spoken, helpful, and make something as typical as ordering a coffee SO lovely!!! He even helped me pick out a new breakfast item from the menu when I didn't know what I wanted. He made my morning. I wish I knew his name so that I could write to the company and sing his praises.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Dec 1, 2018~Usually i am very respectful of times and simply just nice with service workers. but i sat in that drive-thru line for 15 mins only 10 mins after 8pm when they said they close at 9pm. The worker was leaving in his car the store and closing the store when i finally gave up and drove out of the drive-thru. Are you kidding me :/ they weren't even closed yet!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Aug 27, 2019~I usually come to this Starbucks And they always Make my order right. But today was the worst experience I went through the drive through To order 3 drinks and they took like 20 minutes to give us the drinks and there was only 2 cars in front of us. When we got to the window they took another 5 minutes And the girl didn't apologize For making us wait so long and she also forgot To give us 1 of our drinks so we had to tell her. She looked new but she still should of apologized .
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Jul 9, 2019~This location has plenty of parking and seats available inside even on a crowded day.  There is not a lot of outdoor space, only a small patio on the side that's part of a sidewalk.  Staff was friendly, but service can be a bit slow.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Dec 1, 2015~Usually a line but not too bad.Service good as is the selections of pastry &amp; coffee.Heard they were taking over the corner behind them where Shell gas station was but seems to be on hold.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Nov 18, 2016~Nice Starbucks to hang out for a little while. There's even a community library in the back with lots of books including children's stuff. Friendly service and in addition to the regular pastry and sandwich offerings, they have Vosges chocolate here (yum).
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~5 years ago~Never been to a worse Starbucks.  Went to the drive thru and Kim was rude and unfriendly. She was more concerned with continuing the conversation with her coworker. No sense of urgency unlike the other locations I've been to.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 10, 2014~They always make drinks correctly, it's almost always clean (even when they are busy), and they are always very professional.  And they take care of people who love coffee.  I once asked what they had brewed and it wasn't dark enough roast/too acidic for my stomach.  One of the baristas made me an amazing cup of the Italian blend with a press.  It was wonderful.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Dec 15, 2016~Total chaos (even for a starbucks).  The unfriendliest staff. Can't even say sorry when they make a mistake
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Mar 31, 2018~The staff is always very friendly.   I love the iced green tea!  Always ask them to not add water.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jun 28, 2016~Been here a few times and the baristas are always very nice and super quick with your order. Place is also really clean. Will always come back given the chance.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Jul 4, 2015~Plenty of tables and windows. The corner location offers w nice view. It's always populated and the crew is friendly and fast. The plaza is easy to access and the parking is not bad at all. It's clean. Good coffee and fresh pastries.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jul 8, 2015~This place needs to get their stuff together.    I should not have to tell them that blueberry oatmeal needs blueberry and water.     Not busy so that is not an excuse.   Then the guy put cold water in ... still waiting to eat that.  Smh
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 13, 2017~The girls here are always cheerful and make a great mocha frap no whip with drizz. The positive energy and expertise there with the level of foot traffic, deserves the kudos. Thank you STRBKX and Kudos for training and selecting the best.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~May 1, 2016~Have been there twice for the cranberry bliss and both times have been out . How can that be ? It is a seasonal product . The lady was rude about it as well
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 13, 2017~ best starbucks around &amp; probably one of the best i've ever been too... &amp; i'm not just saying that because i work there, but it really has a great atmosphere, huge lobby to come study or just hangout, &amp; the drinks are always good. :]
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~5 years ago~The new store needs a huge lesson on customer service! If there is 6 people behind the counter and you have to stand at the counter for more then 4-5 minutes with not one person saying `"hello`" or `"hi I will be with you shortly`" nothing! Just walk past you 5 times with no words. Twice now I have a experience that in the last week. I understand you are busy in the drive thru but a simple greeting or acknowledgment would make it a whole lot easier to wait 5 minutes before you are helped.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Oct 3, 2017~All Starbucks are not created equal. This location is good. Staff very friendly and helpful and the coffee was good!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 8, 2013~Great staff! They are so genuine and treat you like a person, not another transaction. This is what coffee shops are all about. In a rush? Brew at home or wake up earlier.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Feb 13, 2014~Wonderful staff, great positive atmosphere!  Service was quick and product was perfection!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Feb 6, 2014~Don't judge a book by it's cover! I recently started coming here and from the outside it looks small and corner-ish; almost like a diver bar. However as soon as you walk in the door you feel as if you have walked into a Costo. I could almost play basketball in the store. The spaciousness is really important to me and you can pick a good seat and survey the entire store. The wall strip of never ending outlets to plug in whatever electronic device is more than useful. The staff are all really affable and cater to your specific needs. Def a great local to read, study, or just get some work done!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Aug 21, 2014~This is a pretty neat starbucks location. It is well kept, clean, clean bathrooms, and good service. They have yet to mess up a coffee order for me and my co workers. The coffee is consistently pretty good, and the place is quiet if you want to relax and read.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Aug 5, 2015~What's happened here. `"Do you have a blonde roast?`" `"No, all we have is Pike.`" At this point you're usually asked if you're willing to wait while they do a pour over or an Americana...not this barista. Got my `"Pike`" and headed for the napkins...empty. `"Do you have any napkins?`" `"No, we're out.`" .... Not up to standards this particular evening.....
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jan 25, 2017~This is a great Starbucks! Their service is always fast and my order always accurate. The baristas are very friendly, Cody especially! I try to get to this Starbucks as often as I can.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 3, 2015~A great safe place my junior goes there for study time with her friends and they even brought in a pizza! They are quick and accurate and nice
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Sep 21, 2015~Always friendly, fast service, plenty of tables to relax both inside and out. Great location,  easy in easy out, it could only get better if it had a drive-thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~5 years ago~HORRIBLE! First let me say, I have made friends with almost everyone at 19th and tbird and 31st and Peoria and have most of them as friends on fb so I know it's not me. I have been to this location many times and never really had an issue.. Until today. I had asked if she could make my sandwich after our drinks were made so it would be hot. So of course she put it in first and then placed our drink order. I just brushed it off thinking that she'll make our drinks since no one else was in line but she just stood there until a line formed taking their orders. The supervisor Cheri  (she's the blonde chick who's style is kind of like a pin up) comes out from the back, sees the line and us, and leaves again. Now I'm getting a little annoyed. She finally comes back and starts throwing lids and things around and you can feel the negative energy. I remember this chick from before and she's always had a bad attitude. We finally get our drinks and I just let the barista know that I had wanted my sandwich made after but didn't make a huge deal out of it. That's when Cheri decides it's finally time to release all of that obvious anger she's been holding in and starts talking shit. I don't say anything and we leave. She is a very rude person and I know her type(works in customer service but doesn't want to drop her attitude). I know I can't be the only one who's noticed (ie other customers and I'm sure employees/corporate). She needs an attitude adjustment. Working customer service you do not act like that.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Aug 28, 2016~I normally love this Starbucks and would probably rate it a 4, but today's service Sunday afternoon was so shocking, I'd like to make the point with 1 star. The barista who took my order was so incredibly rude asking me to `"hurry up`" because she had customers when the place was almost empty and there was only one person behind me in the queue who was still looking and asked me to take my time.  An elderly lady in front of me had asked me a question and I was taking the time to answer. It was a beautiful Sunday and this kind of friendly talk among customers is the kind of thing that makes a Starbucks a local hangout that justifies the $4 price tag for the coffee. There was noone pressuring this barista who felt compelled to be snippy and give one liner retorts as though she had some place better to be. The place remained almost empty the remainder of the Sunday and no wonder.  Perhaps she had too much coffee, but she could really learn to chill and help create the friendly atmosphere that makes the shop a worthy Sunday destination. If the customers are cool and relaxed, what's this woman's problem?  I think I'll try LUX just 10 minutes away on Central.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Feb 7, 2024~Make my drink correctly! More than 50% of the time my drink is made wrong... The manager even told me to change my name to `"no milk`" and somehow I still get milk in my drink :-/
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jan 22, 2024~This Starbucks on 27th Ave is the best!  In Dec when they were closed for remodeling I was forced to go to another location on HV Rd and was reminded of how this place is awesome!  The friendly customer service, always getting my order correct and how streamlined they are.  Always friendly customer service, thank you for that!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jun 16, 2023~The Starbucks crew at 27th Ave., and West Agua Fria in the the target store are simply the best! They remembered my birthday. I might go in there a little too often! They all signed a card and gave me flowers. They are absolutely the best, and make me feel so loved!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Sep 23, 2023~Terrible drinks inside target Starbucks. Barista did not make any of our shaken espresso drinks correctly. I asked the barista if it was the right drink as it was too sweet and he did nothing to try and fix it. Won't be coming back here again.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~May 9, 2023~Best Target Starbucks I have ever been too. Very clean, open, great staff, fast service and made me feel like I was a local.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jul 29, 2019~Delicious drink made by the server!!! I always forget to get the names of the servers but I appreciate them a ton! She made my drink really good, I got a Venti vanilla bean frap blended with blackberry &amp; straw berry infusions! Blended with extra ice and cinnamon dolce powder, caramel drizzle in cup and then add whip and caramel on top :)Always have the best service when I come to this Starbucks location in Target, definitely my go to in the area!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 20, 2018~Yet another starbucks because of my wife. This is at best location. Next to AMC and well maintained like majority of stores. It has enough seating as well. Nice coffee next door. They do happy hour and season special drinks as well. So full fledged I would say.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Sep 14, 2020~Jess at this Starbucks was so friendly and quick! Our drinks were delicious and I appreciate the fact that she talked with my daughters along side of me, that's hard to find!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Nov 3, 2022~As an Uber eats driver I experience bad service here and there. And even at this location a couple times. But today I didn't appreciate the kind of service I got today with Kristen. Who was handling delivery orders this morning. I went in to spoke with her and told her what name I was there for. She told me it would be a few minutes. I noticed she looked at me several times as I waited on the order. The order had one drink and one food item. I waited almost 15 minutes until I finally went up to speak to Kristen about an update on the order. Her helper pointed out the order was the one and only bag that was already prepared and ready just sitting there for at least 10 minutes. When I asked Kristen if she knew the order was there the whole time and she just shrugged her shoulders and rolled her eyes. I was the African American in there and I can't help but feel racially discriminated against. I will not be coming back to deliver or pickup for this location and I will be notifying Uber as well.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Aug 10, 2019~This place needs a serious manager who knows what they are doing I walked in and first notice that the new cups are stored hard up against a trash bin. Physically touching.  So apparently they dont care much about sanitation.  Maybe the dept of health will. I dunno.  Second.  I was the only one in line.  Everyone else in there had a drink and was seated.  I ordered.  The barista made a drink.  Not mine.  Made another drink. Not mine.  Made a THIRD drink. Not mine. Mind you.  I was THE ONLY ONE THERE.   How are you making three drinks while staring at the person who just ordered and waiting for his?  Customer service isnt a thing?  We're just robots making things in senseless order?  Again I circle back to poor management failing to give its team proper direction.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 27, 2018~Simple, kind, accommodating service. Inside of a Target to deal with crazy Holiday shopping. Stephanie stayed on top of coffee rhythm. She's great and she could move like lightening.   Another pleasant holiday experience!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Dec 9, 2024~Monday morning 6 AM the barista with the long, thick brown hair needs to not have an attitude when she makes drinks wrong!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Mar 19, 2024~The staff was friendly but it was a 20 minute wait for coffee. The interior is tiny and crowded. The tables come out on arms from the wall and are really uncomfortable if you need to work while you wait. Id probably skip this location in the future.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Aug 11, 2024~I love Starbucks but NOT this one. Omg... line always takes forever. Got extremely sick from them adding the wrong milk at least twice. Rude drive through. Never again. 0 stars
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Aug 9, 2024~We just picked up our drinks from Starbucks and we are very disappointed. The curly hair girl at the window said that we needed to give more time from when we placed the order to come for pick up. Keep in mind we came after the suggested time.Also my wife's drink didn't have an ingredient she asked for and mine was not blended/ had enough ice and lacked flavor.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Sep 20, 2024~They would rather rush through drive-thru orders than make it right. This has happened multiple times to me at the location. I ordered a hot vanilla latte and got milk with a shot of coffee and syrup. They can't even take the time to steam drinks. This morning was the fifth time, and I'm just done with this place.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Feb 27, 2023~This is a drive through ONLY Starbucks that even with long lines, doesn't take a lot of time. I found myself at the end and it took about 5 minutes to get my drink. The service is kind and good. The drinks are always good.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Feb 4, 2024~I'm truly a patient person, with the exception of grabbing a coffee before work when I only have 5 minutes to spare but this Starbucks so incredibly slow. The line is always very long. The staff is very friendly though. The ambiance in the inside is nice with the updates. Two stars for that. I know good things take time but on average I'm in line for about 15+ mins. I'm writing this while waiting in line. But friendly staff! Yay there.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jul 2, 2021~We swung in here on the way home from our staycation for a potty break and a treat. It was a nice spacious clean location. My husband got his Nitro Cold Brew. The girls got their strawberry and chocolate Frappuccinos that were made perfectly and look so yummy! Service was super super friendly. The drinks were made fast. Their bathroom has a security lock code on their door. Thank goodness it was clean and had plenty of paper products including potty protectors.A great experience to end our mini stayca  in town.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~May 10, 2024~Always. Tried one of the other ones, but definitely back to starbucks, they are truly my personal assistance!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Apr 27, 2024~I don't care about waiting, which is a given when they're busy, but to go through drive thru getting a bacon gouda sandwich and then getting all the way home and it has no bacon on it.  So I return to get a new one and the girls there are snotty and not friendly at all.  Especially the one making all of the sandwiches in the oven, she does not appear to like her job at all.  No sorry, no, thank you.  Nothing.  Customer service apparently isn't their forte and I will never tip them again.   Not that they care, apparently.  If I could give less than one star, I would.  They don't care about their customers or their mistakes.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Nov 18, 2023~Waited in the drive through line for 15 minutes and they managed to serve two cars. I watched people pull out of line to walk inside for service and come back out before the line moved at all. Eventually myself and several others gave up and left. I try and avoid this location as they are usually exceptionally slow or inaccurate in drinks but today it was the most convenient choice. I could have driven to another location further away and at least gotten my drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Feb 4, 2024~Service is awful at this location. Unfortunately drinks and food aren't good quality either. Store is very empty but somehow always messy.. would recommend going to the target across the street and using their Starbucks, they have much better customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Mar 20, 2023~5 stars for the customer service, every time I come to this location they're always so friendly and nice. Not as busy as other Starbucks I've been to but even if there's a long line of cars it goes by pretty fast. I definitely would recommend this location!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Dec 7, 2019~I get it, it's a Starbucks in Deer Valley. Ton's of office buildings, thousands of workers and its the only drive-through Starbucks in the area. Despite the numerous times I have checked in here, my son goes to a specialist nearby and its the only place that has a holiday drink that I like at the moment. Why did I rate this place so low? It's because it's very and I mean very inconsistent when it comes to waiting times and drinks. I walked inside the other week thinking `"Well the drive-through is long so I guess I should go inside`" Nope... For the first time in history going inside the lobby to order your drink was much slower. When I mean much slower, it took 15 minutes to get my drink. The few times I been here they always forget to add flavor to my drink so I get a blank Almond milk iced blonde latte instead of vanilla or chestnut praline (first world problems right) They do have a table with coloring books if your coming with your kid...or if you need something to do while waiting the 20 minutes it takes for your coffee. I only gave this place 2 stars because the one lady who works the drive-through (the older blonde lady) is the nicest and most caring worker there. The other week I had one worker give me an attitude cause she thought my name was `"Arkada`" instead of Arlina and accused me of trying to take my own drink. When I told her exactly the customization was in the drink was when she decided to hand it over and guess what...it was still wrong. If you don't need a blonde roast and you work in this area, your better off going inside the Starbucks in Target. If your near Happy Valley Road, just go to the Starbucks there.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jul 6, 2021~Tuesday, July 6, 2021 @ 5:30pm Attention District Manager:Why is this a service challenged location? You had 5 employees working &amp; no one wanted to acknowledge us standing in line - why?
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Oct 22, 2023~Customer service is excellent:) My order is a bit complicated due to my allergies and they nail it every time and put love into their drinks. Never had issues, they manage to get the line moving and still provide good drinks in a timely manner. Great management.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Jan 3, 2023~Service is fine people are nice and definitely keep things moving.  But CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN why I wait 10 min for a drip coffee.  Back in the day (10 months ago in this case) they would turn around and put coffee in a cup and 45 seconds I was on my way.  Seriously what the serious F!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Nov 24, 2018~Last trip here.  Though convienent to where I work I have had the following experiences; waited 30 min for a coffee, ordered through app and coffee was wrong, called they were nice said I could get this replaced the next time I'm in well that would have been great if they weren't out of what I wanted.  Really?  Oh and then it's the little things, no stoppers.  I'm in supply chain order what you Update: I think they finally have things figured out!  Changing to two stars until I know for sure.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 18, 2017~Last trip here.  Though convenient to where I work I have had the following experiences; waited 30 min for a coffee, ordered through app and coffee was wrong, called they were nice said I could get this replaced the next time I'm in well that would have been great if they weren't out of what I wanted.  Really?  Oh and then it's the little things, no stoppers.  I'm in supply chain order what you need.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Nov 17, 2021~It's your stereotypical overpriced drink place. The employees seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with orders. What's cool is that they have one of my favorite brands of juice being sold here: Evolution Fresh. Unfortunately, it costs around 37% more than if you were to buy it at a grocery store. It looks like my favorite drink, matcha green tea frappuccino, is a part of a secret menu because it isn't listed on the store menu. The employees were nice while there though.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Mar 24, 2023~We always love getting coffee here before our nail appointment. The cafe IS open for dining and seating, they are always friendly, and very quick getting orders through.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Mar 24, 2018~This Starbucks gets pretty packed sometimes. There's not a lot of parking. There is 2 other Starbucks in the area which is good cause it's a busy business area. There's a patio outside. When it's summer they turn on the mist to help cool off. I love the caramel frappacino. My sister loves the vanilla bean frappacino.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Feb 24, 2022~I like Starbucks but they tend to never get my order right. Not sure if their headset in the drive through is broken or what but I find it frustrating every time I ask for 1 pump of syrup they also default to their stores 4 pumps lol
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Feb 14, 2023~I have been coming to this location for 4-8 plus years. I typically get the same drink every time. Well yesterday morning I came in and due to issues with My BP I switched my drink up. So when I got there I went to the register and confirmed my drink was decaf vs caffeinated. To my surprise the batista advised me that my mobile order had not come through, but no big deal she will put it in. In the meantime I located where the order went, called them and canceled, but they still charged me since it was a mobile order. Now I'm back speaking to the young lady helping me who was very nice and empathic. Another barista comes up with a mean look and attitude ugh no she has to pay. I asked why that I had already paid and with a very condescending tone it's a fry's we don't get that money. They are not a Starbucks. I said ok, I did not know that. how would I request a refund no and she just walked away. So I paid another 6 dollars for a coffee fine... I walk over to wait frustrated. I hit my vape, she very rudely says don't vape in MY store. Which is not a big deal, but the tone and shitiness. My feelings were hurt and I was just confused by the treatment. I said can we not be a **** to me please. When I grabbed my coffee and asked why she was so rude.  The other  worker said I'm sorry I didn't catch the full thing. I just left Thinking wow that was awful. This rude employee teegan has been there 6 months rarely smiling always looks upset. every morning she gives dirty looks, management has made it very clear that her behavior is completely acceptable and I can just screw off. This is the worst part. I walk in this morning and Craig, whom I have never once seen at the store walks up rudely interrupts my phone call even when holding up my hand gesturing give me a minute he proceeds to talk, resulting in me needing to hang my phone up. He tells me I am no longer able to get my coffee there. I can agree I should have not used a cruise word SINGULAR ONE Which was not directly to her just simply asking her not to be **** to me. Brought tears to my eyes. I go in every day. last year I got all the employees a Christmas card with a gift card. I dropped a 100 in their tip jar just because. I have left with incorrect coffees and chose to not say anything because they were slammed. Maybe if craig was there checking on his staff this would have never happened. I even tried to have a conversation with him afterwards and he refused to have any type of logical or rational conversation with me.My final outcome with his boss is that I don't meet Starbucks values, but not to worry I can still give them my money at other locations........ So I am valuable enough to spend my money at other locations but not good enough to spend my money at the closest Starbucks to my house that I have managed to goto for 8 years with no issues at all. Everyone has bad days, nobody's perfect. I Am appalled by how this was handled. I go in every morning. I ignore her dirty looks, eye rolls and nasty/ hurtful comments she has made under her breath and finally I had enough. if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, I'm going to call it a duck. I stood up for myself wrong to have used a swear word yes. no excuse, however the way it was handled is absolutely rotten, hurtful and has made me feel like I deserved the way I was treated..is this management or punish the customer because their spoke to his manager and she was even worse.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Mar 5, 2020~Today I placed a mobile order for four drinks and two of the drinks I had ordered them with no ice, apparently they did not look at the ticket order because they filled both of those drinks to the top with ice.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Mar 11, 2022~The young woman at the window with black hair usually in a pony tail is SO SWEET. She knows me by name at this point and makes the whole experience great! Great location all around and always gets my order right! -Catherine
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 10, 2021~This location was a good location a couple years ago before the new manager got rid of all the old staff and brought a bunch of people in who have no idea what they are doing! Every time I've been to this location my drink is made wrong somehow it's aggravating because this is the Starbucks by my house and i can't even go to it without wasting my money because my order is messed up. Josh with the red hair is the best tho! Other than that the general manager here is disrespectful and gives terrible service! Don't even waste your time.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jul 5, 2017~This location had changed soooo much since they first opened. The service is great, staff is friendly and drinks come out quick and correct. Applause for sure. Please get someone to fix the enormous pot hole in the drive where you turn in.

Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Dec 2, 2016~I put the following review below. Since then I would like to say this location has improved greatly. The wait time on a drink is now average for starbucks times. The drinks have also gotten better.This location is the worst location for time, you can easily spend 20 to 30 minutes just trying to get one drink and I'm talking every single time. I have even tried pre-ordering my drink online through the mobile app and have issues. If you dont have more that 15 minutes to wait don't go through the drive-thru. Go across the street to the Starbucks at Target or in the shopping plaza you'll be in and out, just no drive thru's there. My drinks are 50/50 on the quality. Never really get food.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Nov 16, 2022~I really try to give people the benefit of the doubt as my husband worked for Starbucks for many years. However, on several occasions I have mobile ordered and nearly 30 min later my order is still not ready. The estimated pick up time really needs to be more accurate.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~May 13, 2022~I don't recommend this actual location itself. I'm leaving a review because I can't reach anybody at the location. Just went through the drive through it's the closest starbs by my house. I've been going here for years. As well as my friends and family. I'm not the only one whom has had terrible services and well this morning. I just had the worst experience in the drive through. The drink that I usually order I know what it looks like I've been ordering it for a long time. There for I know what it taste/looks like. It wasn't that. It tasted gross with carmel in the foam as I asked for NO carmel so I turned to tell the lady that gave me my drink, and tried telling her this doesn't taste like... she immediately snatches the coffee out of my hands and she wouldn't even let me finish telling her what was wrong with it. Then she rudely handed me another drink that looked  more like the drink I ordered, but it tasted the same as the other one I had just handed back! I'm DONE with this location and the rude people whom work here. Where is the customer service now days? There was 2 sweet girls there always but I haven't seen either of them the last few times I've gone. Also I'm throwing my coffee out!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 11, 2022~These negative reviews seem a bit harsh, if you place a mobile order ahead of time you won't have any problem just picking up your drink and leaving. I picked up my drink at 11:10 and was out in the same minute. It is a smaller location, so the parking lot is tricky along with a very long drive thru line. But the workers are helpful, and quick. It was very busy! But they handle it well.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Oct 18, 2022~Horrible!! I come in here almost every single day with mobile order. A majority of the morning crew knows me by name and my order. I'm an ex partner so 99% of the time I'm understanding. Today I went in to the lobby to order a couple of drinks at 10:51a. It was 11:07 when I finally decided to say something to the girl with the Medusa piercing. She was blatantly ignoring me and never acknowledged me. No one in the entire time I stood there asked me if I was waiting for drinks. I said excuse me to MELISSA and she didn't even look up at me. She then proceeded to tell me that my order went in at 10:51 and that I had not been waiting for 17minutes. I told her to check the time and she said it's 11:08. They always complain to me bout how they have crazy customers come in and now I see why. The girls that work here get flustered when they are busy and are so rude to customers countless of times. If you don't like making coffee in a busy coffee shop go work somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Feb 8, 2019~Well Here I am again at yet another Starbucks of course that's me I had to stop that just about every Starbucks and have my special tea drinks. Now being contrary to popular belief I do not drink coffee all day long in fact when I go to Starbucks 95% of my purchases are either ice Chai latte or ice refreshing drinks which are really good as always I do have to give a 5 star because it's Starbucks after all.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 11, 2020~This Starbucks is close to my house and I usually get coffee before work using the mobile app. My coffee has always been ready before or when I get there. All of the staff I've interacted with are super sweet and professional. Today (Veteran's Day) I waited 30 minutes for my coffee because they were so so slammed. I was late to work yesterday for this reason. 5 stars still for me because today the pick up window barista was working SO hard to accommodate mobile orders and walk-in orders. They were seemingly printing out of her machine by the dozen. There were many guests surrounding the counter and she maintained her composure and fast-pace, continually apologizing and thanking people for their patience. I love that attitude. I do kind of wish there was a `"come back later`" voucher or something on the mobile app. With the unpredictable business of this Starbucks, I think it might help employees and customers alike. With three ways to order, drive-thru, mobile (and Uber) and in-person, volume can just build up so fast without the customers or employees knowing what they're in for.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Mar 20, 2017~Not a big fan of Starbucks until recently, this was my first visit to this location.I used to stay away from Starbucks because I try to do low-carb and even their sugar free beverages may end up having tons of them.Recently learned to place orders online, and I placed my 4th mobile order here. I highly recommend mobile order, if you give them the 10 minutes or so, some stores have your beverage ready for you to just pick up, others have a sign to ask for it.Here they had a sign, and Jacob was very friendly and professional, he provided my drink and made sure to ask if everything was OK, he even added more whipped cream for me.This time I decided to try the Misto option (half coffee, half steamed mild).It tastes great (great find!). I did park and walked in to pick up my order, but this location has limited and funny parking, there was a tree in the middle of the parking lot, not sure if it recently fell, or it has grown wild and no one cares.Drive thru highly recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jul 1, 2022~Omg just absolutely terrible service, extremely slow. Go to the next one that's closer to you
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Oct 19, 2018~Eight people working15 people waiting for coffee drinks Worst Starbucks customer service in the World!Entire staff is slow and unorganized!At $6 per cup... you would expect excellence!Get it together Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jul 21, 2019~Lost my back pack here and called 3 days after, they said they 'through it out'...weird that a place throughs a out lost and found in a such a short amount of time (especially sense it was an expensive back pack)...asked the manager about it on the phone but she was too busy to call me and then never called me back...i just don't trust this place. ENTER AT OWN RISK*Hope this helped
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Nov 6, 2018~This Starbucks rocks! I come here a couple of times a week to decompress and read. Some of the baristas know me by name and know my order based on the time of the day I come in. Sometimes it can get really busy during the lunch rush so try to avoid coming in around that time!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Aug 20, 2020~I regret every time I come to this Starbucks so freaking slow. In driv thru 15 min and still have to cars in front. Last time I will come to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Aug 11, 2018~I liked that this one is drive thru! It's very convenient when you have kids and don't want to drag them into a store. They were quick and the baristas were nice. Not a bad experience at all!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Apr 4, 2022~Went in to pickup an order. Noticed one gentleman with a mean look on his face. Noticed he gave horrible service to those he serviced. When I mentioned it to another employee and told him he should smile, they ignored me and told me to have a nice day. So no I don't recommend this location to anyone.The only Starbucks in the valley I have issues with. Management should be aware.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Mar 1, 2021~Iced caramel macchiato with no caramel ? Frap was also flavorless, tasted more like water than coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 2, 2020~Don't Uber eats from this location. No matter what you order it's wrong every time. I ordered a venti Carmel macchiato today with 2 extra shots, 2 Carmel syrup pumps, Carmel drizzle and whip. Nothing! Just coffee. $15.36 for a coffee to be ubered 1.5 miles away. Someone needs to learn to read at this store because last time I ordered this drink I got a iced one instead! Can't read the Extra Hot on the label huh? Refunds mean nothing except that I won't be waking up with my espresso this am. I'm done ordering from here. If your going to be prepared for dissatisfaction for sure. There are 3 other locations that are better. 2500 Happy Valley Rd, and the two at Deer Valley Center.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jul 11, 2017~Wow. Slowest Starbucks I've ever been to in my life. Unless you're the only one here waiting for a drink, plan on waiting at least 15 minutes. The inside of the building is nice and everything, but don't ever come here if you're in a hurry or you'll be extremely frustrated!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Mar 26, 2017~This is a really nice Starbucks! Usually Starbucks feels a bit cramped and small, but this one has a lot of open space to walk and to wait for drinks. My iced caramel macchiato only took about 1 minute to come out! This location has a drive through and a ton of covered patio seating outside. It's located in a nice area with wide roads and limited traffic and congestion. I'm so happy that I live only 1.0 miles from here!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 13, 2017~I usually come here almost every morning and I always order ahead my orders are always correct and ready for me, staff is always friendly and it's always clean. My drinks are always great and I've had some of the food as well everything has been good. It does get busy and the parking gets full pretty quick but I'm usually in and out with no hold up
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Dec 26, 2019~I'm giving two stars because they haven't ever messed up my order, but customer service I am pretty disappointed. I had a issue with debit card being left at a drive threw. I wasn't really expecting anything from them but a little apology for also their mistake (yes I'm at fault too) but they made it like it was such a horrible inconvenience for them, even though I had to drive back 25 minutes back to get it. I understand they are busy but there is a serious lack of customer service, this isn't the only instance. This is just current and finally fed up. Will go to a different store.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jun 3, 2017~Big Starbucks. Friendly folks. Lots of parking and lots of room outside at this one. Definitely one of the better Starbucks in the area. Good for large groups or meetings too.... and Michael makes an awesome French press! If you haven't ever tried one you should. Its Sublime!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~May 29, 2019~I think local Starbucks are feeling the sting of Dutch Bros competition. Face to face employees have a much improved demeanor although it's glaringly fake. That's fine though, snobby Starbucks baristas never bothered me before and they always got the drinks right. Since the attempt to be friendlier had been pushed my order hasn't been right a single time. My order is actually pretty simple, cold foam cold brew add cream and hazelnut. Give me back the begrudgingly accurate barisatas please.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Aug 17, 2019~Great customer service and fast service as well. Accidentally ordered drink from wrong location when I showed up here they just made me same drink without extra charge.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 13, 2016~I am almost certain this is the Starbucks of the reject baristas. I have been to a ton of Starbucks all over the valley and the United States. I have NEVER had such in incompetent baristas. They always ask dumb questions or even just make the order wrong. For instance I asked for extra hazelnut typically they just do extra no questions asked. However at this Starbucks they ask how many pumps do you want? Like I have worked there before and know the recipe. Also I ordered a ice Carmel coffee. He handed it to me and it looked very dark. I tasted it and it had no cream in it. When I asked why is there no cream he replied that I didn't ask for it. I have never had to ask for cream before. Another time while pregnant I asked for it to be decaf and they told me they can't do decaf ice coffee. I have ordered this also in the past no problem. It doesn't take rocket science to know instead of icing a caffeinated coffee you just ice a decaf . I am done giving this place a chance every time it's a whole go around for just a simple order. I'll get my butt out of the car and go to the Starbucks in target across the street.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Oct 10, 2020~Stuck in a drive through line of 30 minutes!!! Come on it's coffee people. I am an idiot for waiting,  but once you're in the line your stuck and cannot get out. Last time I come into this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~May 4, 2016~Wow... Worst Starbucks experience EVER. No one greeted me. I was the only person at the register and it took four minutes for anyone to even acknowledge that I was standing there waiting to order. In that time, two people were told to attend to me yet no one came over or said hello.  I counted four people working.Upon ordering two drinks, the Americano arrived lukewarm after five minutes. I waited another two minutes before asking where my Frappacino was. No one had even thought to start it. It took an additional ten minutes for them to finish my drink order. The Frappacino wasn't full to the top, so they loaded it with whip cream. The dome cap was a waste of resources because there was nothing for it to dome over.I paid almost $9.00 for two drinks and hated every moment of the experience in addition to being disappointed with the outcome.BUCK UP AND GET ORGANIZED OVER THERE!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 21, 2018~This is, without a doubt, the slowest Starbucks in the state of Arizona. Possibly the slowest in America. Unless you have an extra 20-30 minutes to wait for your drink, I don't recommend this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Sep 9, 2018~I am very disappointed in the service and drinks from this location. I had a mobile order that they hid behind the counter. I waited for 8 minutes before I asked if they had started my drinks. Not one barista asked me what I was waiting for. They had the drinks ready behind the counter which I could not see. When they gave them to me 2 drinks were incorrect. I didn't notice until I got in the car. So I had to drive back and have them remake the drinks. The barista that remade my drink did a horrible job. It was a hot grande drink that he only filled about 12oz. So not only did I have to wait a long time, get drinks remade, and still didn't get a decent drink, they did nothing to try and make up for their mistakes.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Jun 9, 2016~This place is just okay. There really is a different experience between drive thru and ordering inside. I can't really tell which one is slower though. You figure when you order 2 drinks, they come out at the same time but no, I got my first drink then 5-6 mins later my second one came out. The batista taking my order barely said a thing. Just the usual 'what can I get for you' and just okays and stuff after. The annoying part about any establishment is when they assume you are done ordering. Ask `"would there be anything else today`" rather than give me my total. I usually go through the drive thru and drinks and pretty quick, the only thing that takes long are the people in front of you. Starbucks can't control how long it takes someone to order so I won't hold that against the place. I think the mistake may be having mobile ordering. When an order comes through,  it's like all work stops on everyone's orders who are actually at the building so that they can make the online order first. I understand the concept, people like their things quick, but if it makes one customer happy but irritates everyone else who's been in line, is it actually worth it? I saw probably 3 or 4 people get their online orders after I had been sitting there for some time waiting. Some staff is friendly, some is not. The first person I ran into here today was the manager as soon as I walked in the door and she just kind of looked at me as she sped passed even tho i made an effort to smile at her. She was stocking or whatever she was doing. So I guess she was too busy. I do like Starbucks and have yet to have an order messed up so of course I'll be back. I just want you guys to step up your game, if not in speed of service, maybe customer service so we actually enjoy the fact we have to wait 10-15 minutes for our order.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 14, 2018~I tried using my samsung pay but the associate waa not familiar with their machine as to where to place the phone, all the while shes sighing and rolling her eyes.  The next customer was paying with applepay, same attitude. Very rude customer service. Age made have paid a factor but be knowledgeable
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 19, 2016~This is the slowest Starbucks I've ever been too. The drive through takes 15+ minutes no matter what time of day. And inside is even worse. Please don't make this your morning stop if you are on a time crunch. And secondly this is probably a bunch of the most uneducated group of baristas I've ever met. And they aren't even nice to top it off. Please Avoid this Starbucks till get better baristas that care about quality and speed. Because right now this team has neither
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Oct 26, 2018~Three separate team members told me they'd `"be right with me`" and then continued to serve customers in the drive through line. If you drive into this location you're golden, but if you walk in then prepare to go thirsty.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Aug 30, 2019~I go into this store pretty often and especially on happy hours. Everytime I have gone they always get my drinks out quickly and are friendly. I went into this store yesterday for their happy hour and couldnt help but notice there was only 5 of them working their fastest. I mentioned how difficult is must be getting all those drinks out with so few of them in which one of the girls responded `"we try our best`" with a smile. They got all 4 of my drinks out in the cafe fast but I still felt really bad for how hard they were all working. I hope they get more staffing for the next happy hour for their sakes. Thank you awesome baristas!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Nov 22, 2018~This is BY FAR the worst Starbucks. There's always a long wait with the people taking their time to make the drinks. Today it was a 22 minute wait. (This was a mobile order too) I started avoiding it and going to the new one on 32nd st and union hills when I can. But I would recommend only going to this Starbucks if you have time for about a 20 minute wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Apr 3, 2019~(Update!) I walked in the following day to get a sandwich and mentioned my coffee episode from the day before, and the manager overheard me talking to the cashier, gave me a cold brew for free today and rushed it out. This is great! I have to acknowledge that while I had a bad experience yesterday, they made up for it today. (Yesterday's review) I've been to this Starbucks several times as it is close to my house with few problems. But today I walked in to get a coffee quick before work. I walked right up to the register, ordered a cold brew (not a time consuming drink), and stood there 10 minutes without them making it. I was late and there was no sign of them making it so I just left. I work in the service industry so I know I'm not the only customer they had, but the cashier was just standing there watching the two guys make drinks and they were obviously behind. So I'm out $5 today, late for work and have no coffee.

Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Oct 19, 2020~Way too long to get through the drive through. I have been sitting in the line for 20 minutes already with 11 cars ahead of me. Won't be back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Oct 9, 2019~I have no idea why this Starbucks is rated this low. I actually go out of my way to this location because the service is amazing! They are always so friendly and quick, they have never gotten my order wrong, and they really are a great start to my morning.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Sep 11, 2018~This location makes the worst drinks. Absolutely no consistency. At least one time a week they mess up my drink order....and I don't have time in the morning to go back so they can fix their mistake. I'm going back to Dutch Bros!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jun 2, 2019~Not super close to me but I drive the extra 15 min because the staff is always professional and very nice. Thanks Keri and Hadley.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Mar 7, 2016~Nice Starbucks. New store. But the WiFi is totally fracked. Never seen speeds this slow. Ever. Something very wrong.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 30, 2018~The worst experience I've ever had at a Starbucks. They aren't even busy and they forgot my order twice. The drinks came out as expected as we patiently waited for our food order. After about 5 min I asked about our order, I could see a bagel sitting out but no one was even preparing the sandwich. They then gave me the bagel which was not toasted as ordered and barely warm. They said the sandwich was on its way. A few minutes later we inquired about the sandwich to find out they totally forgot about it. They did refund our order but it doesn't change how I was made to feel. Frustrated by the lack of common courtesy and follow through. It was obvious that the drive through was given the priority, I was made to feel like I was an interruption.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Nov 8, 2018~So today I went to starbuck's drive thru as I do almost everyday.It was taking a bit longer, was getting mad. When I get to the order box as always Melissa's nice voice was on and was very apologetic saying that both of their machines were down, sorry that they was taking a little longer as well as offering lots of options for me. I ended up with a coffee with my pumpkin spice in it and all the stuff that normally goes on my drink with half milk steamed, it wasn't half bad, I was pleased with it. The only thing that would of made it better, if it had been free. Not sure she had the authority to do so all I know is I was mad until I heard her letting me know what was going on. Thanks for making sure I got my caffeine fix one way or another.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Aug 4, 2017~The Girls here are super nice Shout out To Melissa!! And Maryann they are super in drive thru.Melissa so glad to see your back in the window yesterday we missed you on Wednesday we waited 20 mins my boss and I both said Thursday so glad she was back in window today, love your bubbly spirt and your speed of service. We just wish you worked more.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~May 22, 2016~I'm torn between the stars. During the week this Starbucks is pretty quick and very pleasant. On the weekends, the staff is rude, doesn't care about orders and I literally wait in the drive thru for 20 minutes waiting to order and get my drink. I just visited this location today and when I pulled up my drink wasn't even ready. The guy handed me my drink 3-5 mins later and the waffle cone frap topping was missing. When I asked him about it his response  was `"oh this was a waffle cone frap?`" Really?!?! My drink doesn't taste good AT ALL.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jan 4, 2020~I just got the worst guava white tea ever. Didn't taste until I got to work. No guava flavor at all!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 14, 2015~I am beyond stoked that this location was opened! I'm definitely a frequent visitor.  Service is excellent too!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 2, 2016~Unfortunately you will not be seeing the customer service at this location that Starbucks is known for. I waited in line about 30 minutes and had to repeat my entire order to the cashier at least three times over. When I finally got to the front and pulled my $20 bill out it ripped in half but they refused to take it. even though he spoke to the manager. It wasn't like I had a handful of pennies! most restaurants have some tape for the rare occasions when a bill tears. It really sucked because I waited so long for my peppermint mocha. I actually had to go to the bank and get another $20 and come back. I went inside to tell the manager.( she was the one who actually refused to take it) from now on I will definitely be using ANY other Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 8, 2019~Got my order wrong. Cashier didn't really care, gave me a different price at the menu than what I got when I got to the drive through window to pay. Customer service could be better
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Sep 19, 2017~Always out of ingredients for drinks, I've come to this location countless times on my way to work with a mobile order, and I'm not sure why it took me so long to realize I just need to go to a different location, because I'll wait around for 10 minutes before asking where my mobile order is, at which point they'll claim they were trying to let me know they were out of that drink (but really just continued to make others drinks, see me standing there, and not say anything). I think it's unbelievable that before 10 am you're out of ingredients. I'm never coming to this Starbucks again. Tell whoever does your orders to order more.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Apr 7, 2017~This is the SLOWEST Starbucks I have ever been to.Holy cow, I get so bored waiting in line or in the drive thru. I have never waited less than 15-20 minutes in this drive thru, I always have to make sure I have extra time if I want coffee from here. The baristas are super nice when you pre-order, but make sure you speak up and let them know you are there, otherwise you will be standing there forever.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 10, 2019~Slowest Starbucks I've ever been to. Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes for your order almost every time. Doing a mobile order does not speed things up
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 11, 2017~This Starbucks never ever gets my order right ever. No matter what I order they never pay attention and give me the wrong item.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Aug 15, 2016~Slowest. Drive thru. Ever. I try not to make a judgment based on one experience so this was my second time going through the drive through and I literally put my car in park while I was waiting, both times, it was that slow. Not sure why. But 2/2 means I'm going somewhere else. Also the first time I went they royally messed up my drink and nearly made me diabetic with the sweetener. Thankfully I tasted it before I pulled away. Hopefully they get their act together there!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~May 16, 2016~I work really close to this, so my co-workers and I go here often, there has not been a nice experience in this Starbucks ever! They have made my drink wrong so many times that at this point I expect them to have to re make it every time. I has not written a revue because they are so new I was giving them a chance to get over the learning curve, but after 3 solids months and today's experience I have had it! I purchase a simple teva tea this morning, I walked over this afternoon, and just wanted more hot water.. Which they wanted to charge me again for the tea!! This does not happen at any other Starbucks! Not to mention that baristas are not friendly, they have 5-7 people and it took us 30 minutes to get 4 drinks! Don't come to this Starbucks if you want good customer service, because you won't find it!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Oct 17, 2015~The baristas are friendly and the store is always clean. Love having a new fast drive thru in the area! Huge patio is a plus as the weather cools down
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~May 18, 2016~Very rare that I complain but within the last 3 weeks the service has become so careless along with uncaring. I work in this industry and am a little more forgiving when things are not perfect BUT when I have pointed out several times that I have not received my food or drink while 5 people behind me have received everything and are on their way while I wait for my tea and pumkin loaf...unacceptable. Last time I come here, will save me 15 min of my day. :(
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Dec 19, 2016~I love the baristas here...  contrary to what I've read, I've never had any of the baristas be rude to me.  This is a VERY busy location so expect a wait time from morning to about noon.  To avoid the rush, I usually use their mobile ordering option on my way to work and pick it up at this location...  and it's 95% of the time always ready for me when I walk in.  I absolutely recommend mobile ordering to cut on the wait time, just give yourself 10-15 min before pick up. Also, if you order the wrong thing or they don't have a food item you ordered, be aware they can't give you refund because you technically didn't pay for it there... if they can't accommodate you with a different item then you will need to call the 800# and request one.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Aug 31, 2019~Love the staff, very friendly !!! The drive thru is very quick no matter how long the line is!!! Love their Matcha with soy milk, as well as their Iced teas!!! Heaven on Earth!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Aug 2, 2019~I went to this Starbucks before 8:30 and went through drive through but no one acknowledged me so I looked online to see what time it closed at but they didn't close until 9. I drove to the window and there was a girl who looked at us and then went to lock the window. While I was trying to get her attention a young man appeared to tell us that they're close but I told them that online it says they don't close until 9.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 10, 2016~Never been pleased with this location but today was really the last straw. I've had rude employees who look and sound like they hate their job. And before, it was small slip ups, like they missed an extra pump of caramel or they pushed my second drink down the line and I had to wait twice as long. But today they completely messed up my drink order; it's no where near what I ordered. And when she called it out, she said it correctly. It's written on the cup correctly. But it's no where near what I ordered and I am no longer going to come to this location. Sorry, but I think a retraining needs to happen.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Jun 12, 2016~Typical Starbucks: good coffee and snacks. Lines are normally long if u come in the morning. One nice thing about this Starbucks  is that it has outside seating with misters.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 20, 2015~If anyone writes this place a bad review, please just give them more coffee :) the workers in this place are the biggest sweethearts !! I go in here a lot with tons of orders and they have all the patience in the world when I'm ordering. And they're super fast. Def one of my favorite spots !
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Feb 26, 2016~This is my local/fave Starbucks. They got mobile order on point. Just like any of your local B-Bucks, it can get busy. I recently discovered that you can add fizz to yo tea here. Say what?! Life changin'...
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Oct 18, 2015~Baristas were friendly and efficient even at 6 in the morning on the weekend. As a barista at another coffee house myself, I know that can be tricky! That friendliness is also something I haven't encountered much in my trips to various other Starbucks. With a great team, anything is possible though. They clearly had great rapport behind bar, and kept busy cleaning and stocking the whole time I was in the store. Thanks for the great service!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Dec 23, 2015~The girls are amazing and friendly, quick and always have a smile!! Two thumbs up to this new establishment!! So happy to have a Starbucks I can use a drive thru ..
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Sep 14, 2018~They closed at minimum 20 minutes early! Very very disappointed. This is my typical spot to stop on Friday night (which is my Monday morning.) absolutely ridiculous.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Mar 14, 2016~Just walked out of this Starbucks and am VERY pissed off. Coffee tastes like CRAP. I asked for extra shots and they just used regular brew. NOT cool.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Apr 21, 2017~Ordered a dark roast on the mobile app... I know a pour over is required at the hour I ordered (after 11am). I walked in and saw the barista pulling out of the pike pot and put it over with the mobile orders. I asked if this was the dark roast and she said yes. I said are you sure because I saw you fill this cup with pike. She said I put a shot of espresso so it's fine. What? I'm not getting what I paid for because you're too lazy to do a pour over? She was wearing a black apron which I thought meant coffee master... she obviously has no focus on coffee. The other one standing next to her was just laughing. Yes, she offered to make me my pour over in the end, but only because i caught her lying to me.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 12, 2016~Have only been here on the weekends - every single time it is a twenty minute wait in the drive through, no acknowledgment of long wait, drinks not ready, poor quality. We've gone multiple times and this has been the experience each time, not going back.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Oct 11, 2016~Let me tell you I come here everyday but today Melissa was in the window that girl has it going on.Thank you Melissa I got in and out!!!!!! Your awesome girl!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~May 5, 2016~Very disappointed with this Starbucks! It took my husband and I five times of going to Starbucks and having them mess up our order for us to finally write a bad review, and it's upsetting to do so because I truly do love Starbucks coffee. So when this one opened we were so excited because of how close it is to our home, but today was our most recent visit to this Starbucks, and yet again they messed up our order. While waiting for our drinks and warmed up blueberry muffin we overheard the woman next to us telling her friend how she had to have them remake her drink because they messed it up the first time. When we finally got our drinks (Mixed Caramel Macchiato) neither of them were mixed, and mine definitely tasted funny, then I tried my husbands, and his was absolutely disgusting. We then waited a few more minutes for them to give us a warm piece of banana bread, NOT the warm blueberry muffin we ordered. We told them the order was incorrect, so they swapped it out for a cold blueberry muffin. Again NOT what I ordered. Our experiences at this particular Starbucks has been very upsetting. We have always been big fans of Starbucks because of the consistency no matter what location your at. This one really let us down. I would be very surprised if we ever go back!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Nov 29, 2017~I had bad experience with this Starbucks location. Most of the time I have been there the drink does not come out right. I ordered cafe mocha with whip cream. They forgot to put the whip cream and the coffee was terrible. I had to throw the drink which I have never done at any starbucks location. Some days the berry hibiscus will be good and other days it would be really flavorless. There are few times when the coffee came out good as well. I am guessing certain people who are preparing the coffee are not up to the standard. I go to this location as it has drive by, else I use the starbucks which is in aqua Fria highway.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Nov 12, 2015~Best triple espresso thus far, even thou they claim all Starbucks are the same, espresso here made by Batista lady Vickie Is a delight.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Apr 2, 2016~Love this place. The service is always top notch and Katie is a great representative of Starbucks. She is very friendly, attentive, and is great at what she does. Joey is great as well. I use the mobile app most of the time and when I arrive the coffee is ready to go and i'm in and out. I would recommend this place to friends and anyone who likes a good cup of coffee or any Starbucks original drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 29, 2016~By far, this is the slowest and most lame Starbucks I have ever visited. The drive thru is ridiculous. I work at Safeway Corp across the street and this store needs to step it up.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Feb 9, 2018~This morning was bad. I did my mobile order from home, a 7 min drive, I get there and waited 15 more min for my drink. I ordered an Iced Vente Coconut Milk `"Mocha`" Macchiato with 4 shots of Blonde. What I got was a Iced Vente Coconut Milk Blonde, no mocha no carmel or if there was I couldn't taste it. I understand you were busy, but I would appreciate it if you would make the drink correctly.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 22, 2017~I love this Starbucks! Dom is a great barista! I come here to do homework everyday and it's such a great environment thanks to all the great baristas. The coffee tastes great every time!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~May 14, 2016~This Starbucks is a joke. I waited In the drive thru for 30mins ON THE WEEKEND with only 5 other cars in front of me. When I got to the window, the young girl opened the window, didn't acknowledge me,didn't take my card, give me my order, instead, she was chatting with the other employees standing like there line isn't wrapping around the building. I'm not one to write reviews, but this Starbucks pissed me off. Definitely left a bad taste in my mouth for Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jan 13, 2016~This is by far my favorite Starbucks in the valley!!! Everyone there is beyond friendly with great customer service!!! (Shout out to Jeremy) They all seem to love their job and they always make my iced green tea latte perfect!! :) I live all the way out in Avondale and this is my go to place to study!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Oct 7, 2016~I travel a lot for work, so I frequent this Starbucks maybe twice a week sometimes. I have become increasing dissatisfied with the service, it seems they can't keep good employees long, there is high turnover and They have made my drinks made wrong several times. I probably wouldn't be posting this review, but tonight topped it off. I pulled in at 8:59pm, the lights were still on, signs and all, and there was one car in front of me. The car in front of me pulled to the window and got his drink, and drove away as I'm sitting still waiting to put my order in. I waited a few minutes, attempted to get somebody's attention through the speaker, but no response(they HAD seen me)Meanwhile, the two baristas inside kept moving around watching me out the window, but saying nothing. As I approached the window, they went around the corner and hid, yet there were two drinks they had left on the counter(presumably theirs). I sat there waiting for them to come tell me something such as`"we are closed`" even though I was there before they closed, but they intentionally ignored me. Once again, more increasingly poor service from this Starbucks. I spend hundreds every year, and through business dealings and other occasions at times thousands in a years time, I'm thinking maybe I need to take my business somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 15, 2024~Oh man, I'm sad to see the ratings so low for this Starbucks. It's my most frequented one *because* I love the staff there.  They are always cheerful, polite, and kind to us and I know that's gotta be hard in the world today. I really appreciate them for it.  There's one barista who knows me by name which is probably an indication that I'm there far too often ;)  But in an impersonal world of chain restaurants, it's such a sweet thing to be recognized.There was a period of a few weeks where our drinks were consistently `"off`" if they had any special changes, but that was several months ago and they seem to have sorted it out.  Now everything is what I expect to get.My kid and I used to come here and work when they were homeschooled and we were always greeted with kindness. It felt like a true `"third place`" not just a faceless chain.My other shout out for this particular location is that the cafe is open until 10pm and drive thru orders until 11:30pm.  Hardly anything is open that late in Phoenix!  This is greatly appreciated after later evening kid activities. Last night our family went in for hot chocolate at 9:30pm after our kids' school play and it was awesome to have a family-friendly place to hang out for a few minutes.Bathrooms and the cafe itself are clean. Straws, etc. are well stocked and easily accessible. This has been a family favorite for 4 years now.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Dec 7, 2024~There is a sign on the door that says the inside Starbucks is not open only the drive-through from 1 PM to 6:15 PM. I was hoping to have some tea and get some work done today.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 13, 2024~There's a reason the ratings are so low for Starbucks now. And there's a reason I go to Dutch bros instead. $6 for a small (8oz), iced caramel macchiato with only ONE shot of espresso. Which tastes like I'm drinking a cup of milk. Whereas going to Dutch bros, you spend $5 for a 16oz (small) cup and the coffee is delicious there. I used to be obsessed with Starbucks, but I'm highly disappointed how they've turned out. Never coming back.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~May 18, 2024~Matthew that was working the drive-through yesterday was so kind and helpful!  Matthew, you really made my day!  Thank you :)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Mar 2, 2024~This location ALWAYS forgets my splenda, and it's really annoying. Any time I go there, they always mess my drink up. It's very rare if I get a drink made the way I ask for them to make it. I'm very disappointed. It's like they make the drink by the quickest and easiest way possible. They seriously need to look at the sticker that's on the cup because 90% of the time, they just use the coffee and milk and skip the rest! It's ridiculous! I'm not asking for that hard of a drink to make either...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Sep 14, 2024~The worker had attitude after I told her i wanted a venti not a grande and told me I didn't specify what size I wanted and I told her as a worker you should ask me what size if i didn't tell you
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 26, 2024~I'm a big fan of Starbucks, and still use my gold card, but I just left there very unimpressed... i ordered a grande hot soy chai and a ham and Swiss croissant and a bacon, sausage, and egg wrap. My drink was made right away, but my food items took an additional 15 minutes to be made - and there was no one waiting for their order besides me in the lobby. The barista apologized and said they forgot to start my order- then gave me my food items burnt and hard. I would have asked for them to remake them, but I was already running late and the barista was more distracted with the conversation she was having with her manager...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Sep 29, 2023~When I place an order, I anticipate a straightforward transaction where I pay and receive my order promptly. However, in this instance, I experienced something different. The woman at the drive-thru window decided to express her opinion, informing me that my disabled child was seated illegally. It's disheartening that she presumed to have knowledge on this matter, especially considering she has no license and certification in SEBB. My child was not placed in the car illegally, and the presence of a handicapped placard should have been a clear indication of a disabled child. I let her know that her opinion was not factually correct and I'll be going someplace else for my drinks from now on. This happened at 10:15am, I'm sure she's very bright and has a warm personality. But she should stick to what she knows and stop spouting off misinformation to customers. Parents with disabled children already get enough negativity from people who don't understand what's going on. We really don't need it first thing in the morning from a drive thru window.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 10, 2024~Zero stars! If you're that mad and bitter in the morning, you should not be working at a coffee place. It seems like the girl that was taking the order was having a nervous breakdown. There were literally three cars in the drive-through lol I went to a different Starbucks, then I usually go to which was a mistake. I've been to this same Starbucks in the afternoon, and a man was rude to me this time it was a woman! I mean everybody here has an attitude. I'll never come to this Starbucks again. They also took my stars and my money! She gave real misery energy like find somewhere else to work if you don't wanna deal with people. I was nothing but nice to her, and she was a witch.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 11, 2023~I ordered a drink for my daughter with decaf. I got a drink that was not decaf and the lady said go around I will remake one for you. I then went around again and she gave me a drink and a broken straw. How could you.. I already left not knowing she broke the straw so my daughter had a drink but straw was not working after her drink was same height as the broken straw.. sham on you lady who was talking on intercom Sham on you!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 21, 2023~I came by after work in the drive-thru for a quick snack before I got home. A sweet, sweet girl named Tara (I hope that's the correct spelling) took my order in the kindest way. She was very pleasant to speak to and so patient. Usually at such a later hour, I expect employees to get a bit cranky (which is totally understandable), but she was bright and motivated to do her job. Food and drink is good as always, but Tara should for sure get a raise for her performance. I wish I could've tipped her more! Definitely returning for the good service.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Feb 26, 2023~I like to drink pour overs. Pour overs are a basic premium coffee product that should be respected for the pleasure they provide. Everytime I go into ANY starbucks to get a pourover, the employees try to talk me out of it. This last time I ordered a pour over, the employee not only tried to talk me out of it but made fun of me to the next customer for ordering one. Starbucks markets itself as a gourmet coffee shop that cares about all things coffee but it doesn't seem like the employees are getting the memo. I am SO ready to support the next coffee business that acts to displace starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 27, 2024~Closing times inaccurate. Internet sucks. With Starbucks being the most expensive Internet cafe with the crappiest services. I encourage everyone to one star them into oblivion.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 17, 2023~This Starbucks is the best in the entire valley!!!!!! My drink is always perfect. Quick and efficient servers/baristas. After so many mishaps at other locations, this is the only location I will go to if I have a choice
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 8, 2023~I've been coming here for awhile the staff is normally so kind and they move really quick .but today some young  gentleman was taking my order at the drive through and he was being so rude and rushing me by saying `"what else `" in the middle of me speaking then when I pulled up we waited for about 5 minutes before we paid or anything so finally we decided to just leave because it was not worth waiting for.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jun 24, 2023~There drinks are pretty consistent but when I ordered a coffee cake that $hit was like 2 days old and crunchy
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 12, 2023~I honestly don't know why this Starbucks has as many bad reviews as it does. Everyone is always so nice! All times of the day, doesn't matter. My drink order is always right at this one too.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 11, 2023~I have had several poor experiences. I only go to this location if I have to. I definitely do not do Uber eats at this location because they don't give me my straws even though I check the box, they're inconsistent making my drink, I caught a girl talking about me (believe me I confronted her) and they close the lobby way early and make mobile orders sit in the long line in the drive through. I pretty much go to the other locations as this one is poorly managed and inconsistent.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Apr 26, 2024~Very poor customer service. Starbucks 98% percent of the time has beyond excellent service. I randomly stopped at this location for the 1st time because it was on my way but  never again personal was beyond rude and lacked in customer service, sure didn't represent the Starbucks at all . Didn't smile, body language was a nightmare, didn't give me a receipt even though I asked for one and still messed up my order and asked me to move forward I refuse to move because I was waiting on my receipt and another barista brought me the receipt make drink and also body language poor and l had to ask for a cup of ice again and for my receipt also. Baristas lead by example and surely this 2 baristas need 1 to leave outside problems outside work environment or just quit because we cust value Starbucks and they all should represent Starbucks embody core value, speed and service! Visit was 4/26 @ 5:42pm
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 25, 2023~This is the third time I've mobile ordered a chocolate chip protein bar through drive thru and they've given me a peanut butter protein bar. It is frustrating being the label clearly says chocolate chip but they seem to rush every time and just grab the first protein bar there... then I have to walk back into the store and grab the right one, what was the point of mobile ordering it.. I've also had drinks made completely wrong from the recipe like the caramel apple spice. They made it with espresso and milk.. a drink that is supposed just be steamed apple juice, syrup, drizzle and some whip... This is the closet starbucks to me but I always seem to leave disappointed by something.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Apr 11, 2023~I order on the app and never have any issues. It's a busy Starbucks. Plan accordingly and do yourself a favor and order ahead on the app. It just helps to ensure that your order will be correct. I come here every Saturday and don't mind the drive thru line. Not the happiest workers, but not rude either. I think they just get overwhelmed at this store. No complaints here.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 22, 2021~Gotta love paying for a $5+ dollars for a tea and taking two sips and it's all gone because they fill it with all ice..... never going to this location again. Makes sense why it was the only empty Starbucks.....
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 21, 2021~So it's been awhile since I've been to this Starbucks. Honestly I go out of my way and avoid this location like the plague. And to add insult to injury the parking is a nightmare due to the construction in the center. Against my better judgment I decided to give them another chance. My bad. I had to go into the Hallmark store to mail a package. I mobile ordered before entering the Hallmark. Paid to ship my package, walk back to my vehicle and drive over to Starbucks. Parked in a red zone because once again the lot is a sh*t $how. Walk in with a nice lady who was getting herself a afternoon treat. She didn't mobile she ordered at the counter. Imagine my surprise after waiting for 10 minutes nice ladies drink is ready, we exchanged niceties  and she is on her way. I inquire about my drink. It's not ready yet! No $h*t. So I watch Abby start to prepare my cold brew with salted caramel cream. Now I don't mean any disrespect but a blind man could have made my drink faster. She worked at a sloth pace. Long story short it took 23 minutes for me to get my coffee. And I'm pretty sure she put white mocha instead of caramel syrup. I order this drink at least 3x's a week. I know how it's supposed to taste. 2 others had mobile ordered and their drinks took just as long to make. What's the point in using the app when it'd be faster to order at the counter. 43rd &amp; T-Bird Starbux I'm done with you.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Sep 22, 2016~First, I have to say that I am a pretty regular Starbucks customer. I have a Gold Card and spend roughly $17 - $20 a week depending on my mood. Second, this is not my normal Starbucks location but I do visit it a couple times a month when I am in the area for errands. It is not my go to location for a couple of reasons.One, even though they have a convenient drive thru it takes a ridiculous amount of time to get your beverage. Even if there is only 2 cars in front of you it takes 15 minutes, on a good day. Two, for some reason my drink is always more. At my normal Starbucks my go to Venti iced coconut milk mocha macchiato is $5.78. At this Starbucks it's $6.25. Three my drink is usually not correct. Last visit I asked for 2 extra pumps of white mocha. After pulling a way I take a drink and almost spit coffee all over my truck. Reading the cup the girl put a +6 instead of just 6 pumps. I believe it normally has 4 pumps. Horribly bitter from all the syrup. Today, I order just a plain iced coconut milk mocha macc and once again I get in my truck and drive away I can tell they did not use coconut milk but regular dairy. I can no longer drink milk. For reasons none of you want to hear! And it didn't have the normal caramel or mocha drizzle.The inside is usually clean, tables wiped, trash picked up, restrooms in order. And they have a nice little patio for nicer weather. But with the repeated mistakes and higher prices and increased wait time I think I will stick to my normal, they how's it going, the usual Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 7, 2023~I come here every morning almost I ask them for lite ice every time and when I get to the window my venti drink is filled with ice. What is so hard about going easy on the ice. The drive thru really need to be a little more attentive
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Dec 5, 2022~I came to this location tonight and ordered a Venti iced Royal English tea latte. First they handed me my drink hot and I asked if they could remake it iced cause I ordered it iced. The girl at the drive through window proceeded to tell me that I could not order this drink iced because it was a hot drink only. I informed her that I always get this drink so I know I am able to order my drink iced. She went to ask one of her coworkers in the back and came back saying that if I wanted my drink iced it would take an extra 5 mins to make it iced....I agreed and waited. She then came back with what looked like an iced water and handed it to me. I am very disappointed knowing that this drink is on one of Starbucks menu items and it wasn't even made right.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Mar 27, 2023~SO disappointed!!! Monday March 27th @ 7:56 am. Ordered a refreshers beverage and I kid you not, only 1 cup of beverage, the REST just PACKED with ice. This is over the top ridiculous as I paid $7 for this drink. The dragon drink was also so watered down that it didn't taste right. On the plus side, the server was lovely and they remembered to add my reusable cup discount.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 12, 2023~On Saturday March 11th @ 7:45am my friend &amp; I walked into this Starbucks.. there were no cars in the drive thru &amp; 1 customer at a table. We approached the counter. And waited and waited and waited... We looked at our watches over five minutes had passed. I asked and we should leave. There were 4 people working 2 at one end 1 making coffee &amp; 1 seeeping the floor . Not one of these girls looked up, acknowledged us, or even said just a moment, I'll be right with you nothing... When we finally did get our coffee, I asked for a grande with a little bit of ice. When I got the drink it was full of ice with a little bit of milk in it, I asked the girl is this a little bit of ice.? She commented`" yes ma'am that's it!! &amp;looked away. We were in a time crunch to go to our meeting. Otherwise there is no way I would've excepted that drink. We paid over five dollars for our drinks and food and this is the service week yet? Absolutely not nobody deserves to be treated this way looked at this way or talk to you this way.!!  my recommendation to everybody is do not do not go to this location. The staff are extremely rude. The drinks are not made correctly! Yelp requires you to hit one star I would hit negative negative negative stars on this establishment!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Apr 9, 2022~World's slowest drive thru... waited in line for 20 min and it's 3:40 in the afternoon
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 2, 2020~Very rude employees ‼ I asked for coconut milk in my drink and she out 2% and when in asked her to change it she got mad and rolled her eyes. Also , The set of where to stand is redicoulous and if your mask slips down a little bit they are rude and ask you to leave if you can't keep it on correctly.. even though they have the plastic sheilds at register and I was standing on the black dot 6 ft away‍.  I truly believe businesses should be providing clean masks at every entrance.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 12, 2023~we waited 5 min to even be acknowledged, was getting ready to leave then they finally took our order and both drink orders were wrong when we got them.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Dec 25, 2019~Great customer service! Came here on Christmas around 9 a.m. Friendly greeting by lady who took our order. Got a sausage breakfast sandwich that had egg and cheese on it with English muffin. To drink got large Americano for hubby and large caramel macchiato for me. Food was hot and good. Coffee of course was delicious. Timed a car going through drive thru. Took 11 minutes from end of line to getting drink at window. About same wait time inside store. Very busy both drive thru and lobby but all workers working diligently and efficiently.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Dec 12, 2022~Poor planning. How can they be out of both cold brew and nitro cold brew in the morning? Those are my 2 go-to low calorie drinks. They said have to wait 2 hrs for them to make it.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 3, 2023~I'm so tired of coming here and the coffee isn't made right and some of the workers are just rude I spend money almost everyday and it definitely isn't worth it. Zero stars if I could tbh
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Nov 1, 2021~This place never has the crunch topping for caramel ribbon crunch. Sometimes they run out of caramel too. Wish management could figure this out. I keep having to drive to other coffee shops around me and this is my closest Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Feb 9, 2018~One of the nicer Starbucks I've been to. It is always so clean and organized and the employees here are always so friendly, however, the drive-through at this location really sucks first thing in the morning. And because of the location of where this Starbucks is located in the shopping center, it makes it hard for the people trying to enter and exit this location as the people at the drive through block the entrance. This last time I came here, I only ordered an iced coffee and it took almost 20 minutes for it to come out due to all the people at the drive-thru. This was a bit disappointing since I was in a rush to get someplace and was hoping to be in and out. They only had 2 people working to make drinks during the rush hour, which I think they would've had a lot more workers to make things run more smoothly. I'll try and remember not to come to this location during rush hours or when I'm in a rush as it can and probably will take a long time just for a simple drink. I'll come back any other time though.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jun 30, 2020~If rude had four daughters these chicks would be it! I accidentally left my mask at home, I tied my sweatshirt around my mouth... my sister and I walked in and you would've thought Beyoncé was trailing behind us the way we got starred at...( super awkward) the barista rudely asked if I had a mask, I said no .. with her bare hands she gave me one, ( ew, germs!  she should've handed me the mask with gloves ‍) the barista asked me to cover my nose, which I declined... as expected per my treatment from waking in the door .. she was rude... meanwhile another barista mask wasn't covering her nose! When my sister was asking question about the coffe she wanted to order... it was as if she was disturbing them.. they would rudely respond back to her with one word answers to her question.... which made her ask more questions.. honestly, it was way too early for all this drama... on the bright side... she got her coffee super fast! Any who, let's do better y'all! Some people might have health conditions to wear covering their mouth is the best they can do without compromising their own health. If someone forgets a mask, be polite about it... graciously hand them one without those judge eyes!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 16, 2020~Had to ask 3 times in drive through for a quad shot vanilla latte. Paid 6.46 for a drink. By the color and taste it was not a quad. Poor service and expensive drink and still got it wrong.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 18, 2020~Drive thru only had 5 cars but took 20 minutes. Slooooooooooooooooooow. Thanks for your patience does not cut it for a company that used to be known for customer service. Second strike...in drive thru with one car ordering. Took so long I parked and went inside. Took forever for barista to self start as she shot the shit without starting my food order. As I'm waiting giving the death stare, the girls don't say excuse me at a crowded bar and one mumbles bitch. Awful service prob due to lack of leaders and teamwork.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Apr 12, 2019~Drive thru only had 5 cars but took 20 minutes. Slooooooooooooooooooow. `"Thanks for your patience`" does not cut it for a company that used to be known for customer service
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Feb 23, 2020~A lot of people come in to do their work here. The staff and manager are amazing, they greet you when you come in. 10/10 recommend. Not other Starbucks I been to makes you feel so comfortable.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 25, 2020~I asked for a warm banana nut bread and this is what I get. Still packaged, and cold! Wtf!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jun 28, 2019~I Stop by this store almost daily because my coffee is always so perfect ! Love love love !!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~May 29, 2019~I love Starbucks, I mean who doesn't. It's not the drinks that is the problem it's the location. Not well kept, tables are sticky &amp; stained, staff are slow &amp; not well trained. Messes up my order, 2 times in a row. 2nd time at this location, not recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jun 24, 2021~The coffee and service is consistently average but this store is always dirty/disorganized. It's pretty standard affair for the trash cans to be over flowing, stock/boxes to be piled up in the lobby, the tables to be dirty, and your shoes to stick to the floor. If it wasn't a convenient location I'd probably go else where.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Oct 3, 2018~Typically wouldn't rate a Starbucks but the amount of locations I have gone to, this one happens to be the best. The employees are the nicest people ever. They always make my drinks right and are pretty fast!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Oct 3, 2018~My favorite location! The baristas are always friendly and take the time to get to know me, my children, and even my dog! My drink is always made to perfection and the drive through is so convenient for this mama of four!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 26, 2021~The guy at the drive thru with purple hair is super condescending and had an attitude. Also tried to correct me on the order I have had for nearly a century. Please correct him or just do not have him interact directly with customers. Thank you.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 31, 2023~So we were told when my fiancé and I ordered that they did not have the cookie crumble for the drinks we wanted. We agreed that was fine and ordered them any way. Pulled up to the window and paid like normal and while waiting for our order I happened to be holding my fiancés hand and leaned over and gave her a couple kisses. Nothing out of pocket or over PDA at all. When the manager brought our drinks to the window we were asked that if we returned to the store to not have display of affection as they have minor employees that are uncomfortable. I returned with a this has to be a joke right and was meet straight faced with a no it's becoming an issues lately and my management has asked me to tell people who are displaying affection to please not. What in the safe space is this country coming to. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location or possibly Starbucks all together. Disclaimer it would only let me post if I have them a star rating but negative stars are not an available option.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Dec 24, 2020~This Starbucks is by far the worst one I've ever been to. I only come here cause it's across the street from home. The drive thru always takes forever. Even when there are only 5 cars but, but 6 employees working. Also, EVERY. SINGLE. TIME we order food, they say they are sold out. I once tried to order 3 food items, and each one was completely sold out. I'm not sure what the odds are of everything being sold out all the time. The girls that work here are very nice, so i feel bad writing this, but i had to be honest. I've been coming to this Starbs for over a year.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 9, 2018~I frequent this location because it is closer to work and home. Even tho the one barista Tarak moved on to another job, I still remain having baristas who know my order and make it right. From Angie, Amy, Jacob, the manager Kristie, the super tall guy with a bandana and this one other small girl her name starts with an L. They are the best!! I love to come when they are working they always have a smile on their faces, are friendly, they know me by name too. They are what keeps me coming they are friendlier than the evening crews. Ohh and on Monday my boss bought drinks and Angie knew the drink was for me. She is such a sweetheart.. made my day.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 28, 2021~Literally go anywhere else.. they're really giving out food that expired TWO MONTHS AGO. the customer service response was a joke- they don't care.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 14, 2022~The other day i went into this Starbucks location and i wanted a simple unsweetened ice tea. Taylor that took my order had complete attitude! super unprofessional and disrespectful, The other barista Abby gave me my order and completely gave me the wrong drink! The tea was so sweet i almost went into cardiac arrest!!! I went back and told them that this wasn't what i asked for and they both laughed at me and called me `"a fat old lady that has memory loss`" and tried to say i messed up my own order and told me if i want a new drink i would have to pay again. So i did, and i pretty sure they SPIT in my drink!!! how disgusting especially during covid? i should sue to be honest. This isn't my first bad experience at this location and i hope theses two girls get fired immediately.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 21, 2021~Paid for a cup of milk when I thought I ordered a flat white. The inconsistency at this Starbucks has really fluctuated over this past year. I don't know how it's acceptable to serve a milk drink when I thought I ordered coffee. Disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Mar 17, 2020~I like how I got a drink the other day with a joke written on it. That's adorable. Keep it up. It definitely brightened my day. Also, Isaac Hyslip is my favorite barista. He's always polite and more than that, he's consistently friendly and positive every time I go there. Keep up the good work ya'll.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 5, 2018~Very slow service you would think only 1 person works here and then you find out they have a whole crew of baristas. I think I waited in drive thru line for 20 minutes.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~May 22, 2017~Just very slow, I understand making the drinks but when I go up to window it's really quick. Too many people want to work here but don't want to work
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Feb 22, 2018~Nice large outdoor patio, good service. Large inside area also. Busy Thunderbird road makes it a bit difficult to hear each other outside but it's hard to be inside during the springtime weather in Arizona. Drinks were made to perfection. Drive through here is always busy so allow some time. Service with a smile, Starbucks drinks and Arizona sunshine, come on, what's not to like?
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Feb 15, 2018~Large patio with comfortable chairs you enjoy a well prepared drink of choice in the Arizona sunshine.  Friendly, hospitable staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 5, 2019~Starbucks is starbucks is starbucks, as far as the menu is concerned. This location though probably has the best vibe of any of the cafes that I have been in. The employees are really nice and they have been quick in all of my experiences. I usually go through the drive thru but it was too busy the last time so I went in. Glad I did.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 9, 2021~This place is infested with flies. You can't sit down without 5-6 flys swarming around you and landing your drinks/food. Not only is it annoying, it's also a health hazard. I don't understand why they don't do anything about it.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 7, 2022~I went yesterday and not only was a charged for a bento when I ordered a grande she also put a tiny bit of caramel when I asked for all over the cup but whatever so I came back today and asked for a caramel iced coffee and I thought I tasted kind of off so I look at the sticker on my cup says vanilla...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 24, 2015~Came through the drive-through to get my regular iced coffee with white mocha and a cool lime refresher. I noticed that there was cones blocking off the drive-thru but continued to the window anyways, where I was informed that there was a nationwide --actually I was informed by the staff that it is worldwide-- system shutdown of some sort.  They were unable to accept payment but the Barista, Maximo, was so kind and gave me a free iced coffee for me and my mom. My poor little mommy has never had their iced coffee, 2% milk with white mocha pumps. She was chugging her coffee faster than me, lol... We both approve.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 15, 2021~Terrible service today just left over charging me I will not be back to this location ever again and they're out of straws for the right size of cups giving us a small straw for a big Venti cup
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 27, 2018~Nasty dirty table.  No wonder we have a flu epidemic in this country!  It's too bad Starbucks has gone so down hill. Filthy seems to be their new norm.  Bummer.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jun 25, 2019~They welcome people when they come in. Very nice staff and quick service. Lots of tables and chairs to sit with 4 lounge chairs and outdoor seating available also. They have a drive thru and plenty of parking next to a mini strip mall- specifically Sally Beauty Supply. It's one of the nicer ones I've been to.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Mar 2, 2019~This Starbucks has really great employees who usually do well handling drive thru orders with speed and diligence, they're also polite and strike up casual conversation while you wait for drinks/food.  The only downside about this location is the drive thru. It wraps around the building and when it gets busy, people cut each other off to get in the drive thru line while blocking the exit. I wish this location would be remodeled to have a better flowing drive thru line!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Aug 26, 2012~I have a love-hate relationship with this Starbux. For a long time it was my absolute favorite place in the valley. To come and read, study, have coffee with a friend ... It is spacious, nice, great atmosphere. Then they started hiring some slow, pretentious morons and it all went down the drain. Lines at the register and drive thru were annoying beyond description. At the same time a lot of people started coming there and on weekends it is almost impossible to find an empty chair. On top of everything they crank up AC that you literally freeze if sit longer than 30 minutes. Well that's the bad. But it is still best place for casual coffee date in the area. It is never dull or boring and atmosphere is always uplifting enough.Update;The new stuck up management can suck it. I'm not pain in the ... about customer service usually, but when newly hired shift supervisor comes to a customer that comes every day (multiple times) for years and says if he leaves tea bag on the floor again (it happened maybe 2-3 times, better than on the tables I would say) she won't serve him again, then I have problem with that. It happened to a friend, I was present and the rudeness and attitude she gave was just disgusting. I'm writing a complaing for this one for sure!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Sep 1, 2021~Love the location. Love the drive thru and how quick it is. Always nice. Starbucks is low key expensive but still so yummy. Very clean and had a really nice sitting area indoor and outdoor. Good to do your work because of the fast and free wifi. Highly recommend this location!! Favorite one by far AND to add on it's the only location that closes at 11pm rather than 8pm like all the other locations. Good for a late night starbies run!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Oct 16, 2014~So I was skeptical to come here after reading some of the recent reviews, but I found the baristas really friendly. She greeted me with enthusiasm and she was in the middle of making my drink (vanilla bean frap) when she came to get the payment and I asked her if it has the same amount of caffeine as mocha frap.She told me vanilla bean frap has no caffeine (whoops). She then told me if I want something to taste like that but with caffeine, I should get the cafe vanilla. She offered to remake my drink even though I said no and didn't want to put her through the trouble. She insisted saying I want you to enjoy your drink so I let her and I actually do enjoy my drink.I like this place- long hours, spacious with plenty tables and comfy leather chairs. They have outdoor seating too :)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Mar 4, 2019~After trying a disappointing new Starbucks location recently, I just have to give this one the excellent rating it deserves. I only knock off one star because the lines can be long &amp; parking is not ideal in this location. But the employees are wonderful, the place is comfortable &amp; welcoming &amp; in all our years coming here the service has always been accurate &amp; fast...never a problem.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Oct 2, 2013~`~*After a girls lunch and shopping, you want a drive thru Starbucks!*`~We drive up and I tell my mom my order literally, 3 times (grande java chip frappachino) and she's still like...a what? So when it's time to order she tries to say it but starts laughing.  We end up laughing really hard.  Finally she composes herself and manages to say `"a granda`". Which makes us laugh more.  The Starbucks girl adds in `"a granda???`" So funny.  Eventually I order my drink and then she gets an equally complicated drink (hot grande skinny toffee nut latte)!This place has down to earth employees and the girl that works when my mom goes in the morning always goes to extra mile!!Our drinks were perfectly crafted and we had no wait at all in the drive thru. I wish this was closer to my home/work but I usually go to the Starbucks on 24th st and camelback or 16th st and Bethany.  Both are decent but the drive thru on 16th can be hit or miss.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jun 19, 2019~Coffee is coffee and tea is tea. But when you have Nick working the drive thru you get the best service, laughs, and some awesome drinks! Thanks for making me and my best friend laugh yesterday Nick! We will be back to see you!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Jun 10, 2016~Typical Starbucks, though maybe a little roomier than most.  Good table for laptop time.  Otherwise same normal not-so-great coffee but good and friendly service.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~May 10, 2019~The store was clean, and they had my stuff ready quickly. The staff was very pleasant. My only complaint was that the restroom smelled like cat litter... Not sure why...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~May 5, 2016~Even when it looks like there is a long line, they are pretty quick! Everyone is always friendly at this location. It's my daily go to location!! The drive thru could have been a little more organized when they originally built it, but hey it's still a great place!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Mar 13, 2019~I have to say that this Starbucks location has been a disappointment. We tried it during a busy afternoon two days ago and they lost our drink orders resulting in a wait of over half an hour. Then this evening we decided to try again. It was supposed to be open until 11pm, but was closed before 9pm.  We won't be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 3, 2018~If I could give them zero stars I would. It's Saturday morning and the level of clientele is moderate (inside), but Aubrey decided to take our order and walk away to make food for the drive-thru customers. Feeling only half satisfied, Aubrey would not let us pay, while a line of 9 disgruntled patrons began to pile up and ask questions. Then the girl making most of the drinks (a saint from heaven, name unknown) was directed to make our drinks (we still haven't paid for). With plenty of time to think about the drinks we just ordered from Aubrey, we decided to make one bigger, so we told the saint from heaven about the well thought out upgrade. With my card in my hand ready to pay, another employee decided to take our order again, and Aubrey intercepts the employee so we could tell her our order again, and the saint from heaven mentions she is already making the drinks. Out of nowhere, Aubrey decided to cough up some unnecessary attitude, to the point where my boyfriend lightly sang to her `"why you gotta be so rude.`" Her Starbucks teammate openly laughs as Aubrey looks sickened by the oh so true lyrics.Also, another time we waited 35 mins on a Wednesday around 2:30 to get our coffee, so I emailed corporate with no response. Please BLACKBALL this terrible MONOPOLISTIC corporation. SUPPORT LOCAL
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Apr 10, 2018~For the most part the employees are nice. This location though runs out of a lot of things. Once I was there at 9am wanting a bagel and they were all out of cream cheese. If you come late afternoon, the majority of the lunch sandwiches are sold you.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 24, 2018~The baristas here is what makes this Starbucks great! They all go out of their way to ensure every customer feels welcome.  Vanessa and miles make the day with their smiles and bubbly personalities.  I love it here
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Apr 11, 2015~A nice modest-sized standalone store, this place could stand to be twice the size given the constant volume of business from early morning well into the night. Staff is consistently, courteous, and though everyone behind the counter always seems to be in a blur of motion  there's always a little wait but nothing extraordinary.  If you really NEED it faster you're probably consuming too much caffeine anyway.  If you want it faster go to Circle K,  pour your own for a fraction of the cost and you're on your way, but if you  or a few ahead of you at SB want one of those hand-mixed custom-made caramel masochist things - expect to wait a little. Overall a satisfactory representation of the Starbucks experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 28, 2015~This is one of those times I wish you could give a zero star rating. I am so done with this location. Practically every time I go they take forever in the drive-through, they are rude, and usually my drink is wrong. Tonight was no exception. Granted it was 25 minutes before they closed however with only one car ahead of me why should I have to wait eight minutes before getting to the window. Then when I get there, they haven't even started my drink (yet somehow miraculously have three other drinks ready to be delivered at the window). And then I realize I just paid $3.19 for a glass that's 80% filled with ice. I think they just invented a new drink `"hint of green tea infused water.`"The straw they gave me broke the camels back. I'm never coming back to this location. You probably shouldn't either.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Aug 20, 2015~I've never had any problems with this location. Most of the bad reviews say that it took forever to get a drink, but I've never had a problem with that. If it's going to take a while, like if they need to do a pour over, they always warn me in advance. I come in here all the time to use their wifi and chill out for a few. I'm giving them 4 stars as opposed to 5 because their tables are always a little dirty and sticky, but this location is always very busy so I am cutting them some slack.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jul 27, 2014~I am a customer who goes to Starbucks EVERYDAY.  I have been doing this since I was 20 - so its been over 20 years.  I moved to Arizona 3 years ago and there are two Starbucks closest to my home, though I travel all over the state and experience various Starbucks.  This particular Starbucks gets the majority of my business.Sadly, the customer service here is horrible.  There is never a time you do not have to wait..either in the drive through or if you go inside.  I am not against a business being busy, thats good news for all of us in business. However, it is terribly frustrating when your standing in an endlessly long line and there are three employees gathered by the door that goes to the back room sipping coffee and talking about when they should take breaks, what they did last night, what happened with the boyfriend and how much they are frustrated with other co-workers and their manager....A customer behind me finally stepped in and said `"do you work here?`" which all three replied `"yes.`".  Then they went on talking.  The customer, who was an elderly lady, went on to say `"are you not suppose to help us? Do you do something else here?`" All three looked at her confused, then looked at each other and laughed out loud.This is my typical experience at this Starbucks.  There is a large amount of customers and a large amount of staff but the staff just don't seem to care about the length of the line and everyone who is waiting.  The customer service that historically Starbucks was known for has gone out the window and they have become the average business providing average service.  Which is unfortunate... I happen to coach people in training sessions and use to use Starbucks as an example - now I just can't do that.Here is the conversation I heard today while typing this... the person making the coffees at the front and the person who is supposed to make the coffee at the drive through stopped to discuss who was the slowest co-worker on the team.  They carried on for about 7 minutes about who they thought was the slowest and why they disliked working with those folks etc etc.  Meanwhile, no drinks were being made.I wish I could say that I won't go to Starbucks again.  My addiction, however, will not allow me to do that.  I am willing to drive the extra miles to a Starbucks that provides great customer service but I cannot give it up all together.I think Starbucks needs to go back to the basics and assure that the name they have made for themselves is saved before its too late.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Apr 6, 2011~Im so glad I can update my review of this place...Let me tell you all the past and what happened this past week.  My girlfriend and I always frequent Starbucks and this is one of the locations that she is a regular at.   Every day, if not twice a day, she comes here and will order a Venti Iced Caramel Macchiato, no ice (because she has sensitive teeth), skinny and mixed well.  What they do with no ice is that they add milk to fill it up.For almost 4 months now, she's never had a problem with that.  But this last week, after getting her coffee she noticed that her usual coffee was no $.75 more.  What??  When asking the girl behind the window to explain, she said that was for the few ounces of milk.  Last I checked, a gallon of milk was about $2.00.  So you're telling me for barely 3/4 of a cup, you are going to charge $.75?  WOW.She asked to speak to the manager, who you could tell loved being the manager of a Starbucks.. Oh the power.  She kindly mentioned that she was a regular customer and this is the first she's been charged for this. He rudely replied `"well we have to charge for milk since you dont want ice.  Do you want your coffee or not?`"  I wont say what i was thinking, but she did.. lol.  She said `"Ill take my damn coffee and never be back here again!`"  Seriously, every other Starbucks we visit and its probably 4 or 5 total,  have never charged to add milk.  In fact, she's such a regular that they usually start making her drink when she walks in.Was it worth it Starbucks on 43rd??  Get a new manager who actually is nice to the customers.  Im done.  NO wonder this place has horrible  reviews.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 6, 2011~Im not judging this on the coffee at all.. this 2 stars goes to how slow this place is. I was once in the drive-thru for 20min..  when we pulled up, they gave us the coffee for free.  Ever since it seems I average 10min per visit.  That's hella long. TIP:  If you are going in the mornings before work. DO NOT use the drive thru...  go inside, it's much faster.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~May 1, 2011~Driving 4 miles out of my way to go to THIS Starbucks. Why? Because THIS Starbucks is Larger, more table tops for homework, and open MUCH later than many of the Starbucks in the surrounding area.I believe this was some sort of old Fast Food restaurant before... you can tell because the bathrooms are totally.... crappy :)AND it is true what is written in some of the other reviews- this place spends a large fortune on the A/C... Brrrr! You can go sit in their outdoor area but there are misters out there and they will turn your pages all wavy. I say, bring a Northface and tough it out!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~May 17, 2012~I'm surprised that this location hasn't gotten better reviews. I go to Starbucks EVERY DAY (ha! sometimes twice!). So I've been to many different locations around the valley. This one, by far, is the best.First of all, I've only had the best experiences as far as customer service. Even when I make outlandish requests, they're always super nice.But the most important reason is that it has a different atmosphere from the other ones. It's open and airy and spacious with lots of light, and good indoor and outdoor seating. I love the 4 person desk they have in the middle - very clean, minimalist, with blue globe hanging lights. This is where I come to do my work. I've tried other Starbucks locations, and it's just not the same - I can't really seem to get into being able to do work for long periods of time. Yet I keep searching for one that's similar.If any of you know of another location like this one, by all means, let me know!Update:  This location no longer has my favorite 4-person desk worksace. Boo!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Apr 6, 2015~How long does it take to get a hit beverage? This place is dead to me. Can't ever get anything right and then when they do it is soooooo slow.This is the most convenient location to me but I'm not going there anymore. Done and done.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 16, 2017~I love this location thunderbird and 19 they no my name as I come in love them love them awesome crew
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~May 16, 2020~Awesome starbucks to go to! Wish they had more tables because it does get busy and can be hard to find a seat. The wait isn't long, especially if you order ahead.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Aug 18, 2017~I love coming here. Staff are genuinely helpful and kind. Wifi is fast. Nice place to chill and do some work with your comp.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~May 3, 2019~this Starbucks is really close to my house and I go here every morning. One thing I found out is to never order in person. The girls never know how to ring up the correct prices or drinks. They over charge you for everything due to them not knowing how to ring up the order correctly. And then they try to kill anyone who's lactose-intolerant because they don't listen to what you order and they try to put actual milk into your drinks. I have to sit there and watch them make the drink just to make sure that they're not going to put the wrong milk in due to the cash register girl bringing up the wrong type of milk. And then when I say something about it I have customers getting mad at me. IMy gut health is not up to you to decide whether or not I should just let it be. so if you do need to order from the Starbucks order through the mobile app so you're getting the correct pricing and the correct drink order. Still double-check it just in case some idiot behind the register decides to mess it up again.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jul 10, 2014~This has been my favorite Starbucks location for a number of years. However, my recent visits have left me feeling frustrated and wondering why I ever liked it so much. This is mainly due to the customer service. This morning I went through the drive thru. My baked item had not been warmed, and the woman in the drive thru never gave my total. She took my card and I don't even think she made eye contact.The lines inside are forever long, no matter what time of day, and I've experienced baristas complaining about their jobs while people at waiting for drinks to be made. Great atmosphere, very poor customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jul 8, 2017~This is my go to Starbucks when in town. It's big, clean, and friendly. It can take a while to get your drink but that's because it is always crazy busy and the lines are forever long. They move quickly and efficiently though, and I've never had to send one back. Mobile order is definitely a god send..
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 31, 2017~Just don't go. Long wait, terrible service, they served the 3 orders in back of me and only when I complained did they start on my 1 chai!! And, the chai tastes watered down! Terrible, terrible!! Go to McD's across the street. Not worth it!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Feb 16, 2019~The baristas are very friendly. I was looking for a Starbucks that was open late. This store is always crowded.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Dec 25, 2012~Love this Starbucks location!  I have been a customer of this location for over 6 years.  I am always greeted with a cheerful barista and my drinks are always correct.This is a very busy location.  Kudos to the employees on cranking out the drinks, even when the lobby is full and cars keep lining up in the drive through.  I appreciate the smiles and pleasantries even when you are under pressure.I have to say that I LOVE the new improvements to this location.  The lobby is much more spacious and modern than before.  So much easier to use my laptop with the new tables, and the chairs are so comfortable.  It's so nice to relax with friends while enjoying the new, upscale renovation.Thank you for brightening my day baristas, especially Alyssa!  You are always a ray of sunshine.  This location is the best!  Keep up the good work and yummy drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Feb 10, 2010~So, I study at coffee shops a lot.  A whole lot.  I've gotten to the point that I feel that I'm getting a little uppity about what I expect in a caffeine shack that I'm going to be sitting, wholly immobile except for my eyes, for hours at a time.  Realistically, I can deal with blah service.  I can deal with less than amazing coffee.  I can even deal with a little bit of a mess.  But there are two things about this starbucks that absolutely drive me nuts.First off, the place constantly looks dirty.  And I mean dirty to the point that I'd prefer to not put my book bag down because I'm worried what it might come into contact with while it's down there.Secondly, the place has either the most powerful AC unit in AZ or it's completely possessed.  There are constant waves of hot, then cold, air that pass through this place.  You have to take your sweater on and then off again in the space of 5 minutes.  A deal breaker?  No.  Annoying as all get out?  Very much so.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Sep 19, 2014~Drive through takes way too long.The staff is rude and unwelcoming.The amount of coffee you get for the price is terrible.There are so many better choices when it comes to coffee! I'm just glad I had a gift card because I wouldn't spend my own money at (this) Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Apr 24, 2014~I usually do the drive thru and they are usually pretty fast even though they are packed crazy busy all the time.  I'd recommend the drive thru and not walking in as when I do go inside I feel I'm waiting longer then when I'm at the drive thru.It's expensive yeah, but what trendy coffee shop isn't over priced.  They all are, get over it.  If you don't like it then buy some Fry's coffee and make it yourself at home and quit your whining about the prices.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jun 19, 2017~There was a big bug in my drink. They offered me no compensation for the time I had to turn around and go inside the store. They gave us replacement drink and wanted me to shut up so it seemed. I also used free drink reward for one of two drinks my husband I got. They did not tell me what new total was and did not even ask if we needed receipt. So we came home with no receipt.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 22, 2017~This is the slowest moving Starbucks I have ever been to! Waiting in the drive through for over 15 minutes with 2 cars in front of me. I can understand a big order but come on people get it together!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Dec 7, 2017~This is my go to Starbucks! I use mobile order and it's always ready when I need it! Their evening team tends to be a bit slower than their morning team but  that's when their peak is so it's as to be expected! Any time they always get my order right though and everyone I've met working there is friendly and happy! The atmosphere is filled with fresh light making it feel spacious and open, they have a great patio too!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Apr 30, 2016~My wife and I were wanting to get a specialty frap but we did not want to stand in line so we chose to order using the mobile app$pay. We sent the order in at approx. 5:10 pm on a Saturday, not the busiest time at Starbucks from what we have already experienced. We intentionally waited for a time when they would be able to process our order in a timely fashion. We gave them an extra ten minutes before arriving to pick them up, hoping to walk in and grab our order without more than a name as we have been able to do at other locations. In fact we chose this location over 19th &amp; T-Bird because we felt like they usually give us better service at 43rd, that was a mistake. After 25 minutes of sitting politely at the waitbar, I finally wandered in front of the coffee bar and had to really be a pest to get eye contact.This is a vastly different experience than what Starbucks would like to be training for. I felt like even after I was looked at, I had to clear my throat, say 'excuse me' or do something to warrant attention from the baristas. I really enjoyed Tarek, who is clearly an off duty employee, held the short female barista's attention daftly for ten minutes while my order sat there unmade, while she made Tarek's two cups of coffee and chatted him up like it was am ice-cream social. I was chuckling as the empty cups with our names on them being passed over to serve customers who were ordering presently. At this point my order was over 30 minutes on the clock and still not delivered. I guess the online ordering thing is just not worth it. I should have stood in the line and waited for Mother Starbucks to decide when I was worthy for my coffee.  Sadly disappointed because the service there has not been this bad before. Probably will pass it on the way to Arrowhead or back down to 19th.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Nov 8, 2019~This is quite literally the slowest Starbucks I've ever been to and the service in general leaves much to be desired. Nothing wrong with the actual product though. My advice: work on getting your drive through moving. It is a terrible idea to have the drive through take 15-20 minutes to get through.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Nov 8, 2017~I picked out my favorite sandwich from the case (price $3.75). I get to the register and order. it rings up for MORE than the advertised price on the printed sign in the display case.I bring this discrepancy to the attention of the cashier and she tells me basically, too bad, the price I will be charged is whatever is in the register system.Then 2 more of her colleagues chime in and basically say the same thing (with no apology, and with a tone attempting to make me feel like I am in the wrong for EXPECTING to be charged the advertised price...)To compensate me for the added charge, you'd think they would:1. Apologize (at the very least)2. Adjust the price to reflect their POSTED price3. Offer a free brew coffee4. Call a manager***NONE of these things happened.***They sent me on my way in disbelief of the atrocious business practice of 1) Charging MORE than their clearly-advertised price and; 2) Having a poorly-trained staff and no process in place for when a something like this happens.These staff members truly had zero interest in whether they were providing an exceptional (or even ACCEPTABLE) customer experience.Shame on your Starbucks at 43rd ave and Thunderbird in Phoenix.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 6, 2017~Darien was awesome! He was so nice and friendly! I will definitely be back at this Starbucks. They were fast and efficient!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~May 19, 2019~Every time I go to this Starbucks they're always super nice and excited to help. It's always enthusiastic when answering the speaker in drive thru and just happy in general. I once spilled my drink when putting it in the cup holder and they replaced it for me even though it was my mistake. By far my favorite Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 25, 2019~The online mobile portion of this store is the worst of I think all the stores almost every single time I have ordered via mobile app I have had to wait for them to make my order. 2 of 5 times if I would have just went thru the drive thru I would have been there and gone before I even would have gotten my online order. Then when you asked where or when your drinks are going to be ready the either get upset or act like they have just been hit by a mass wave of business and the store is not even busy (not customers in line - everyone seated) super disappointed with this Starbucks. Enough benefit of doubts I won't order from this Starbucks again average wait time after online order time an additional 15 mins
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 19, 2019~Really nice place. Food is good very friendly, we come here a lot. Here is a lot of good restaurants and places around this shopping center
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 15, 2017~Sooo slow and disorganized. Ordered two drinks and it took 15 minutes just to get to the window 3 cars ahead and when we got there only one drink was ready. I'd avoid this location
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Sep 28, 2016~Nice place. Always clean. Friendly staff and usually fast considering there's a never-ending stream of cars in the drive-thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jul 7, 2016~Nice place. Always clean (including the bathrooms). Staff is friendly, I think. Some are enthusiastically friendly and glow. Others are friendly, but working too much to give that glow. It's a busy place.There are some cushy chairs in one corner, but I usually opt for the long table. Perfect for working in small groups, with another person, or just chatting with whoever is sitting around. Even the customers seem nice (not that I've met all of them). It's better to park in the big lot than try to get in the few spaces along the driver-thru part of the building. Say 'hello' if you ever see me there! I'm always ready for good conversation with friendly people.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Feb 24, 2017~And again,It doesn't look that great from outside, but it's pretty nice on the inside with multiple choices of where to sit/different type of  chairs. They have big comfy chairs, the long tables, high top tables, outdoor seating, and some seats with counter space by the 'pick up' station. There's basically unlimited extra parking to the west side of the building which is nice because there small lot fills quick when busy as well then it can be a pain to get in and out of. The baristas are friendly and helpful. The wifi hasn't been working for me at this location though. My drinks haven't been staying consistent and it's aggravating especially because I don't want to complain for them to remake it! I've been coming to this locations for a few years, and will continue to go. My drink that is consistently different is a peach green tea, a few extra pumps of peach, and light ice. Which I had today, and was totally different from ever before was almost like it had a splash of lemonade in it. Also had a protein bistro box which I get decently often along with other food items is why I usually go to Starbucks, and it was delicious with 0 complaints the last few times! Why does this location have 3 locations on here?? Well I'll put my review in each!

Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Feb 10, 2017~I like the look of the place, always very clean and friendly. But they are slooooow as molasses. I started ordering via mobile even if I plan on sitting there for a while just because it takes so long. Even then, they don't start making it until you show up. So don't come here if you're in a hurry.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 19, 2016~This place can't make a trenta a simple youth berry ice tea!? Unbelievable....when other Starbucks made them for me without a problem! Ridiculous...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Apr 9, 2016~This used to be my favorite Starbucks but lately I avoid it. I recently went inside to grab a quick iced coffee and it took 25 minutes.  They don't just pour quick coffee drinks like other stores. They put every drink in line for the one person making inside and drive thru drinks. The person working cashier could easily make the basic drinks and their turn around time would be significantly shorter.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Mar 10, 2017~Let me start by saying I am a huge starbucks fan. The location on 41st Ave and thunderbird is atrocious. They are super slow and the drive thru line takes forever!!! I seriously dread coming here, so I go out of my way most days to the location on 27th Ave and peoria. I am currently sitting In the drive thru and have been here 10 minutes now with only about 5 cars ahead of me. The line has not moved. I'm not sure if they are understaffed or they lack better management.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Sep 30, 2016~Great customer service. My coffee is always made the way I like it. Ryan is a very kind and happy barista always ready to take your order. My breakfast sandwich is always available and in stock. The store is clean and tables wiped down. The bathrooms are clean, alwats have toulet paper. The trashes always emptied. Drive thru is fast and never much of a wait. I appreciate this starbucks during my work weeks. Thank you for your service!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 26, 2015~I just went through the drive thru and when I got home both the drinks I got taste disgusting! One is completely watered down and diluted with milk and the other tastes like straight up burnt nastiness. I tried to call to see if they could make me new drinks and after 10 tries with absolutely no answer  (phone just rang and rang) I'm done with this crap so called coffee place. Stuff off Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 17, 2015~This location is right by my house. I find that the employees who work here are seriously the most pleasant Starbucks baristas EVER! And the drive thru line is fast unlike another location that I usually frequent.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jun 14, 2018~This is probably the worst Starbucks ever!  4th car in line and have been for 20 minutes.  Dear owner of this franchise, this is EXTREMELY unacceptable, and we personally will never come back!  It should NEVER take this long.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~May 14, 2016~This is not the quickest Starbucks, but they are very friendly. I like coming in and sitting while enjoying my coffee. The ambiance is nice. The drive thru is good at 5:40 a.m. Any other time, better to walk in and wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~May 13, 2018~While this is my 'home' store, I am constantly annoyed with this location. Nearly every week, I place a mobile order consisting of 4 drinks and 2 croissants. After the allotted prep time, more often than not, I end up waiting another 15 minutes before my order is ready; meanwhile, I've watched all the cars clear the drive-thru. Mobile ordering is certainly not a convenience at this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Sep 3, 2017~my fave starbucks place. the baristas are friendly and nice. it's located near near ASU west campus so it's a bit packed during the weekdays. overall, a nice go to place to chill and hangout with friends.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 25, 2017~Super super slow in the drive thru!!! Took 20 mins with 4 cars in front of me. Ordered a flat white but there was no foam on top. Won't be coming back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Nov 4, 2011~I have to say the Customer Service here is awesome...I love the drive through also...they are always so cheerful and kind
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jun 6, 2008~is today bad customer service day, or is it just me?cashier stood and gabbed FOREVER with some woman while a small line (including myself) just stood there. and waited. uhhh ok. and then after running my sbux card, asked if i wanted a receipt. `"no thanks!`" i said (and i was being nice today, too!). girl wouldn't take no for an answer, not sure why.... and started muttering (seriously!) about my account balance and i might need to refill my card, blah blah... yeah, i dunno. it was awkward and... weird. and really? why would i put more money on a gift card... for me?then barista boy. (yeah, this story isn't over yet) starts chatting with aforementioned `"some woman`" (who really needs to stop talking so people can do their jobs), and THEN bb starts making the drink of the guy who ordered AFTER ME. this is the rare occasion that it would have been faster for me to leave the starbucks, get in my car, and go through the drive thru to order my drink. (we all know how sbux drive thrus are...)and needless to say - the drink was crap. now, i know you coffee connoisseur's will say that sbux coffee is mostly crap. and to some degree - i will admit that sbux is not the best (oh, my poor seattle pride!). but this was exceptionally crappy. will not be visiting this location again. i'd like to take this moment to petition Peet's Coffee to start opening up locations in the valley......
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 14, 2014~Everyone that was there is gone ad it's gone downhill. I feel bad for the customers that have to wait over 20 minutes in drive thru because there are not enough employees there. So sad.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Aug 8, 2012~Best place ever and super awesome people working there. Busiest bux in the valley so might be a wait, but deal with it...it's not fast food. And who stops to get coffee when you're running late? Tip your baristas!!!! No it's not built in. ;)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Sep 9, 2014~It's pretty straight forward. THEY ARE THE SLOWEST STARBUCKS ON THE PLANET!!  Good coffee as always, but it seems like a 20 min ordeal each time to get my iced coffee!!  PLEASE SPEED IT UP.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Dec 30, 2010~Coffee is good , cashier nice but time in drive thru was way too long! 15 plus mins with only 4 cars ahead of me;( cashier comped my drink due to the wait time without me saying a word;)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Dec 23, 2014~Ugh this location is so frustrating. It's the only one on my long commute to work that's easy to get to. It's always busy but not for the right reasons. I can only speak for the drive thru but it seems as though there's only one person running the register and making the drinks. The other 5 employees are standing around. Guess that's why I never see the same person at the window for too long. They must hate being the only one who works and eventually quits. 3 times out of 5 my drink is wrong. For some reason they can't get a regular mocha and a white mocha straight. For me, Starbucks is a treat. I budget for one or two stops each month. So, I look forward to it. Unfortunately I haven't leaned I need to budget more time for it too because I can't usually wait for them to remake my drink. Terrible customer service too.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 21, 2018~Ordered an iced decaf americano with soy. Pulled up, they handed me the drink and I noticed that it didn't say decaf on the label so I asked...they had forgotten. So, the cashier goes and dumps it out and remakes it and brings it over without the soy milk. When I say it was supposed to have soy, she says that she doesn't have any because she used the last of it in the one she just dumped out...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Nov 16, 2014~The absolute slowest starbucks on the planet.  You will spend 20-30 mins most of the time just to get 1 drink.  This location needs a manager who manages.  Staff is also very unfriendly.  They make you feel like you're bothering them.   And half the time if not more, the drink isn't made right.  Too much milk, not enough ice, etc.  switched to 7st and bell and they are fast, friendly and drinks are right.  Went here tonight because I was in area, still slowest on earth, I just don't get why it takes just this location sooooo long.  Other locations can have 10 cars in drive thru and I'm out in 5 mins, this one can't handle more than one customer literally.  Hate this location
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jul 18, 2014~Ranked 3 busiest Starbucks in AZ! Cut them some slack people!! Always busy all day! With some good customer service what else do you want?! Yes the only bad is they take pretty long for a drink when you go inside but drive thru is fast.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 15, 2012~The Starbucks app shows that this location is open until 11pm and that is why I went out of my way to come with a friend here. Only to find out that it actually closed at 10:30 (according to the barista). As we walked up to the counter, the barista rudely barks at me `"What do you want?`" I was in shock. We quickly ordered our beverages and weren't even given an opportunity to order 1 of the 2 pastries out. Even if I had wanted to waste my breath and complain, no one seemed to care about anything else other than cleaning up. Very disappointing service coming from a Starbucks location.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 14, 2014~This is not only the worst Starbucks in the Valley but easily the worst Starbucks I've been to anywhere in the world. Corporate really needs to get some good management into this location. It IS possible to be busy while still providing friendly customer service and accurate orders. This location routinely does neither.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 29, 2016~This team is always on point and very personable.  I commute to work every day,  and this location is my favorite for the drive!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jul 14, 2012~I love this location! Friendly baristas, and I go there everyday (sometimes twice) as well! Yeah, the drive-thru is a little long, but there's usually some gorgeous eye candy guy behind the counter with glasses and a sexy smile, so why not just go in? :)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Jan 5, 2018~This place is always slow at serving.... i dont know if they are short staff or what what but everytime i come through the drive thru and even though theres only 3 cars in line it always takes me a good 20-30 minutes of wait.... wth, speed it ip people!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Mar 25, 2013~I love this place!!!! However, one thing that I am starting to dislike is the hours! They close really early on weekdays, at 10:00pm...come on guys, this is a place that is mostly used for people to do work and to study and closing at 10 is too early...most of us can't study at home because is loud and we rely on places like this to go study and it closes at 10??? IS THERE ANY STARBUCKS AROUND THIS AREA THAT CLOSES AT LEAST AT MIDNIGHT??? Im pretty sure that college students like me understand my schedule and with work and school we have to study at this time.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Mar 9, 2018~It was another pleasant trip through the drive-thru of one of my favorite places! This Thunderbird location is one of the best! They handle the zillions of car orders with prompt and friendly service. Beth was cheery and helpful as she created the masterpiece that is the Hot Chai Latte! Of course, I had to order the Bacon Gouda Breakfast Sandwich to complement my Grande beverage. With its delicious bacon and gouda cheese melted perfectly into the delicious frittata and artisan roll, it is an explosion of flavor of which I will never tire. Consider me a loyal customer, Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Oct 25, 2015~Great coffee and service as usual.  The customers here continue to amaze me with their idiocies!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Oct 3, 2015~Great service as always.  Amazing how ridiculous some customers act.  HELLO! The world doesn't revolve around you!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Sep 27, 2015~Love the coffee and service here.  My only complaint are the customers who think it's a playground for their kids and dogs
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Feb 20, 2015~The drive thru is usually busy. Don't think you'll beat the drive thru by going inside,  they cater to drive thru so you'll still have to wait just as long.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jan 23, 2015~Drive thru. Friendly batistas. Nice place to study or to just sit and enjoy your coffee. Difficult to make a left turn out of the parking lot, but other than that no complaints.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Mar 3, 2013~Love he drive through. If you do go inside the staff is super rad. They are knowledgeable and very fast. This is defiantly a busy store, so everything is always fresh! Great study spot. Free WIFI.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 16, 2018~I have been to many different Starbucks places and this one has yet to be the best one. Many other starbucks water down my drinks.The service is pretty good and fast. The employees are very friendly and hard working. The employees keep the line moving and never sound rude when they take your order.After the employee takes my order they get right to making my drinks. They also don't price as much as other Starbucks do. The amount of time usually spent there is about 20 minutes or so. I also love the fact that they can usually make all the secret menus. They have a great amount of varieties as well.  This Starbucks is a very nice and clean everything is well organized and set up correctly.This location gives a very calm and soothing vibe. It's a great place to come and relax after a bad day or simply just to get some peace. Also it is a very welcoming place and I love being here. I recommend this Starbucks to anyone that's tired of watered down drinks and bad service.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Aug 29, 2013~Happy to report I have since been to this Starbucks (twice) and can say it has been a much better experience in the drive thru and inside. :)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 5, 2012~Let me start with 1 star is too much. THE WORST COFFEE SHOP IN THE WORLD.Subpar drinks. AWFUL customer service. Slow slow SLOW!!I've seen lobsters crawl faster than that place. I will drive 10 miles out of my way and still get my coffee before this place. AND it's dirty. So long..
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 25, 2014~Honestly, the only reason I come to this location is because of how close it is to my house but I think I'll have to be finding a new location. My boyfriend and I waited 3 minutes at the order window after being told it would be just a moment, and then another 15 minutes to get our drinks with one vehicle at the pick up window in front of us. Once we got to the window, I got my tea and we had to wait an additional 3 minutes for our fizzio. No apologies for the wait. Unfortunately, I've found that this has become characteristic of this location. As far as the drinks go, my chai was good as usual, but we would not recommend the fizzio. It's not terrible but it does have a bad aftertaste. One star is because customer service really does make or break the experience, and this location seriously lacks quality service. I still love you though Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 15, 2017~Absolutely 0   Ok, this is the last time I come to this Starbucks! Every time I come here I have to repeat my order the way I want it a million times very poor listening skills the coffee is on the lighter side if you want stronger coffee taste you have to pay extra and when they don't make the coffee as you asked manager won't do a thing to make it right second worst Starbucks ever
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 6, 2014~Stopped off at this location thinking I could walk in and get a real quick drink. Needless to say that didn't happen. I wouldn't have written this review just based on how long it took them to make my tall green tea latte, but I am writing this based on the fact that I had to wait for over 15 minutes for my drink and they served their `"regulars`" before me. I didn't see a VIP line there but apparently at this location they have an imaginary one. They served a gentleman who walked in after I had already placed my order and was waiting for 5 minutes. On top of that there were approx 5 people working at the time and only 1 girl was making the coffee, the rest were laughing and hugging and goofing around. Finally I asked how much longer and apparently they lost my cup with my order on it. If I didn't ask they wouldn't have even noticed that I hadn't received my drink yet. You'd think that because it was their fault they'd offer to comp my drink, but no. I work in the restaurant industry and this right here was just down right poor customer service. Don't know how corporate would feel about this.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 13, 2014~This is a very busy starbucks especially because of the drive thru, I've been going here for years but this is first time I'm leaving a review. Service has always been good and baristas pretty friendly, prompt and knowledgeable. AJ served me the other night and I have to say what a great guy and barista. He was so down to earth and professional at the same time. Kudos to AJ and his great customer service!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 20, 2014~I go to this Starbucks all the time because it is so close to my house and let's face it I'm kinda addicted to their coffee! I usually go on my way to work (around 10am) and sometimes don't leave early enough and the line is particularly long so what do I do? I don't go! Because then that would just be my own fault if I went in and thought it was slow because hello! It's the morning at Starbucks, and this is the busiest one in the valley.That being said I think they do an amazing job! Most people there I encounter are very friendly and have great recommendations!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 16, 2017~Worst Starbucks on the planet.  I will never come here  again.  I will drink coffee from a vend machine before I come back.  I kid not folks get a coffee anywhere else please.  First, I used to come every day my usual is drink venti iced toffee nut latte.  If I go through the drive thru it is a minimum 25 minute wait.  My shots are always expired.  Most of the time they do not have venti straws.  The other day I ordered 6 drinks and was told after the drinks were made they had no cup holders.  I only have 4 cup holders in my car.  The barista offered to put them in a bag.  They spilled of course, out $11.00 for drinks and $50.00 for detailing.  Today, I went inside because the drive thru was so backed up it caused unsafe conditions.  I knew I should have just gone to the Starbucks in Albertsons.  I waited 30 minutes inside to be told that they were out of toffee nut syrup and out of whole milk.  I wanted a refund but the line was so long that I did not have another 30 minutes to wait for my money back.  Get some decent baristas, get some supplies, and get a grip.  I don't usually post bad reviews but this shite takes the cake.  P
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~May 13, 2013~Disorganized! Service slow. Hot drinks were not hot.  This used to be one of the best Starbucks around. What happened?
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Feb 19, 2014~My favorite Starbucks location.  Staff aways polite and friendly.  Clean with lots of space.  It's very convenient and easy to get in and out of parking lot.  Drive through gets me in and out in a hurry.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 31, 2014~We spent literally 30 minutes in the drive thru and the line wasn't even long. To top it off our drinks were wrong! The barista barely apologized for the wait. And didn't apologize ... Not too mention it's not the Starbucks way of doing things. We still had to pay!! Never going to that location again!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Aug 29, 2016~There is an employee named Tarek ( I believe I am spelling that right) that has amazing costumer service. Very friendly and up going.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Aug 22, 2011~Ok people are way to hard on this Starbucks.  First off parking is tight but plenty of places to park if you don't mind walking some people still do this.  Be careful backing out of the spots on bias because people will cruise up to get in the drive thru line. The reason this Starbucks can be slow sometimes is this is the busiest one in Phoenix they compete with the one over at Shea &amp; 101 (I hear they go back and forth so just remember if you go to the busiest starbucks in the state you might wait). I go in here or drive thru here at least 5 times a week.  So ASU west is really close you have your study buddy thing going on, the hospital Banner Thunderbird is just past ASU west so these hospital folks come in.  Then half the people at the gym I go to go in here which is just down the way in the strip mall. The baristas do turn over pretty quickly in here but Bri who works in the morning knows me from my voice when I drive thru at 4 something in the morning on my way to work.  The other older ladies who work in the morning here are always nice.  The afternoons are your highschool/college baristas mostly....definitely some hotties.  There is a beautiful blonde who always wears this punk rock rasta belt gorgeous blonde hair wow she is worth going in here just to dump your coffee out at the door lol. I have gone and waited and also been through really quickly but every one is nice and given how busy they are most of the time I get what I want a strong ass cup of over roasted coffee in a hurry so I can deal with my life. So if you go here please take the aforementioned statements into account.  Also you know why I get in and out of here so fast..? I'm not a pretentious a$$hole I get a venti pike place roast......you coffee hipsters with your `"special orders`" really jam up the jerks who have written all the negative reviews about a really nice Starbucks. Thanks for reading.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 20, 2015~Today, we met the Coffee Master, and he was even wearing an apron that says, `"Coffee Master.`"  He revealed a secret coffee that is not really advertised at Starbucks... so here we go... (drum roll)...  It's the Americano Long Shot??  Shoot!  I think that's what it's called.  It's a coffee drink that will kick your bum!  Anyway, I didn't have it, but it sure is great to know they have it.  Aside from the great interaction with the team here, the customer service is really great!!  I like the layout of this Starbucks because it is spread out, and even when it's busy or crowded at times, you still feel like you're in a large space.  They have this long table in the lobby and I like sitting there cause the chairs are good for the back.  They have a decent size area for outdoor sitting and the ambiance overall is relaxing.  Thank you for the team at this location, you are all so very nice and professional, and I look forward to visiting this location soon.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 28, 2015~This is the only drive thru starbucks in the area so that's why I've given them so many chances. .. but in the last 5 times I've been there, they've gotten my drink right once. Not only that,  when I tell them it's wrong the employees get an attitude. Bought a protein box and right before I opened it I realized there was hair on my apple. Pretty gross!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Apr 28, 2013~5 stars for location! Woohoo! This is close by and convenient because it has a drive thru!  That is about where the stars stop! I have been tolerating the crappy customer service because of the convenient drive thru but today I decided that it just isnt worth it anymore.  The drive thru window opened and closed at least 5 times ...each time I could see my drink sitting there.  It looked sad and I am pretty sure I heard my iced vanilla latte calling out to me on the 4th and 5th try.  Finally a different person came to the window, no hello, no screw you....just a that'll be $4.86 (or whatever it was), I hand her the money, the window slams!  It opens again and finally she hands me my sad drink...no words.....I take my drink....WOW!  Never again!  I will go out of my way to the friendly Starbucks at Bell and 75th even though it is not nearly as convenient!  I am pretty sure `"Starbucks`" would be pissed if they saw you in action.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Aug 25, 2015~Makenize is awesome!!!!!! So friendly, we really enjoyed her customer service. I love the location and size of this Starbucks. It's a very busy location, so it can take a while to get your drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~May 4, 2013~I've never reviewed a Starbucks previously because, to date,I haven't needed to.  They are fairly consistent in delivering quick friendly service.  My experience at this store forced a review.  I walked into a store with two ladies ordering a drink and snack.  The guy at the counter proceeded to chatter relentlessly with them allowing a large line to form while he made small talk completely oblivious to my 10 minute wait and the forming line.  I am typically patient and quickly moved on to placing my order.  He then messed up my order.  I patiently informed him of this.  He tried again, asking my name and then called me by the wrong name with no real concern about getting it right....J-A-M-E-S....sound it out, not too hard.  Got past this to await my order.....wrong size.  Asked the apathetic/indifferent drink maker and she asked if I had a receipt....really?, my receipt?  I kept thinking maybe I'm on that show `"punked`".  Sadly no such luck.  This was an all too real example of how not provide customer service.  It would have made a perfect training video for any company trying to show examples of bad service.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jan 1, 2014~I've been to this Starbucks many times before and I know it switches on and off as being the busiest Starbucks in Arizona, probably because it's right next to ASU West. The staff is always very peppy and friendly. The only downside is that because it is one of the busiest, if you go at a peak time, you may end up waiting twenty minutes for your purchase.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 15, 2014~I want to start off saying that I have never had bad service there. BUT.... the drinks are hit or miss and I usually hit the drive thru in the morning around 5:30 and it is slow. Like if there are 2 cars I will keep going kinda slow. I notice that they take every ones order first then start making drinks WHAT!! `"Ain't nobody got time for that`"
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 8, 2014~I will never go to this location again!  I am not sure if management has changed recently but let me tell you the customer service is horrible! The coffee is horrible! Don't even want to talk about the lines, If a business is that busy maybe they should have more help,or make sure the employees are actually working. I ordered my drink at the drive thru after waiting in a long line only to find they don't have an item to make my drink. This has happened on three occasions, I will go to the one on 43rd. ave. &amp; Cactus where the customer service is awesome and so is the coffee..
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Nov 29, 2014~I've been a loyal Starbucks customer for 8 years - we get 2-4 drinks in the AM and another 2 drinks in the PM so we definitely know our stuff.  This location used to be the best but in the last 8 months it has gone way way downhill!!  The staff morale, the quality of the service, the drinks, and the manager is the worst culprit.  She has lost many of the long term customers (fortunately it is across the street from ASU-West) and the turnover is crazy!!  No sooner do they get your drink perfect and then they're gone and another new person at the mercy of Kelly, the manager!!  I have sworn never to go back to this location but end up going back due to the convenience, but today was the last straw!!!  Rather than try to get the coffee right to the point of paying considerably extra, Kelley will argue with you over which way is the right way, not the way you want it!! If you can avoid this location, do so and maintain your beautiful morning!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 28, 2024~Every morning I stop by around 4:30 AM. They know my voice and they know my order. I truly love it. `"I can't say enough good things about Zack and Michelle at Starbucks! Their exceptional service, warm personalities, and genuine care for customers make every visit a delight. Whether it's Zack's attention to detail or Michelle's friendly smile, they both go out of their way to make sure every order is perfect and that everyone feels welcome. It's clear they take pride in their work, and it shows in the quality of service they provide. Starbucks is lucky to have such dedicated and amazing team members!`"
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 26, 2024~Went thru the drive-thru to get my niece a pink drink for her birthday and a cake pop! The girl was super nice and the drink yummy. Perfect.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 4, 2022~Stopped in after many months. Good news was they finally had the peach herbal tea. Unfortunately only open for pick up, drive through and no public restrooms.  Third Street and Bell Road is a better option.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Mar 5, 2021~Stopped in after a long hiatus, still busy pick up and drive through. Outside seating only. Coffee was hot so no complaints. Nice walk destination.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Nov 17, 2018~Yes....a Starbucks is a Starbucks but have been going here for 7 months. Impressed with the staff and their commitment to customer service and maintaining a quality product. It's a happy place.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 17, 2018~A Starbucks is a Starbucks. Have frequented this one for  several months as a morning walk destination. Place is clean, service is good and the coffee is hot.  They have a couple of low fat breakfast sandwich choices. These are ok...with enough Sriracha hot sauce anything is good. The pay card App gets you instore refills. The drive through is always full but they keep things moving. It's a coffee factory but a successful one
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 27, 2021~After getting a slushee at Quiktrip to cool off, I walked up cave creek road to find a very nice looking Starbucks.This property has a nice shaded patio and indoor seating is allowed.I was very impressed with Baristas Kade and Nick. These guys are professional, cordial and are fast and efficient with my drinks and were happy to add Venti ice waters with my coffees. I rank these two of the best Starbucks staff I've encountered.I got alot of work done and their hours are longer than most in the area.Highly recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 10, 2023~For some reason they close their lobby to people and I work for doordash, so i sat in their half hour line. The lady watched me walk to the door as she was locking it, then said `"yeah you can just wait in the drive thru`". As a doordash employee i'm not supposed to use drive thru's unless it's late and the lobby is closed due to HOURS, not in the middle of the day. I got there at just before 2 sign says `"Lobby closes at 2`", I've just never seen a starbucks do that, not a fan.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 29, 2023~Beware this place steals your credit card info. I haven't been to this location in (12days) and on the 28th from store 48148 (cave creek/bell)  I was charged a payment on my credit card. I've never ever had this happen ever in all my life. I always use my phone to pay. Last time I ordered a physical drink in my history was 20th which is correct. What's even more shocking never used my credit card to pay for my drink ever I my history. I don't think Starbucks has trusted security on their app so, for that nothing is saved in app. Here on out I'll scan my QR code and physical hand something. Unless baristas are stealing info themselves!!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 30, 2023~I ordered at 5:45 exact I was going to use my 50% off coupon they took so long I got to the window by 6:00. The guy was very rude since the start and told me the coupon wasn't available anymore and the guy snatched the money from my hand and closed the window while I was in the middle of telling him I did not want my drink anymore, he still charged me. Came back to me to give me the change and I told him again I did not want my drink anymore and he said `"well there's a trash can around the corner you can throw it away if you don't want it`" and I told him I wanted my money back. He got his supervisor and supervisor gave me my money back.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 5, 2022~If Jacee is at the counter or drive thru ask for someone else. The way she talks to customers is unreal, no customer service.  Worst &amp; most rude Starbucks employee I've ever encountered.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Sep 11, 2021~Besides the fact that they're out of countless items, they're customer service is lacking. You're pretty much screwed if you go inside to order at this location or use drive up. They primarily focus on drive thru customers, if you go inside to order you get to watch 4-5 cars receive their orders before you get yours. I just waited almost 15 minutes for 3 drinks. Oh &amp; they employees work like sloths which definitely doesn't help the situation.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 14, 2023~The drive through took forever and when I finally got to the window I asked about a 50% off deal in the app they were confused which one I was talking about so I tried explaining and she interrupted me and kept trying to explain they don't have it so when I showed her the app she went back and after a few moments came back and said I can do that for you. later my friend who got the drink looked at her app had a different deal taken off instead of the correct deal.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 18, 2022~Horrible customer service, always out of stuff, and just plain rude staff. Stay away for the place
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Sep 5, 2022~** No Inside Seating ** That was an instant turn-off. Drive-thru is open. Be prepared to sit in a line...for longer than you would want or expect from Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jul 25, 2022~This store has succumbed to the neighboring environment and will not allow inside sitting or restroom usage.  Then close the store or support the store needs to allow full service. Not customer service oriented.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Nov 8, 2021~I'm not a fan of this location's choice to have someone standing outside taking orders  with a tablet. The order taker stands 15 feet or more in front of the menu so you have no opportunity to look at the choices, you need to know what you want right away or you have to have a conversation with the order taker about it. I prefer to read menus, see the pictures and have a moment to order, as I don't always know what I want when I pull up. Especially since they change their menu frequently enough that I feel like I have to read the menu to make sure I know what is currently available. At the very least the order taker could stand next to the menu if they are going to keep doing this. Seems like they are copying Dutch Bros.... Not a fan. Might have to choose another location if they keep this up....
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Nov 18, 2021~I've never had an issue at this Starbucks before but today it was ridiculous. We show up and order our drinks (a chestnut praline latte and an iced peppermint mocha - no customizations) at 6:44 with two other people in the lobby who already ordered. We receive the first drink within 5 minutes or so and then we wait about 15 more minutes as they get the other two people out of the lobby but by then there's probably five more people, who ordered after us and still no drink. We see some people leave who ordered after us with their drinks and I go to the counter to make sure they got my drink. I was replied with it'll be out soon and she turned around and walked away. We wait another 15 more minutes before I go up a second time and tell them We've waited a total of 30 minutes for a single drink, and wasn't even replied with an apology from either employee and still had to wait another 5 minutes or so. They hadn't even touched our drink until I went up a second time and when I called to speak with the manager, she said what's the issue and I reexplained and then replied with well it's red cup day and there was a rush, even though I explained that we got there before the rush and was given a brief I'm sorry and that was it. I understand it gets busy but the lack of customer service they had will make sure we don't stop at this one on our morning runs anymore because we were to the point we just wanted a refund for our other drink so we could leave because we were both made late to work because of this.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Mar 22, 2019~Get your life together Starbucks. When someone asks for cream in their coffee, put it in. When someone asks for their croissant to be warmed up, warm it. Your job is not that hard. All you need to do is push buttons. Sincerely, A former Starbucks barista.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 21, 2022~This was the worst Starbucks! There was no seating inside so I bought my sandwich and coffee and sat outside. I went in to throw my trash away and asked where the restroom was and the guy told me there is no public restroom. WTF I am a paying guest. COVID is over it is here to stay move on!  I'll never come back.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 5, 2022~Seems to be a trend for bad customer service at this location. And I've witnessed it countless times. If it wasn't 2 minutes from my place I'd go somewhere else... had to have a drink remade (seems to be a trend too cause I guess making coffee is really hard) so I called ahead; got to the store there's one person in front of us and when it was our turn at the speaker we waited patiently for someone to come on until minutes go by and still nothing.. no `"hi I'll be right with you`" or `"sorry for the hold`" nothing. So I said `"Hello??`" And she finally came on. My partner told her why we were there about the drink needing to be remade and no response at all. So at this point we're getting frustrated so we just pulled up to the window. The window is open. There's really no one inside. One car behind us and nothing. The girl Her name is Jaycee? Was just standing there walking back and forth doing nothing. No one is coming to the window. She's still standing there and finally we said someone my partner asked `"is someone gonna acknowledge that I'm right here?`" And she laughed and said there's other people she's helping... who?? Lmfao and you really can't just say hi we're making your drink now... like the fucking window is open you're right there doing nothing! And the attitude on this girl. She should not be in customer service. So we asked for a manager ... I'm not a Karen but I was not gonna let someone talk to us like that when we spend a lot of money here. So Stacey came to the window we told her everything that happened. I told her I get being busy but at least communicate and acknowledge the person in front of you by simply saying something along the lines of `"sorry for the wait I'll be right with you`" or ANYTHING... so she said she'd talk to her and we asked for the employees name. Stacey tried saying she can't release that information ... I'm not asking for her last name and her address and schedule. I swear I want nothing to do with her I just want her name to report her to corporate cause she does not belong there. And finally Stacey told us her name is Jaycee. Which I have no idea if that's even her name. She looks really tall, kind of bulky. Shoulder length black curly hair dark skin and a RBF until she laughs that a customer is unhappy. Girl at best belongs at a Burger King scrubbing toilets. Doesn't have the attitude of someone who works at a Starbucks that usually has a reputation of good customer service. Called corporate though. They were more helpful and showed they cared and we'll see if something is actually done. Don't like dealing with people? Find a new job. And Stacey? You should probably too. Looks like your name is on here complained about a few times. Maybe we'll just start going to Dutch Bros where the customer service is always good and the drinks are decently priced and taste delicious every time.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 27, 2021~there was spit visible in my drink. just got home. feel sour. however the beverages, a mocha chocolate coffee, with whipped cream, that goood.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 4, 2018~Friendly employee in the drive thru. Order was correct and she was friendly and engaging.  Would stop thru again when in the area. Now if only it wasn't 9 million degrees here haha
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Dec 11, 2018~Great location nice friendly plp, always hot coffeeNice to see same plp they remember what u drink &amp; how u like it made service with a smile
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 24, 2022~This location shut down their bathrooms again. They also shut down their lobby so they could shut down their bathrooms `"by law`". When you ask why they simply repeat `"safety concerns`" and repeat it like a robot no matter what you ask. Do they really think they're all gonna get monkey pox or Covid if they let their paying customers sit inside and use the bathroom but they won't if they shut those down?? Oh boy. And if that's not the `"safety concern`" then what?? We don't know because they don't have enough respect for their customers to be transparent and truthful. Starbucks you really need to stop with the fear it's hurting your business. When did it become ok for businesses to do this stuff?? We are scared today so you can buy our food and drinks and give us your money but you can't use our bathroom cuz we're scared of everything  I just won't go to any locations where they take your money but shut down their facilities. It's not about safety it's about pushing fear and it's not stopping ANYONE from getting the sniffles.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 6, 2020~Incredibly frustrated with this Starbucks. I know times are tough right now, but this store needs to learn customer service etiquette. I was in the drive through line at 5:55 pm, waiting patiently, knowing they closed at 6. 4 cars entered before me and got their order taken. I was the last car in the drive through, it was 5:58 when the barista came on and said they were closed. I told her I've been waiting since before then and I was the absolute last car. She said If we don't close now we'll never close. Thoroughly confused as to how they'd never close when I was the last car and waited just as long as the four that entered before me. Just a tired mama that was trying to get her coffee after getting a break from the baby. Won't be using this location anymore.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 6, 2018~This is by far my least favorite Starbucks I've ever been to. I get a salted caramel frap every time. No special requests, so they should be able to execute it perfectly. I went the first time when they first opened in 2017. It was all ice, almost no flavor and very little liquid. I gave them a few months and tried again thinking they just needed to get into their groove. Same! All ice, no liquid, little flavor. I tried again this morning probably 6 months after my 2nd attempt and SAME. All ice and no flavor!! I know they would say if you don't like it you can ask them to remake it. But as a mom I'm trying to juggle my belongings and a child. I don't critique my drink until I'm in the car and driving away. Also, for a $6 drink they should know how to make, I feel I should be able to trust it's made right. Needless to say, 3 strikes and I will not be returning to this Starbucks again.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 16, 2018~I haven't had any problems with this location. They make my drink stronger than the one down the street. I just got one yesterday and it tasted watered down but this location tasted better. I like the employees and they work really fast. I had been when the drive thru was PACKED and went inside and got my order pretty quickly.They also have the canned refreshers- the other location down the street doesn't have them.Also it's still brand new and looks fancy, good location and cute outdoor seating :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Sep 24, 2017~Took a drink of my ice coffee and almost chocked to death. Not really, but it wasn't fun swallowing this.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Sep 17, 2017~Came here for the first time today, and went through the drive through. The wait was a little longer than the usual. When I got to the window I was handed my drinks and told to have a good day, and had to remind them about my food item. The service was good and my drink was perfect. Just make sure you don't drive off without everything you ordered while the iron the kinks out. This location did just open, and it looks like a nice location to sit inside and enjoy your drink or food inside.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 7, 2018~Ok. Here goes. I'm pretty fussy as my fellow Yelpers are aware and I have read the negatives posted here. Certainly, why would you spend extra $$$ to get bad anything. Right?However... I have to single out the most consistent, competent and ridiculously fabulous barista this side of a fashion runway....LONDON!!! Starbucks please take note here...seriously...this girl (London in case you missed it) is the epitome of great service with a smile. Starbucks should clone her as their corporate profits would exponentially skyrocket! Never an off encounter with her. We get her nearly every time at drive thru and not once have we had a less than perfect experience. She even asks in advance if our Maltese Turbo would like a pup cup. It's like reminiscing about how great service used to be. We have all had those dead eyed drones serve us with zombie like enthusiasm, but we go actually out of our way to visit this store. Today's grande Pink Drink was perfection. Thanks again for inspiring this review!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 21, 2018~Awesome customer service! Clean, quick and friendly! Thank you Starbucks  Would highly recommend stopping by ...... there are Starbucks everywhere, but the employees here are incredible
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Dec 17, 2019~I love this Starbucks! No matter how busy they are, they always manage to keep a smile on their face and keep that shit running! My drink's (almost) always made fast &amp; correctly. Also what happened to Ashley? She was my favorite barista! :(
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 29, 2018~Boy did I get a bad vente espresso frappe, tasted odd and had whip cream that I hadn't asked for.   A few sips and up it came, made a mess of my truck and the dress shirt I was wearing.I didn't go back but the Starbucks at Bell and 3rd St took care of me.  I won't be back at the Bell and Cave Creek store.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 8, 2018~I loved how friendly and fast the service was. I am really happy that they took the time to listen to my order and didn't feel any bit of rush even though they were slammed. This Starbucks store knows how to really operate !
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 19, 2019~Kariah was the sweet girl working the drive thru. Got my drink super fast and offered my dog a little cup with whip cream. Plus her makeup was on point. Would definitely go back and get pointers from her.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 9, 2019~The drive thru is always full and, can't simply can't break a $50 bill... all that wait for nothing. Should handle it better, I know they can change the 50 dollar bills. The worst place!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Oct 1, 2018~Not to busy on a Friday morning when I walked in.  Was able to get service right away.  Was able to get a Cold Foam Cascara Nitro.  Two other Starbucks I go to do not have the nitro machine so that was awesome.  It was delicious and beautiful to look at!  Only downside (minus one star) is that there are no comfortable seating options.  All hard wooden chairs.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Apr 4, 2019~The people are nice! They can't measure to save their life. They just always dump a ton of cream/milk into anything I order to the point I can't taste any coffee. Sometimes I have to have them remake my drink twice in one visit. This trip I mobile ordered it with light cream and they of course managed to dump the whole thing of cream in it.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jun 7, 2019~Really??Now you try to tell me i cant smoke in my car when i am getting coffee on the drive through?You guys are out of your minds and not you but there is no authority in this world that can tell me i can or cant smoke in my own vehicle,and if you don't like it tough beans,i am moving on to better coffee shops there is plenty around here,anyway who wants to pay an overpriced coffee and be told what to do in their own vehicle.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 8, 2018~I have come to this location many times before and my drinks have been ok. Today I ordered a hot soy latte in the drive-thru. It was half empty, full of foam, and the milk was wayyyyy hotter then normal. Seriously need to train the baristas better at this location--they have been drinkable before, but today's drink was awful.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 26, 2017~The worst Starbucks ive been to. Had to repeat our order several times and it was still wrong. When we were told the total, the amount was incorrect and we told them that the price did not sound right. They still R &amp; R card for that amount. Then voided it, then ran it again without telling us what the new amount was and what went wrong. Then she argued with us about why she ran the card without talking to us first. I am very disappointed in the service and we will not be returning. I recommend that you go to one of the many other Starbucks available.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 1, 2019~Bought a cheese danish with lots of black specks on it and wholes in the bread. No napkins
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 13, 2019~I've been coming to this Starbucks for over a year. Everyone is always very nice. Address me by name. Recognize my order when I go thru the drive thru. They also make my order before I'm at the register. Keep up the great customer service. I always like seeing those smiles. Always go out of my way to come to this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 20, 2019~This is the worst Starbucks I've been to they guy that was taking my order was giving me this look when I said what size drink I wanted and he rolled his eyes at me I was just trying to be nice and he was not having it i know maybe he had a bad day but that's no reason for him to make other people feel bad especially when he s working
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 6, 2018~This is my daily Starbucks as its very close to me. The staff is all very friendly and my drink and food are always correct. The drive thru is a busy one, but they keep it moving and always have a friendly barista at the window!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Apr 10, 2019~After reading the reviews on here, I was totally shocked. For one, anyone that says that someone else's job isn't that hard or that all they have to do is push a button is a total moron. Customer service has been proven to be one of the most difficult positions to hold especially in a busy fast-paced restaurant environment. As a former barista I can attest to the fact that one person's opinion of what heavy or light cream is, is totally different from another's. My experience has been that even though this store is often incredibly busy, the employees are always trying to serve you as quickly as possible and to use the measurements and recipes to create consistent beverages. When and if something is wrong or not what I was expecting they're always willing to remake it. I have seen many people treat the employees poorly over something as insignificant as a cup of coffee and yet still they respond politely and do their best to appease that person. I have found Cavecreek and Bell to be full of great employees who genuinely care about their customers and the connections that they create, and isn't that what it's all about?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 26, 2018~This is MY starbucks. I choose it over the others in the area (and there are many) due to the consistent good service. Not to say I've never had problems, but the employees are always quick to fix any I might have without hassle - very friendly and hardworking group. The place is always clean and orderly. Good place to study.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 17, 2018~I've been a Starbucks customer since the first store opened at the Pike Place Market in Seattle. I've been to many stores over the years and in four different states and this was the friendliest, nicest and most helpful store I've even been to. I was there on July 13, 2017, so whoever was working that morning, good job!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 16, 2017~Sunday evening I stopped at the fairly new location at Bell Rd and Cave Creek Rd. I had previously gone once before and had no problems. Sunday was different; besides having issues with my Starbucks gift card the drink was just awful!!!! When I asked how much was on the card they told me they were unable to say until I paid in cash. Which I did and they never came back to the window. If there was a problem with the gift card they should have been more helpful and at least returned it. There was not a line in drive through so there was no need to be rude. When I got home my grandson told me he would drink it as I did not want it, it was awful! He took two sips and agreed with me how nasty it was. Train your staff better, customers are not a joke as they help pay your salary. I would recommend some extra training for these two fellows. I am hesitant to even give one star.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 2, 2017~This Starbucks was a wonderful addition to our neighborhood! The staff is super friendly and efficient, Sam was so nice! The new Nitro Cold Brew on tap is awesome! Super smooth, rich, and gives you that kick start for the day. Richard was great, we will make this location our new home! Loving it!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 24, 2019~I have been to this Starbucks twice in the last week. The customer is paying for a product. The first time, I asked for my drink kids temp, not scalding; both times my drink was scalding when I touched the cup. After I left, I went back to the location, spoke with a Manager and said I was not happy paying $5 for a cup of scalding milk. His response was they are training people. I just came from there again, same thing happened, drink is scalding burned my tongue and it tastes like scalding hot milk with a lot of nutmeg. You really need to get your act together as customers are again paying for a product!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 4, 2017~Rebecca: I walked up to the counter at Star Bucks not knowing what to get for my sore throat. When Rebecca asked for my order, I started off by saying, I'm not sure because I have a sore throat. Before I could continue she said, I have the perfect thing for you. You introduced me to the peach tea concoction and I'm forever grateful. So soothing to my throat. Much obliged, Rebecca!Angel
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 17, 2017~Sandwiches are good and all yes its good. I have to drag this out because this app wont let me just say that its good. They want me to write a book
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 31, 2015~Brittany. Is a Starbucks. Worker she is very friendly and i.   Lovvvvvee her guest service
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 13, 2023~Worse Starbucks ever ordered a americano tasted like dirty dish water. Service was horrible person behind the counter made my order put in the pickup area did with other orders did not even bother to tell me it was there and was very rude
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Nov 16, 2023~Usually I have really good service when I come here. Today the workers seemed annoyed that I was interrupting their conversation with another co-worker. My bakery goods were not ready with my order. That was fine, but I didn't know the snowman cookie was in a basket. The guy was very dismissive about it. It was not busy at all. I left feeling like i was interrupting gossip time. Makes me wonder why I spend money on a overpriced drink so that I can be treated like a nuisance. My days going to Starbucks are numbered. Do customers even matter anymore?
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 15, 2023~took 30 minutes for a drink and a food item. then I'm told they just put it in the wrong spot and its been ready the whole time. poor crew and management would not go again.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 28, 2021~Just wow ! Julia took my order and wasn't friendly from the start. Right at the beginning when placing my order she made me feel uncomfortable, after taking the order she never asked for my name or if I needed my receipt, once my mother and I were waiting for our pink drinks , she got done and just threw our drinks to the side with out saying anything. Unfortunately my mother also noticed her attitude towards us. And yes I had to pretty much guess if that was our drinks , We never got a thank you or a word from her. So if you don't like to deal with customer service it would be great to change your job or just your attitude !
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Dec 28, 2021~This is by far the best Starbucks I've ever been to. The team always greets me with a smile! Julia tends to make my drinks most of the time, and she amazes me every time! No matter if I order something simple or complicated, she does her best! I would leave a 100 star rating if I could :) Thank you Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 24, 2019~I went in this location today. The cashier was not friendly. I was charged for a water which I've never been at any other Starbucks and shouldn't be with the price of their coffee's. When my order was finished and the barista was finished talking to another employee about Christmas plans, I asked for a straw for the iced coffee and she rudely tossed it to me, not saying a word. Rudest Starbucks I've ever been to. They should realize their are plenty of other coffee shops that welcome and appreciate customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~May 16, 2020~Awesome employees, always kind! :) They can be a bit busy at times but the order comes out fairly fast. Wish they didn't charge for water though, it's not expensive just an inconvenience.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Oct 28, 2024~I just went there right before they closed and the costumer service was great! I didn't know what drink I wanted and Anahi helped me decide! She made me as a customer feel cared for! Anahi is a great employee!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Nov 4, 2024~Holy cow this location has dramatically changed! They used to have an Northside and Eastside entrance, which is now only a Northside entrance. There is not longer a seating area inside, but there is outoutdoor seating. It seems like this is just a stop and go location. I had to go inside and order cause my app wasn't working and the drive thru line was going into traffic. I walk in and they asked if I was picking up, then they told me others were having app issues too. I placed an order with a batista for a carmel macchiato but I ended up with the apple macchiato... maybe applecrisp macchiato. Well it was, decent but not something I'll get again.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Nov 22, 2022~Nice location and it was surprisingly not busy. I order through my app for in store pick up. The parking lot is not the greatest, but they do have a drive thru!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Dec 31, 2023~Came here to study for a couple hours. Not too busy. Plenty of tables and outlets.Service was good, quick, consistent as expected for a Starbucks. Mocha frappe was great! They even asked if I want whip cream on top which sometimes they don't ask. That day I felt like it but sometimes I don't and it's kind of a Buzzkill.Good and chill atmosphere for studying. Though, not a lot of sunlight, and the tables are pretty cramped. If there are a lot of people there. Luckily, it was pretty empty the day I was there.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 22, 2023~Wonderful great service I received from this Starbucks. I simply stopped here for a souvenir and they had what I was looking for. The barista was extremely nice and provided great service. Inside, everything seem to be cleaned, stocked and organized. It definitely seem like a great Starbucks. Im a long term Starbucks member and definitely have high expectations when I visit.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jul 17, 2023~Great drinks.  Super fast.  Great online app for preorders.  Alway fresh and clean.  Drive thru is always fast and courteous
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Aug 22, 2023~If you have never tried cold pressed juice, I would suggest buying the Evolution brand that they sell at Starbucks. Admittedly, it's more expensive than buying these drinks on Amazon. I used my gift card to buy a bacon gouda sandwich, two Evo juices, and a vente matcha frapp. Unfortunately, this location does not carry the watermelon Evo juice. They got my order wrong so I had to wait extra for them to re-do my order. The whole order cost $21.50. The food was of average quality.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Apr 15, 2023~Food:Drinks are incredible the team has like a 95% accuracy rate if you add any modifications. They're also one of tastier locations. They have a varying selection of their food products so sometimes a regular favourite may be out of stock for a while. Merchandise: Very limited. They may have the seasonal cups but I rarely see them in store here. They're relatively busy so maybe they run out quickly which is understandable. Ambiance: I've never had a negative experience with any of the baristas. From seeing other interactions they all seem to be very pleasant. Whether drive up or sit down they are very attentive and caring. Unfortunately, if you do choose to sit down to sip, they don't have the cleanest cafe. At any given point their floors are not swept. And there are little flies everywhere.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Dec 11, 2021~Just an average Starbucks experience as far as I can tell...although I'm not sure all Starbucks have coconut milk, which I appreciated here. I was staying with a friend and went over in the morning to get a latte.The following day it was a little earlier and was too crazy crowded to stay, but I don't think that's unusual.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Aug 8, 2023~Great service.. costumer service was great. Thank you for my delicious ice coffee...........
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Nov 21, 2023~Awesome place to meet someone!!! Great coffee and a little expensive but worth it ! Love this place
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 14, 2021~Nasty everytime I go here I want a refund.The best thing you can get is steamed milk and that probably won't be foamed right.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Oct 15, 2019~Star for very friendly cashier/barista.  Star for amazing coffee and snack, as always.But, man-oh-man, no more stars for a miserable drive-through experience!  I get that they're making lattés and such, but it took nearly a half hour to get my order, from the time I started in the line to the time I pulled away.  I'd guess no more than 10 cars total, but everyone drives trucks there, so probably closer to 7.My impression is not based purely on just this one location either.  I've spent plenty of minutes at plenty of Starbucks in my brief time on this planet earth.  Even if I have the cars or exact time in seconds wrong, believe me, this was a much longer wait than usual.Still, the staff were friendly enough, despite the frustrations they likely had to face all afternoon.  The drink and nosh were fine.  Nothing out of sorts there.  Maybe things are faster inside, but I didn't have the chance to find out.  If I'm ever back out there again, though, I might have to give it a go.  If for no other reason than comparison.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Mar 9, 2021~This morning there was a barista gal outside and drive through taking orders which made it fairly quicker during rush hour. Decided to get out and sit for a while. They're pretty good at noticing when homeless people are lurking about begging. It's a beautiful sunny Tuesday and I got plenty of vitamin D sitting outside and a slight sunburn. Good thing I have a cool Grande soy chai latté.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 20, 2021~Titled Waited too Long for Too LittleDROVE IN TODAYWAITED 17 Minutes To get to window pay and come home to have my wife yell me we got charged for a Venti and she got a Grande in the Venti cup.As. Regular Starbucks Customer if not daily this IS NOT acceptable. $6.00 for the largest Hot Coffee they sell to be cheated. The curly hair soft voiced boy at the window better be careful.  Do this to a Karen Or Chad and Starbucks Co. May need Legal onsite.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Nov 21, 2022~While I don't have a good experience here with most of the baristas, Riley is always chatting and trying to build a decent customer connection. Almost always working the POS system and and ensuring customers orders are correct. Riley is a rockstar and absolutely needs to be recognized for it. Thanks Riley!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jun 21, 2019~Dirty bathroom. Disgusting and overflowing trash bins! This place was not even busy and couldn't keep it neat and today.I will not return to this location, especially not to use the filthy toilets.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Oct 22, 2022~Was in the drive through line for 45min. At least 8 cars ahead of me and was late to work. Come on Starbucks. Do better.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Apr 26, 2022~Buyer Beware!!! (Hidden Fees!) Before heading back to Las Vegas we stopped at this Starbucks. This was my wife experience I watched the whole thing.  We came we were greeted happily and friendly. My wife had asked to unlock the bathroom. The 2 women behind the counter chatting up totally ignored my wife. My wife asked again `"Can you open the restroom door please?`" Same Starbucks worker looking annoyed and pointed at the blonde hair lady with glasses said I'm Coming!!! I'm coming..(she look annoyed) (after wife comes out the bathroom)Time to order our Starbucks drinks then head out . The dark hair Starbucks girl takes our order I got pink drink (which includes strawberries inclusions)and my wife got the strawberry refresher (which includes strawberry inclusions). The dark hair Starbucks lady said we don't have strawberry add on  for your drinks (Free) but we can add Dragon Fruit. We say yes to add it . We pay &amp; wait 5-10 mins . Upon grabbing our Drinks we notice no dragon fruit in our drinks and that we had been charged for the added Dragon Fruit inclusions $0.80 cents each drink .Dark hair lady said `"sorry no more dragon fruit`"My wife says `"we'll can you refund it please I mean why pay for something your not going to even have`"...dark hair Starbucks says,`"we don't charge for inclusion in the drink.`" Me: `"But you did.Then told her again we did get charged for it(shows receipt)...`"Do you want a refund then? `" Dark hair Starbucks said looking annoyed. The dark hair girl tells boss what happened and the supervisor says `"Why would I refund something that should be free.`" (I know right!)  She looks at dark hair girl then me&amp; my wife . My wife shows her the receipt and then the supervisor says sarcastically,`"o looks like you did get charge for the dragon fruit. &amp; we never charge for add ons `" moral of the story Check your receipt or you get charged extra things you didn't want to get charged for....
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Oct 20, 2022~If you want friendly service, look no further. Jeserae is the best and greats you with a smile. I usually frequent this spot on weekday mornings and never had any problems . Keep up the great work.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 17, 2021~If I could give it no stars I would. This is the worst Starbucks in all of America and that says a lot. Took them five minutes of me standing at the front to take my order. Then a cool 25 minutes later they gave me my two drinks and cake pops. Just wow it was super impressive. I mean I've never seen anything like it. Stay away from here. Gas station coffee is much better.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 23, 2022~Christina girl at the window &amp; taking orders is really rude &amp; needs to be trained better. She has no manners. We told her iced coffee at the drive thru &amp; gave us hot coffee &amp; told her at the window we asked iced &amp; gave us a really bad attitude.. happened Sep 23rd 10:55am
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Jan 26, 2022~Problems all the time, 2 times I've went here for a chai tea latte. Both times tasted terrible. Had to go to another Starbucks to have them remake it.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 26, 2019~Really disappointed!! I came in at 4pm. It is now 4:41 pm and still waiting for my drinks. One of the managers had to go around and ask us what we ordered. Very disappointed. People that were after us are still getting their drinks before us. I understand if it's busy, but in this case i feel like I've been forgotten about! Definitely will not return to this Starbucks again. Have not even been apologized or even accommodated for the wait. Still waiting.... Update: got our drinks about 4:48... and they messed up on one of my drinks,  wasn't even going to wait any longer. Really disappointed! And to top off look at what I was given, all 3 of my drinks were really sloppy and dripping from the sides, as if they were in a hurry and didn't care.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Nov 22, 2019~Loved the eggnog latte and their house coffee .it was a delight being here .They have so many options both hot and cold brews .you can smell the coffee beans when you enter the store and it makes all that difference :-) welcoming smell aroma of coffeee is so awesome !!Will be back for some more coffeee
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Jan 7, 2020~Really wish they'd take of the bees outside. I've been coming here on and off from my moms since I was 17. Now 27 (about 10 years) and they have wait time down these days and a somewhat good consistency throughout serving the drinks but, it's been 3 times now on my way to work that I've gone to work and had had bees fly into my car I had to shoo one out and literally roll my window up for a minute at the window to not have it in my carLady who served me who says `"cheers`" to everyone gives some mad attitude sometimes too Please don't be rude when I'm paying $6+ for a cup of coffee 3 times a week (usually)I worked in a resort in CO during the winter as a barista as my first job so I know how irritating it CAN be, be your attitude is not necessary Especially when I can afford syrups and build my own bar for $30 or less instead of spending 50+ a month :) Thanks so much
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~May 20, 2018~It pains me to give this location 2 stars. For about a year now I have been frequenting this location four or five times a week in the morning before work. Dylan usually makes my order and knows me by name. The last couple of times he hasn't been there and a 30 something Sour looking woman has been making my beverage and it's been wrong both times. I always mobile order so I know by the label if the mistake is mine or theirs . First time, pineapple black tea lemonade, sweetened. Get to the truck...unsweetened. Ok, I don't need the sugar so I shrug it off. Today, I order a trenta iced caramel coffee with 2%. Pretty simple, pretty straight forward. She puts my coffee up and it doesn't have the milk, black coffee. I show her the label and she says, with attitude, `" my bad`"! Instead of making my drink over she proceeds to dump part of my coffee out and add about 2 tablespoons of milk, puts it back in the mobile order tray and walks away.Starbucks survives on people like me, people that spend at least $5 a day, sometimes twice a day. Not sure if I can frequent this business anymore. The coffee really isn't that good some days it's actually quite bitter and old tasting.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Sep 16, 2017~Only been here a few times, but definitely not my favorite Starbucks. I only come here if I'm in the area.Overall this spot is pretty good. My only real complaint is the people that work here. They aren't very friendly and SUPER slow! I don't know what makes them so slow to get orders out as there are always a lot of people behind the counter. Don't expect the workers to smile or say hi neither. I've never had any problems with them making my drinks correctly, but they constantly mess up on my babe's drinks. How hard is it to make an iced coffee?? I normally go inside as the drive-thru is always so busy! Not the cleanest place! Tables are always dirty and floors need sweeping. Trash is always full to the top and milk is always out, at least when I am there. And bathrooms need checking up on regularly as they need cleaning often. Will probably be back as I need my caffeine, but this location really does need to step up it's game.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jul 2, 2019~My first time here for a `"short`" meeting that expanded to 3 hours. What!  I like people watching stand my companion was great so no big deal. Bathroom was neat and clean, staff was friendly and service was quick. A couple of things:A couple of folks who looked to be transients came in and actually took short naps. Never ordered anything and didn't bother anyone. Phoenix is so hot in the Summer and temps that day were expected to be as high as 112f. I'm glad the employees didn't force the group back into the heat. The other thing is tables and counters were not wiped down when we arrived. I did clean the table myself.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Apr 9, 2022~Please just park and go inside. The drive thru is in the WORST spot imaginable and I was nearly hit because there's too many cars blocking the entrance from the main road. And I was in the parking lot! The city needs to close that entrance off, or the store needs to close and redesign the drive thru so it's safer. This location is not worth going to. Too dangerous
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Dec 28, 2021~This morning Jeserae greeted me with such fun energy even though it was 5:30am. She was so nice and made it seem like she was having a blast! I love coming to this starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jul 6, 2019~Stopped in for a cold drink while waiting for car to be ready at nearby tire company. Not a big store with not too many tables and all were full. We sat at the bar. Drinks came out fast and were delicious as always. We both tried their new cloud macchiato drinks. I got caramel and hubby got cocoa. All workers were polite and friendly and working hard to get orders out. There a wreck 2 groups of homeless people sitting at the 4 seat tables with a couple of shopping carts of their possessions outside. They didn't bother any customers inside and kept to themselves.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~May 27, 2021~Today was difficult,  walked in to only be greeted by this very unhappy girl at the bar, who very sadly said I'll be right with you.  I got a very excited loud `"welcome in`" from the other side of the room though!  The very sad girl finally asked me what my name was for my mobile order, she handed me the order I left.  I realized that my drink was wrong (Which baffles me because it is a Venti iced breve latte how hard is that to make three shots of espresso and half-and-half/breve). So I walk back in and the whole store just seemed like they have horrible management.  The whole store (With the exception of that one person who greeted me with passion) was down and sad and depressed almost!   Not the way anyone should feel when walking into a Starbucks of all places.  I didn't even complain and walked out.  This drink is so easy to make and it's always wrong.  I feel like the baristas have so much going on they can't concentrate on what's going on.  They are rushed and made to be robotic like!  It's sad.  I see it at this Starbucks more then most.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jun 19, 2021~Apparently they don't close at 10:00pm. I pulled into the drive thru behind another vehicle that ordered and when I went to place mine they said I'm sorry but the car in front of you is our last order. Ummm. It's not even 10pm and no one behind me. I came there to get a couple drinks for some people working late in the area that wanted coffee and a smoothie.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jan 20, 2018~This may have been my Worst Starbucks experience. Ordered a Venti coffee and talked with my partner inside of the store for a while then went up to get a refill and that is went my experience went sour. I am a gold member and get free refills and when I went to scan my card I was charged the full price. No big deal, honestly just went back to let her know so I could get my money back. Ann proceeded to argue with me about how I wasn't charged. Though when we looked at my history of payments it showed I was. She acknowledged the payment in my history and said that is how it shows up. No. Never has that ever happened in my history of refills. She wouldn't back down or be reasoned with. I have less money on my card it's obvious I was charged. I'm not one for confrontation so I stopped trying. Thankfully my boyfriend went up to talk to them again because i was too upset. He talked to a different barista who questioned if we were always there in the store at which point he showed them the time of the original purchase and eventually was refunded the money.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 20, 2019~Here's my small of cup of tea  `~ So I went to buy a Grande pink drink, left to Discount Tire and dropped it. I went back to Starbucks, of course not minding to buy another one, they hooked ya girl up with a free Venti Pink drink. I can definitely say this place is a go to place, they're really sweet and very generous. Thank you guys so much, you made my day
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~May 11, 2022~Worst Starbucks!! The drive thru needs to be closed or moved. I drive by here all the time in the morning and literally cars will be lined up on the street just to get into the driveway. And apparently because the sidewalk is city property, they cannot have employees on the sidewalk directing traffic. Well maybe you should have signage or a better system to control the traffic. And if you call to complain, they don't care. And if you get accosted by a crazy person in front of you because you lightly tapped on your horn for the car in front of them to move because cars were backing up into the parking lot, again they don't give a crap. They are lucky I didn't call the police because of the crazy lady who accosted me. Worst Starbucks. And dangerous too.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~May 23, 2020~I have been coming here for 4 years and the personnel here has always treated me great.  If something was wrong they made it right, no questions asked.  They took care of us during COVID and went out of their way to make our day much brighter!! Love the store and its personnel!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Oct 7, 2021~So I usually go through their drive thru every morning before work, and the drink quality is good aside from the mess that is their drive thru. But they handle it well and push out drinks quick. Today I was in a hurry so I went inside and ordered a London fog tea latte. After waiting for ten minutes they handed me an iced tea. No milk. So I asked them to remake it. So the lady threw in some milk and gave it back. So I took a sip and it was super nasty so I asked them to remake it again. So they did. And after five more minutes of waiting they gave me the same a$$ shiet. Bruh how hard is it to steep some tea it was so gross i tossed it in a dumpster as soon as I found one. Went to Starbucks on 43rd and thunderbird and they hooked it upppp
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Feb 5, 2022~Horrible experience. I mobile order at every store so it's easier for me and the baristas. Me and my other waited for 5 minutes after our drinks were supposed to be ready which was okay at first but then they only gave me one drink which I ordered 2, and it didn't have cold foam on it which is more than a dollar extra so I asked for her to put cold foam on it and she dumped the whole thing and restarted it. Fine but she could have just put cold foam on top.. then I asked about my second drink and they didn't even have the sticker. So I showed her my phone and told her directly they weren't the same drinks. She looks and tells me she'll get it going. It takes 10 more minutes for them to remake my two drinks and she ends up making my second one the same exact thing as my first one just a venti, which was completely wrong. I told her it was supposed to be made with mocha and cinnamon dolce syrup and I can tell by looking at it that it was made with white mocha, but she kept insisting it wasn't until finally deciding to listen to me but by that time we had already been waiting in the lobby 25 minutes and I was over it so we ended up just taking and paying for a completely wrong drink because we didn't want to wait another 10 minutes. Extremely disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Aug 18, 2018~What can I say about Starbucks, other than the fact that it's in Phx and hot as hell here!! But went with the new iced coconut coffee latte, so good, wish there was more coconut flavoring to enjoy!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jan 16, 2022~my ham and swiss was frozen inside lol after waiting 30 mins in drive thru lol i was pissed AF like how?
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~May 19, 2016~New location situated a little more west on Peoria.Drive thru never fails to have a line, so keep that in mind if you're planning on not making a pit stop. However, the service and quality of my drink was great. Ordered an iced vanilla latte prior to heading off for 8 A.M. class and expected overly acidic/tangy coffee that Starbucks can sometimes have but found my drink pleasant and not overly sweet with Vanilla syrup. The worker helping me was so friendly and nice! He complimented my car, which never fails to be a conversation starter. She's a MINI, tiny ... but mighty- I always say!Pretty popular location, but staff/service here is great!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jul 9, 2015~New location! I personally enjoy this one a lot more due to it not being wedged between other establishments, unlike the previous location down the street.Went in for an iced latte and a bagel during break and was served quickly. Dropped a star because my drink was a bit on the acidic side and my bagel was kind of tough to chew, despite being warmed up. The location is organized, fast-paced, had everything stocked (food, drinks, napkins, straws) and was so clean. The interior is spaces with bar stools, tables to an open patio.Also for those looking for a quick Starbucks run, they do have a drive-thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 26, 2019~By far the worst Carmel Macciatto we have ever had. As a regular to the 43rd Ave and Dunlap that we couldn't get ti drive through we decided to hit this one.We knew we were on trouble when:1.  the Afro Jock working the mic and the window took 3 tries to confirm our order.2. When he quickly scanned my phone not asking if I wanted to to redeem my free coffees. 3. Then he quickly attempts to hand me our drinks without whip cream and barely had Carmel at all.4. We decided to drive away and sip something the kin of hor Chocolate and Milk. We have be avid Starbucks patrons for too many years for this blatant lack of communication and commitment. And we wonder why there are lawsuits. This young man should walked down the street with a Bell Ringer...For SHAME....SHAMESHAMESHAME
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 26, 2021~I've been here a few times, and typically the food and drinks are really delicious. This time was a little different, it was my fault. I driven through drive-through and realized at the window that we have forgotten our debit card, at the very least, miss placed it. So inconveniently, we had to park our car and looked for the card. while we were looking,a Very nice woman named Tenisse came out and greeted us and still gave us the drinks. I was blown away. Such an awesome and generous thing to do! I definitely recommend this place. As mentioned, I've been here several times before.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 8, 2019~This is a nice place to enjoy a yummy drink while  meeting with people, surfing the net or grabbing something to go. They always get my drinks right and are friendly and professional. We love the drive thru and the restroom is clean.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Aug 27, 2021~This store receives a zero stars. Typically there's 10 people working at this Starbucks location.  No one greets you. When I step up to pick up my mobile order that I put in at least 15 mins prior to my arrival there's an additional wait of 10 mins or more. Not a single acknowledgment from anyone unless prompted. Stores dirty. 10 people making money doing as little as possible. Yet that seems to be the theme these days..
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Feb 26, 2021~Asked for Light Ice and you get a cup of ice. The girl working the counter was not at the counter to begin with and then must have not been paying attention. This one star is for her service. I will not be back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Jun 15, 2018~Was disappointed. It took awhile for our drinks ( was not really busy at all)  and they gave me a blueberry muffin opposed to the scone I ordered. They switched them but it still was not a great experience, and the barista was not in the best of customer service after that.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 22, 2021~I have been to this location numerous times but the past 3 times I've been there, I went inside because the line was really long. Each time I ordered a different latte and every time it was amazing. I noticed it was same the girl who made it the last two times. I can't remember her name but it starts with a `"S`" and she has really long hair. I will make sure to request her to make it again next time I see her there. You should request her to make yours too because they are perfection!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Aug 10, 2019~Dirtiest Starbucks I've ever been in. I mean if I have to wipe tons of crumbs off the table just to make room for my laptop I'm not gonna be very happy here. Even the floor was super dirty with crumbs everywhere. I wasn't happy about using the socket on the floor to plug my laptop I'm. It wasn't clean at all. I get that they're busy but this wasn't a case of a few dirty tables. All the tables were dirty and it was bad... They don't even have to comfy chairs here
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Feb 7, 2016~Always quick when I go thru this drive thru. I saw a lot of reviews saying they were slow, but it's never happened to me, thankfully:)Drinks are always good and they always give my dog a cup of whip:)Love that there is a drive thru now in this area, although this particular drive thru isn't ideally set up for lots of traffic, but again, I've never been here when it was crazy busy so it hasn't really affected me. Overall a great Starbucks:)
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~May 25, 2019~Great customer service here!!! I accidentally spilled my drink and the Manager, Ann replaced it!  All the workers  at this store were friendly!  Most  importantly though they looked happy to be there ! A great testimony to the manager, Ann! Keep inspiring your crew Ann!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~May 4, 2017~This location is notorious for getting my order wrong. I usually let it slide. Today I asked for light ice and the cup was literally full of ice. I will not be returning to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 12, 2020~Not very friendly, not very organized and the hot chocolate was more like chocolate flavored water. My friend had a hazelnut cappuccino with caramel and tossed most of it. Very disappointed
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Feb 20, 2019~When into Starbucks right after an off-duty employee went in with her baby. I waited five minutes as she was engaging in a conversation with a worker at the register. Mind you I'm waiting to order and she had already taken her tea order. The off-duty employee hands her baby over to the employee at the register as I'm waiting another employee had looked at me and nothing. Ended up just walking out. Where's the customer service?
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 10, 2020~I have been going to this location for about 3 years. The staff truly carries out Starbucks Mantra on customer service and quality product. Anne and her team are professional and handle the rush of customers at this high volumn store both inside and the always busy drive-through. You always get a smile and a hello.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 13, 2021~They never have strawberry's just like McDonald's never has ice cream. Please add more to the weekly delivery.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jan 30, 2009~My gawd, have I been so blind?! Every morning I have a shot of espresso at home from my Miele (CVA 4070  Coffee System) with beans from Cafe Cortez. Each shot is velvety smooth with hints of smokiness and chocolate. This is probably one of finest shots of espresso just for me, every morning, except for... Friday.I stay out at my bffs house way out in Surprise once a week to visit her and her bf.  So on my way in to work I sometimes stop by Starbucks for a Friday morning booster. So this morning I ordered a single shot of espresso and nearly choked. Simply horrible, its like a scorched burnt coffee taste that's so bitter while maintaining a weird sourness. My gawd this stuff is pure shit. I cant believe it, after all these years I finally see the light. Starbucks coffee for me is utter crap. I pitched it in the garbage and have sworn off Starbucks. The single star is for the wonderfully cute and perky `"barista`"
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 19, 2020~I went there the other day, and it was not my run in with very hurtful customer service and rude remarks and looks made through the drive threw. Hurts to say this is not the Starbucks you should be going too if you want a welcoming place to come into, nothing but rude things were said to me, and was talked down to while ordering. :( sad.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Mar 2, 2013~Definitely one of the better Starbucks in the area that I have been to.  I enjoy coming to this location a little bit more then the others for a variety of reasons. For starters, plenty of tables! I've been able to find a seat here every single time I've come over the last few weeks and this makes me very happy.  Also, for the most part, it's really clean.  The one time I needed a table wiped down (it was busy and the customer was walking out as I was walking in) it was done quickly by the barista.Staff here is friendly and outgoing, and seem to do a good job of keeping it that way.  Place is well stocked, bathrooms are clean enough, and overall, I really enjoy coming here.  Even though it gets busy at times, its a far better experience then I've had at other Starbucks close to me.Parking's a little tight, so be careful getting in and out, and it's in a strip mall, so there's lots of cars coming in and out.  Even though its an extra mile from my house, its worth coming here.  Free wifi as with all the other starbucks, and they have great hours too!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 5, 2018~Hanna is terrific, while there are a few people who are great there, nice, outgoing and full of smiles.  Hanna always makes my drinks the best.I never knew that restretto even existed until Hanna went out of her way to tell me about it one evening.  I say she went out of her way be a use she was just going out of the door when I arrived and I told her that I was sad that she was leaving because she always makes my coffees the best.  She was touched and said it was her pleasure to make my experience a very good experience.  She never hurried me she told me how to order my drink because I always forget how to order it.  She took her time helping me while she was off duty.  I appreciate her help &amp; genuine smiles.Please reward her for her great customer service.  She really deserves it very much.  Thank you again Hanna.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jun 23, 2015~Love this location! They always are quick in their drive they and my drink is always correct. The entire staff are incredibly friendly, as always!I've been coming here since they moved to this new location and it's so nice. Jazzy-Boo, the barista is my favorite! She is always so bubbly and fun. Great way to cheer up my mornings on my way to work!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 6, 2015~I love this place and the drive-through is especially convenient on my way to work every morning. They have a video order window and are only one of four in the nation!!! So super cool and I took a picture. The staff is incredibly friendly and always so nice I highly recommend the ice coffee as well as the cake pops and vanilla scones. Yummy!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Dec 7, 2018~I went here the other night specifically to get their caramel salted mocha creme frappachino. Once I ordered this item, they told me they had no salt. Why is it still being offered then? That's the whole point of the drink! I ordered the drink anyways, and asked for extra extra caramel. I even asked him to put the caramel around the cup before they put the drink in, and the only extra caramel that I got, was maybe two extra lines on top of my whip cream. None in the cup whatsoever. And then.... we tried to order some of their breakfast sandwiches. And literally every single one that I tried to order, they did not have available. I do not suggest you go to this Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 5, 2019~Every time I go to a Starbucks and request a decaf coffee brewed staff gives me a hard time only pour overs this store finally brewed stated would be 8 minutes I don't mind but it took over 12 minutes.  Attitude at this Starbucks if staff and manger just don't care what happened to Starbucks happy go lucky staff they are GONEI have a caffeine allergy that's why I need Brewed decaf the pour overs SUCK basically water coffee.  Starbucks should do a taste test to see what customers prefer pour over or brewed decaf I will keep giving reviews on this store see if anything changes Highly doubt but we will see
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Dec 27, 2016~The manager made my drink today.  With curdled whole milk.  Said she been using it all morning.   I poured out the sour coffee at work and this is the `"milk`" see pic. They did correct the order, I made sure not to ask for the whole milk again.  but I had to leave work to get it. They should throw out bad milk.  It was chunky.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jan 7, 2020~Went here today at 3:30 pm, the drive thru person was rude and did not listen at all to what we ordered. I told her I was using my stars to get one of the drinks for free but she ended up charging us for both the drinks. She gave me one straw at first but asked if she gave me one or two, I responded with one but she was not listening, before driving off I asked for another straw and she rudely replied, `"that's what I asked you at the beginning`". I have never experienced this at this location until today.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Sep 25, 2016~Nor sure what has happened to this location, but lately it's an absolute mess. Service is slow, but the staff is friendly. This location is not indicative of the cleanliness of Starbucks in general.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Aug 21, 2018~Have had nothing but great drinks from this location. Hot or cold, they make it quick and consistent. I know I'm going to get a great drink. The staff here are very kind and always seem to be smiling (even at 4:30 am).
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 6, 2018~Bad experience both times. Went through the drive thru ordered a Strawberry Açaí blended. They told me they were unable to blend it because `"that's not how the drink comes`". I told her, I get it like this all the time I've never had a problem. She said she would ask her shift supervisor. Then she comes back to the intercom and said we can blend it but we're not allow to put in the strawberry inclusions in the blender. I said `"ok!`" And pulled up to the window. This never happens, what is going on?!It was a free one so I didn't really care anymore.Second time I go in the actual store. I mobile ordered online and they made my ice coffee wrong. They didn't put cream or my extra caramel drizzle in. I go to the register and let the girl know that problem. She didn't say anything. She also didn't remake it either she just put some cream and Caramel on top and called it a day. I was in a rush so took it. Needless to say, that's the last time you'll see me here.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 20, 2019~Starbucks usually has great customer service but not this one. One of the drinks were made wrong and the girl at the window basically told me was wrong. And wanted me to explain in detail what was wrong with the  coffee.  I will definitely go to a different Starbucks even though this one is closest to me.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jun 22, 2018~Broke down on I17 and just made it to mechanic just off interstate...gonna be a big bill and the mechanic drove me to this Starbucks. Accidentally spewed my bad day to the barista and she insisted my coffee was on her today. Who does this anymore? Thank you so much Christina!!! You made my horrible day way better!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jul 21, 2019~After a very long wait at the dive thru,  Starbucks made it right. Thank you Starbucks for my chia tea latte.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 7, 2021~IF YOU WANT TO GET IN A CAR WRECK COME HERE! Honestly whoever was working outside and taking orders Must've had 2 brain cells left, I guess they hire anyone, the traffic is literally out the street, and skipped our order when pulled up further to help the cars behind us. Ridiculous honestly. Do not come here unless you need a new car.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jul 27, 2016~Always super friendly Baristas, the drinks are always as I order.   Always a line on drive thru, dont get in line if in rush, typically faster inside.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Jan 4, 2016~You'd think that when an old, strip mall version of Starbucks moves into its own stand alone building with a drive-thru, everything would be 10 times better.  Unfortunately, this location is the exception to the rule.Slow service - both inside and out. Lackluster 'partners' with personalities to match...this store took a nosedive after moving and apparently left any sort of character and charisma it did have, back in it's dark, empty, Starbucks shell.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Nov 14, 2015~Extremely slow service, crowded spot!  Parking:  Easy, plenty of spots. Service:  Apathetic and uncaring.  The barista / cashier barely spoke above a whisper and when I asked how he was, he stated, `"crap.`" I couldn't hear him anyway but then he expanded to tell me how awful he was today.   The guy was so quiet, I had to keep asking what he said.  Wait time: Forever and ever amen.  My iced coffee seriously took over 25 minutes - wow!  Tons of folks were waiting for their coffees. Food/drinks: Same ole - it's Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Oct 27, 2020~I was charged for pumpkin cream cold foam on top of my iced chai tea latte, but didn't get any cold foam what so ever. Not to mention I received the worst cinnamon dolce latte I've ever had in my life. Starbucks isn't good in general, but it's best avoid this location completely. I can typically choke down a bad coffee that I spent my money on but today ended up pouring my drink down the drain. Disappointing.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 31, 2020~I hate to leave this bad review but this is the second time that I have gone to this Starbucks and they have messed up on my drinks, they all had a odd taste, a little bitter.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 29, 2018~We went through the drive thru and it was organized,  quick and we even went during a special 1/2 off grande specialty drinks!! Our barista was pleasant and everything went with out a hitch! We will be using this drive thru in the future since it is so convenient.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Jun 24, 2018~This location is extremely hit or miss. I come here 2-4 times a week on my way to work and it's not always a pleasant experience. Half of the time I get super rude girls taking my order who have very poor attitudes &amp; interrupt you before you finish telling them your order. The other half of the time I get a really nice guy or older lady who takes my order &amp; tells me to drive safe. I love them! And although most of the staff acts like they hate their job, my drink is 9/10 perfect!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Apr 3, 2015~This Starbucks has really bad ratings for what appears to be a newly opened, or newly remodeled Starbucks with a nice ambiance. Perhaps there were growing pains.I had a non-fat vente Ice Latte and a split a cookie. We were happy with the speed and the new design of this Starbucks. Getting in and out was no issue and the whole process probably took 5-6 minutes. Perhaps Spring Training was a rough time for this Starbucks, but it's definitely a nice looking store with great service.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Oct 24, 2020~I mean it was ok, i ordered a Mango Dragon Fruit Lemonade and they added the smallest amount of it, i can't say they were busy because the line was completely empty. i won't be going here again.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Feb 19, 2018~This location is so close to my house, I love it it's always very quick the barista's are so nice! I enjoy the early morning hours that they're open
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Jul 25, 2019~Every time I've been here, they close earlier than their posted hours on the corporate website. I have a feeling they aren't supposed to, but I'm guessing they rush customers out so they can end their shift sooner.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 24, 2015~Since the Starbucks is moved to the drive thru I don't think any of the same people and it is literally slow as close as I've been in line for a half an hour this middle of the afternoon
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Sep 11, 2020~I go to this location practically every morning. The girl who used to work the drive threw at this time was always amazing. So nice and friendly and easy to talk to at 4am. There is another girl working the drive thru who is rude and moody. If you aren't a morning person, don't work the morning shift because not only do we set the tone for your day, but you set it for ours. (For the record I was very friendly and even tried to have a conversation and got NO response from her except a `"thanks have a good day`". Might have to find a different location to go to so I can start my morning the right way.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~May 17, 2018~The store at 8:54am said they cannot sell me  to macadamia nut cookies because they sold slot this morning. But they refused to state that they were sold out. She just said she can't do that. Being as this is the only 'vegan' friendly item you offer it was mice while it lasted I guess.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 24, 2018~Best location on their side of town. It's always busy but the staff always moves the line quick and they're all always very cheerful and happy to accommodate you. AND this one never runs out of apple juice to substitute in drinks. WiFi always runs good, really nice atmosphere. Whoever's managing this place deserves a gold medal, it's dramatically different than it used to be.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Dec 6, 2015~Giving this location a second chance....writing review as I wait...so still alot of the same slow but they are trying...this time both registers open a plus ...I was here yesterday my drink was wrong, however barista remade with a smile. ..today same barista that remade drink was at register and she remembered me so that's a plus. ...Meg (she had her name tag on) made the drink I ordered Iced Cestnut Praline no whip Extra Topping...and she knows what extra topping is !!!! ;) I'll be back it's closest location
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 30, 2018~Fine, we'll go elsewhere. On 9-29-18 around 8pm, me and several of my friends walked-in to enjoy some drinks and visit. But there was not a free table for all of us to sit together. So I asked the lady outside that was locking up the patio chairs if she would unlock some chairs for us to sit at and was told, `"NOPE.`" So we ended up leaving. I guess the night manager took the night off
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Dec 31, 2019~I always come here but this time was special because there were giving out free drinks from 1-2 and let me say this not matter if the drinks were free the personal there was very nice. They actually enjoyed doing this for us the customers today. Love it thank u Starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Nov 7, 2015~I feel awful giving this location such a low rating, as I've been coming to the old location for years and know most of the old guard by name, but the service has really gone downhill since the move to the drive-thru location. On almost every single visit that falls on a weekday, I wait almost 15 minutes to get to the window, and my drinks still aren't ready. It's even bad on the weekend. Today, there were only three cars in front of me. By the time I got to the window, only one of my drinks was ready. I thought the entire point of the drive-thru system was that the time between ordering and arriving at the window gave the baristas time to make the drinks. The last straw was when my wife and I opened our sandwiches and saw the eggs and sausages practically falling out the bread. Just sloppy all around.I think this has more to do with all the new staff they had to hire because of the addition of the drive thru. I never have issues when the veterans are working.But really, the impetus for the low rating really came when I visited the new location at 52nd St. and Broadway. I was waiting in line less than five minutes, and the barista at the window informed me that my drink was free because I waited too long. Seriously? If the Peoria location had to give out free drinks to every customer who waited more than five minutes on a weekday, they would have to close down.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Aug 24, 2010~Two stars only because the ladies working were fabulous although the one chalked my chai full of ice..... Ummmm easy ice was stated in my order for a reason because I want alot of damn milk!!! The floor was dirty and there were no clean tables.... Maybe the worker bees shouldn't focus on the fashionable friendly faggot(me) because honey.... You ain't gettin none of this!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Oct 20, 2017~1 Star: The price of course was reasonable for the Frappuccino I had ordered.2 Star: Being that I had gone through the drive-thru, I am unable to comment on the appearance of the inside. The landscape was very well kept if anything.-1 Star: The place was is in a rather tight spot across a plaza where there is traffic. I suggest avoiding this location if your in a rush.-1 Star: As for the customer service can be simply be improved by not having an attitude towards customers who need a bit more time to make a selection. The gal who took my order through the drive thru on Oct 16 sounded impatient when I asked for another moment.-1 Star: My overall experience with this location was not at all as I expected. I understand that customers want fast and accurate service but that is no reason for an associate to `"rush`" a paying customer. I will definitely NOT be back to this location in the future.(Thank you for reading this review - I am writing reviews of everywhere I eat when I dine out, places I shop, movies I watch and much more. Stay posted with #ReviewByMariaMescal)
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Apr 15, 2011~Two stars because there isnt a drive thru.. and Im a lazy American who forgot that when you live abroad you walk for coffee and your needs.. Three stars because the peeps working are as friendly as it gets.. but the sugar/condiment bar is dirty.. clean it up Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 2, 2017~Typical 5 am morning coffee run to your local Starbucks but these guys at this location don't really care about your drink order!. I ordered shots of expresso with Carmel drizzle and almond milk. I never got the Carmel drizzle in there and the lady working the drive thru was rude about be charged $3 or something like that for almond milk.  I might as well carry a gallon of almond milk in my car and pour it myself since it's like $2.29 at the grocery store. I usually never get charged for it at different Starbucks locations. This drink that was made tasted like one of the worst I have ever had!. Never be back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jun 3, 2015~Great new location. Definitely an upgrade from previous location and drive-thru makes it 10 times better. Staff is friendly and very helpful and they go out of their way to assure accuracy with your drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Jul 20, 2014~Decent as every other Starbucks. Staff is friendly and go beyond trying to make the perfect drink for you. Place can get crowded so it might take a while. Some tables and chairs in there for people using the free wifi. Overall nice location. It's nice to get out of the car once in a while to get your coffee which has to be done because there's no drive-thru. Location near my house so I frequently stop by.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Sep 6, 2016~I've been going to Starbucks for YEARS! The barista at this location was horrible. Should have got her name blonde hair Caucasian girl-young. She was having a conversation with another coworker while I'm waiting for my drink! Then she doesn't fill up my cup all the way with my coffee (had nothing to do with adding cream). Then she basically slides my drink across the counter like a cowboy movie and turns her back while it's still sliding!!! Rude!! Won't be back! The cashier Caucasian dark hair with tattoos on her hand and was very nice. But unfortunately rudeness overshadows positivity.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Nov 9, 2018~I've been to this location before and usually enjoy my drinks I love the fraps, not this time though. I asked for a cappuccino with a extra shot. I always get this drink with light foam because I dont want a half cup of foam, the person who made my drink Brook, was complaining about my drink right in front of me! She said it was not a cappuccino and started laughing and talking about my drink it made me very uncomfortable and I do not plan to return again. I took my drink to another store and they made me a different one because who knows what that girl did to my drink. Unprofessional and rude, don't talk about customers where they can hear you! I love starbucks as a company though, the holiday cups are so cute and cream brulee is so good!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 29, 2016~Well, this Starbucks has one of the nicest display areas I've ever seen. It looks so clean and organized. The condiments table was clean and stocked. The employees were alive and friendly at 7:30 in the morning. They were all smiling. The employee who rung me up, T-Rex (on his name tag), was patient when my mind blanked at the register. I failed. I know. There were two people in front of me. I had time. I should've known what I wanted. Nonetheless, he was patient and nice. My drink was perfect. Yup. My grande cinnamon dolce frapp. was yummy-licious. Cinnamon dolce is my go-to drink, and it come in a sugar-free version. I tried the new ancho-chili chicken panini. The flavor was good for a quick, heated up sandwich. I don't know why this place only has three stars!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jul 1, 2017~Great store, staff friendly, get my orders right, though I always seem to have something that's not just plain coffee. I will continue to go to this Starbucks whenever I can.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~May 30, 2015~Just opened near my house and the service is awesome! Frappuccinos all day everyday :D
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Aug 22, 2016~Hey thanks Adam for glaring at me when I asked for a cup of ice and I still said `"thank you so much`" after you you said nothing to me and still no response! So over this place being rude!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Feb 13, 2016~I visit here often and everyone is nice just service is slow  I wait in the drive thru 10-15minutes on average. The other day I went with a Co worker and they forgot to make his drink and he didn't get mad but it was a disappointment when they didn't offer a drink on them.  We patiently waited about 10 mins and they weren't busy
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Oct 3, 2019~This location gets my order wrong EVERY SINGLE TIME, and the partners act like it's an inconvenience to remake the drink they messed up.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Dec 14, 2013~I like what they've done with the place. It accommodates the college students and those who come here to study. Kind of busy parking lot and the mornings are a bear to get in here. Good service
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Aug 14, 2016~I was going to do a 3 star review... but the staff are all so great that I bumped it to a four. The salty 3 star would have been because I have watched this location go from dumpy 19th Ave to a much nicer and larger locale near the I-17 and Northern. It almost seems to me like there are now more homeless/transient folks that like to take their months worth of meds in one sitting and hang out in front of the store in 115 degree heat. I realize they are people too and are simply trying to take a break from the heat, but perhaps use some of your pan handling loot for an actual drink and forego your fix in the spirit of staying cool and hydrated. A slumped over body isn't something I love to see when I am walking up to an establishment! Bless the hearts of the crew at this location for their diligence, I wouldn't have the patience.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Oct 21, 2012~Great service. I was In and out in no time. Wish they had a drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Oct 22, 2019~I just started working in this area and let me tell you I will only be coming to this location. Ann and her team make me feel amazing every time I step into their store. They greet me, ask how my Day is , and say goodbye see you next time. Thank you for making My day!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 10, 2019~i've given this place 3 chances and each trip my drinks tasted like absolute garbage. i honestly thought it was just off days for the baristas but like the this is the only location in my area that has disgusting drinks. best to avoid all together. it's really not worth it.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jul 7, 2019~Well this location just lost our business. I would rather drive across town where I get better customer service. My wife orders the same drink daily and just realized if she orders it a different way it saves me money. She has ordered it that way at various stores with no issue but when we went to this store today that was not the case. I ordered her drink and when we got to the window I asked how much and they said  $6.50ish. We told them that wasn't the right price. We were told that we couldn't order it that way. OK first if all yes we can cause she orders it that way EVERY SINGLE DAY. The lady said `"I'll ring it up the way you ordered it but that's not the correct way and you will have to get it the other way from now on`". Also if I had ordered it the way we had in the past it would still be less than what they were charging today. We often overlook the fact that 9 times out 10 we have to have them remake the drink(we continue to go because it is the closest one to our house) but when the customer service is bad and they try to charge more just because they can we are done. Almost every other Starbucks is happy to correct things if they mess up and happy to help you get a deal especially if you are a regular customer but this one is not. They are rude. We will not be returning to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Mar 14, 2013~Okay, I'm not going to hate on the customer service of this Starbucks because it is WAY better than any of the other stores that are nearby.And I'm not going to hate on their drinks, because it's really hard to mess up an iced coffee (it can be done, but you've really got to try to be lazy)I will, however, hate on the last experience I had there: so I get my coffee, sit down to do some studying and a lady spills her drink outside-- no big deal, the barista heads out to clean up the mess and gets the lady another drink. While she's out there, the barista decides to sweep up the floor in the lobby... this is where I start having a bad day.  When she is sweeping, she is doing these long, swift strokes with the broom and kicking up a LOT of dust, random particles from people's shoes, etc. into the air around me... and she keeps doing this, over and over again until the air around me is pretty much filled with nastiness and I have to actually take off my glasses and clean them.BLECHI wouldn't recommend this place for a sit down study sesh, the one on 19th and Northern is better for that, BUT this bux is BY FAR a better deal when it comes to customer service at the counter or at the hand out-- just be sure to leave before they suffocate you with other people's dead skin, dirt and whatever else is hanging out on that lobby floor.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Jun 5, 2017~This is the fastest starbucks ever! They (were) awesome and when i pulled up to the window i was ready to tell them that and tip them. However i met the RUDEST 20 something ethnic boy in the drive thru this morning. No customer service skills, doesnt say a word, scowls at you and pretty much just throws your change and drink at you. This kid should not be in customer service. Im sorry for low rating starbucks it because of this ONE person. He needs to go.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Apr 23, 2017~I just called this location at 4:10 pm on 4/23. This was the conversation. Barista: normal greetingMe: hello. I was wondering if you have the unicorn frappacino in stock? Barista: no. It is sold out across the U.S.Me: oh, okay. Thank you! Barista: *click*Is this normal Starbucks phone etiquette? It was very abrupt and rude. I didn't even get a `"have a nice day`" or even a GOODBYE!! I won't be visiting this location and I am dissapointed in the customer service. I didn't get the employees name but it was a male.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Apr 12, 2016~This review is for Deena. She is the absolute best!!! I was having such a bad morning( left all my money at home on accident) and she made it all better. Thank you so much!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Sep 24, 2016~Great location! Friendly staff willing to help find merchandise not on display, fast service, clean bathrooms, and great outdoor seating. Also helps that they're open late.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Apr 10, 2018~I frequent this Starbucks on my way to work, it's convenient, and my order is super simple.  Literally two words.  That's one word less than `"cup of coffee`".  I'll show up before 6am so I definitely understand how that schedule can grow... tiresome.  But this stop happens to be my very first human interaction of the day and when I'm greeted with `"Hi, what can I get for you...`" and `"That'll be $2.45 at the first window,`" with a blatant avoidance of such simple pleasantries as: `"how are you`", `"please`", `"thank you`", and `"your welcome`", I can't help but wonder if a simple cup of coffee is more than just a warm, caffeinated shot to the chest.  The possibility that the lifeless hand of a corpse handing me an espresso would offer more warmth than this emotionless community college student working the 4am shift at the Peoria Starbucks does cross my mind.  I wonder if she thinks about me somewhere in between the line breaks on page 122 of Walther von der Vogelweide's `"Under the Linden`" during her 7am lunch break.  Is that rogue spark of consideration an echo of shame, triggering the tiniest notion of empathy?  Nay, the resistance of apathy has created a closed circuit.  She simply closes her book, opens her Instagram feed, and double taps an image of her co-worker, Beth.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Apr 2, 2017~Walked into crumbs and straw wrappers all over the tables and floor. After standing in front of one of the baristas for 5 minutes, saying `"excuse me`" about 3 times, to ask her for a napkin so that I could clean the crumbs off the table, she pointed me to the bar with empty napkin holders. Do yourself a favor, stay in your car and just go through the drive-thru. But hey, my drink was good.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 7, 2017~Best Starbucks I've been to. Good customer service and always a smile on their faces. I've never had a problem with them. Never got my order wrong. Of course there's those long lines. But I've waited longer at other Starbucks before.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Aug 21, 2015~Went into this Starbucks on Peoria and bought $50 in gift cards.... And ask for a free drink ( in California they always give me a free drink when I buy this many gift cards) manager Eddie said No!!! I will not be back to this Starbucks!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Jul 17, 2016~If you're in a hurry don't stop here! As many times as I have been here I've always waited between 5-10+ minutes j t he drive thru waiting for my coffee. Yes only a car or two ahead of me which isn't that long of a line to be waiting 10minutes in. I'm not exaggerating either. It's the only Starbucks near me so I deal with it but come on drive thru get with it. Irritated when walk in is faster than drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Nov 5, 2015~This is the SLOWEST starbucks ever and I use to be a barista. I come here at least three times a week and I am always here at least ten minutes and it doesnt matter if I go through the drive thru or go inside. What makes it worse is that they are joking around like they do not have slow service. Stop joking around and make coffee
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Oct 11, 2015~This is my least favorite Starbucks location that I've been to in Phoenix.HORRIBLE Customer Service and they always get our drinks wrong or they taste terrible. We never ever stop here anymore and wouldn't recommend this Starbucks to anyone., especially when there are so many GREAT Starbucks locations.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Oct 9, 2010~They seldom get your order right and before they do, you might have to repeat yourself two to four times. I used to be a fan of Starbucks but this store is a joke.It also takes a while to get your order ready to go on the bar.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Feb 26, 2018~A piece of advice for everyone...DO NOT GO to this branch. Most starbucks employees are usually pleasant, nice, and helpful but not this location. They don't know how to handle good customer service. I ordered a hot green tea latte on my mobile app and got charged immediately.  When I got there to get my drink,  I was presented with an empty cup. I asked some tall, skinny guy behind the counter why it was empty.  He was too busy to even take the time to explain everything. He just told me they're out of the matcha, like `"too bad lady, try again later.`" A little memo would've been nice before I drove to your store and finding an empty cup on the mobile pick up station. I would have understood that they were out of the matcha green tea but coming in with a rude approach from the staff is not acceptable. The guy didn't even help, or at least told me how I can get my refund on my drink. Bad customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 5, 2015~My co workers and I use this Starbucks a lot. We are there at least once a day to fuel our addiction. Every time we go in there they get our order wrong and instead of fixing the drink they just tell us that's what we ordered. Today when we went through the drive through we asked for separate transactions and Eddie said we were not allowed to do that, so we figured we would do multiple payments at the window. They told us we were not allowed to do that either. They got 2 out of 3 drinks wrong and refused to fix them. Mind you one just needed extra Carmel, and the coffee was burnt. This was the worst customer service I've ever seen. Eddie is very disrespectful if you have a complaint. This was the last straw. No one from our store will be using this location. What's even worse is I could spend all day writing about the awful experiences with them, but can't think of a single time they have been polite and gotten my order right.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Nov 19, 2017~Wow. I have never been so wildly uncomfortable and displeased with a Starbucks experience in all my life...Just for clarification, I have been coming to this location for the past 3 years, as I have lived in the area and have never had a bad experience. Granted, it has been a while, and now tonight I didn't recognize any of the staff. Mainly late 20 year old females, maybe older. One gentleman working as well.It was busy and as the place started to fill up I was contemplating moving, as I was 1 person sitting at a table that sat 4. After a couple groups had cycled through and had not sat down, I finally decided to move to the bar stools along the side of the bar. This is where a gentleman that had spent maybe 20 mins at the counter talking had sat. As I would have done with anyone I'm sitting fairly close to, I asked him if it was ok if I joined him, to which he said it was fine. I was literally there maybe 15 seconds, setting up my computer in silence, when a blonde girl quickly sits down in the bar stool in the middle of the bar between us. Apparently I had sat next to her boyfriend, because she took the next 20 minutes (felt more like an eternity) literally all over him. She was kissing him repeatedly and I have never felt so uncomfortable. I wouldn't have minded if they were just talking, I had put in my headphones anyways because I could tell she was there because of me. But as she kept at it, it became clear she was uncomfortable with me sitting there. By the time she finally left, I was so tense that my neck hurt. I kept checking to see if there was any place I could move to. The only option was outside, which I would have done, but I needed a good connection to the WiFi. I felt bad for this guy because you could tell he was uncomfortable as well. Finally, even though I had a lot to do, I packed up and left. I went to the Barnes and Noble down the street, where I will be coming from now on. There is more that involved a couple other female staff members, one of which blatantly disregarded me when I asked for a glass of water while waiting for my drink. When I asked, she ACTUALLY SHOOK HER HEAD NO. It actually might have been the same girl now that I think about it. Either way, I felt blatantly disrespected. I hope this review is taken into consideration by someone with the ability to make changes. I am just curious where the SM was, and God help this store if that was her.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Oct 19, 2018~My pretty blonde hair barista 'Brookes' had outstanding service today. She recommended my boyfriend and I to try the new fall drink Maple Pecan Latte and the drink is phenomenal. I'm a manager at a multimillion  dollar retail business and she's the kind of girl I need on my team. Thank you management team for hiring such a bright talented young women.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 5, 2017~Love this location, it's my go to everyday place. The staff is always so friendly and is always on point with my drink. The drive thru moves fast and the staff is always eager to work.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Jun 11, 2016~I'm highly disappointed in this location. I've only been to this location twice, and both times it has taken longer than 8 minutes to get my drink. Granted there were a few customers in front of me but it wasn't busy. Bad job Starbucks employees.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jan 3, 2016~I wanted to update my review because a few things changed. The rude barista I spoke of last time changed his whole attitude. He is actually really cool now. Maybe it was because he was new, who knows. This location is still really slow but most of the staff are pleasant.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Nov 23, 2015~Don't go to this location if you're in a hurry. They take so long whether you're in the drive thru or walking in. They've hired a new guy and he has the worst attitude in the world. Blonde young dude.. believe me, you'll come across him.. then there's another dude that's been at the new location for a while who's also jerkish.. besides those two, the staff is pretty cool. Like I said, in a hurry, steer clear.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Aug 31, 2015~Bad service and my coffee was half whip cream and I didn't have any bacon on my bacon and cheese Gouda literally one corner has a TINY piece of bacon totally ruined my Monday high. Waste of 9.42 cent.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~May 6, 2015~This recently opened replacement location (just west of former store) presents a far superior experience to its predecessor. Plenty of windows and a high ceiling accentuate the light that is a plus of living in Phoenix. Far more outdoor seating than previous store, as well. Staff was very friendly and efficient. There seems to be a mix of former store staff and new partners. Tiffanie was the barista for cafe customers during my recent visit, and she could not have displayed a more genuinely friendly and professional spirit. I give this four stars based on all my visits to this location, thus far, but wish there was a 4.5 rating.

Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 30, 2018~I can't say enough about how awesome the morning crew is at this Starbucks! I usually come at least 4 times a week and around 6-7:30 and they have the nicest people working.  Hope the manager sees this and lets them know that I greatly appreciate their smiles in the am and always how friendly they are! By the way the manager is super nice too and I apologize that I don't know your name but you and the morning crew is why I keep coming back
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 30, 2017~Absolutely the best Starbucks I've been to since we moved here. O'Hara and Jacqueline are amazing, always super friendly and quick with a smile! I always feel very welcome when I stop in here. My White Chocolate Mocha is always spot on - service is quick and drive thru is always very fast!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jul 2, 2015~This is such a wonderful Starbucks. The staff is very friendly and polite. The dining room is clean as well as the restrooms. The food and drinks here are great. I really like it here.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 15, 2015~I asked for a green tea with light ice sweetened. I got a green tea unsweetened. When they remade it they added extra ice and I got a nice 4 cup of ice.  My uncle ordered a drink and in the time my drink was remade and completely drank his drink still wasn't made. After complaining to the management (Eddie) they still didn't make it. We were waiting 30 mins on one starbucks frapp. He was extremely rude! I've never had this bad of service at a starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Nov 28, 2015~When customers pay $4-5 dollars for coffee, you should train your employees to not be rude or demeaning to customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 10, 2015~I was here visiting this starbucks on Peoria off the 17 freeway this is the location I always stop to get my Favorite beverage a cm I have incountered a cashier Nikolai he makes my day when I see him . I love the staff her but especially Nikolai wonderful young man wanted to give him some wonderful feedback awesome young man!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 3, 2017~I usually like Starbucks but the people who work at this location are rude as can be. Dutch Bros is way better!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 12, 2018~Went thru the drive thru The guy that was helping at first then some one else jumped in so rude to me I'm a gold member and this was the second time coming not happy will not come here again and did not want to take my gold card
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jun 27, 2015~The line here is atrocious for the drive thru. Your best bet is just to park behind and walk in. No ones in there.  So unless you have a kid in your backseat, jump out. The staff is fun and friendly. The new app that I downloaded has helped a lot, even earned a free coffee. Wish it was all built in the app but I had to show my card etc etc. small tech kinks still to work out.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Apr 10, 2016~To start off, this Starbucks isn't the worst one but it isn't the greatest. Some employees are very rude and slow while others are extremely helpful. I only come back because its so close to my job and my co-workers say a guy name Nick brings them back as well. For me, I've had a nice lady help me out who always looks like a `"pin up girl`".
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jul 20, 2015~Alyssa is a rock star with her customer service.  We have never seen her before so she may be a new employee.  From the moment we are helped, with our orders, she smiled, and listened to our requests, and made sure my name is spelled correctly on my coffee cup, not many people ask and when they do, I appreciate it.  More importantly, my coffee was made the way I like it and Starbucks really do stand behind making our coffee or drink the way we like it. This is one of my favorite location and I am happy to return again and again..keep up the great customer service skills and training Starbucks!!  BRAVO!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Nov 27, 2015~Very friendly staff.  Busy but lines moves quickly.  My latte made perfectly!  Would totally recommend when looking for your coffee fix!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Nov 14, 2015~I should have known from the yelp reviews that this Starbucks would be slow, but I didn't think it would take 30 Minutes to get two drinks. I will give them the benefit of the doubt due to the Saturday morning rush, in which the Drive Thru was full and there were twenty plus people inside, BUT it is ridiculous that people that came in after me were served before me. The drive Thru was obviously more important than the people inside. It came to the point were we had to go up there and ask for our drinks, so if you want quick service either cut down 10 Minutes by going through the drive Thru or stand at the counter and Check in on your drink every 5 Minutes or so. On the bright side, my Oprah Chai Latte was good and the baristas were very friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Dec 4, 2011~Definitely need more help in the mornings.  There is one lady who when I see her doing the drinks, I do not get anything that day.  She is slow and always seems like she doesn't know what she is doing.  I only love it when the young girls are working drinks.  Never ever come between 7-8:30 am, expect to wait 30 mins to get out.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Apr 25, 2015~The new location is nice but it is no longer convenient! You now have to drive to the location instead of walking there from the other shops. Seems like a all new staff missing that extra customer service the other location had. All business no personality! Outdoor patio is very large but very uncomfortable with the ridiculous loud drive-thru speaker that completely ruins any relaxation or concentration. Very disappointing!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jul 18, 2015~Great location. Thanks for the drive thru! I enjoy ordering from the app and have my drinks ready upon arrival!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 29, 2015~They didn't even know how to make a simple passion tes. They wait was really long and they were everywhere very unorganized! I go to Starbucks everyday and I get the same drinks everyday and I know exactly how it's made and they tried to argue with me.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jan 5, 2016~I tried to get a replacement drink for one that they made that tasted like soap or chemicals. I wasn't able to get back to that location for 2 weeks due to work and travel. When I tried to get my replacement drink the store manager Tiffany, I believe, was extremely rude and treated me like I was lying and a thief trying to get a free drink. How many people call complaining of soap/chemical taste. She took my complaint over the phone. 2 weeks isn't long enough to forget a complaint that specific. I had to call Starbucks corporate to have my drink replaced. They agreed she should have just replaced the drink and apologized for her. Her fake smile rockabilly sweet looks are no good if you're hideous on the inside. Just saying.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Nov 25, 2013~Everything they do they do with a smile. Fun and friendly baristas. Knowledgeable and informative when asked about a tumbler cup they had on sale. I'm looking for a trenta size refillable cup and they informed me I can actually use their cup they give and I'll get the discount. Thank you Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Nov 13, 2014~This location usually has a low wait time and the drinks are made well. There is a very friendly male barista who works super early; unfortunately, I don't know his name - but he's awesome!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 10, 2017~Haley was so rude and extra snobby. Her hair looked like she hadn't looked in the mirror before work !!! I'm so disgusted by this employee I will definitely not be going to this location any more. !! Dear management try to pick em a little better
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Aug 31, 2015~Thank you Deena (hope spelling is right)!  No one could ask for better Customer Service than what Deena showed me. I had forgotten my credit card at home didn't realize it until I pulled up to the window.  I told Deena to please cancel my order that I had forgotten my card.  She said well we aren't going to let you leave without your coffee for the day.  I have never experienced such kindness at any store/restaurant ever.  Little did she know I had car trouble the night before and had to get it fixed before my week started and I was running on 3 hours of sleep. So I really did need my coffee. Thank you so much for your kindness.  To some a cup of coffee is not a grand gesture but it was Deena's kindness that was.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Aug 25, 2015~I cannot imagine a more poorly laid out location. This is worse than when they were in the strip mall portion of this complex. Very little parking and hard to get in and out of. Staff is annoyed if you have questions and my order was wrong 2 of 2 visits. Thanks, but no more for me here!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Dec 15, 2014~Average location in just about every way. A little small and slightly awkward layout, but staff is friendly and customer service is on-par with other locations.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Aug 9, 2011~I still hate coffee. Why Starbucks then you ask? Easy. Smoothies and muffins. 1 extra star off for being on the west side. Ba-zing!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Feb 23, 2019~I just left this Starbucks and I'm frustrated. I went through the drive through this morning and ordered my normal drink: grande hot americano with 3 raw sugars, cinnamon and cream. When I got to the window I waited about 3 minutes for my drink which wasn't a big deal to me, they were really busy. But I kept hearing the girl at the window say `"do you have my americano?`" `" I just need the americano`" so when she handed me my drink I figured I better double check and make sure it was made right since they were probably rushing... I asked her very kindly, `"it for sure has the cinnamon in it?`" She looks at me, reads off of the sticker and says `"yeah, it has three raw sugar, extra cream and cinnamon`" (I could have read off of the sticker myself, I wanted to make sure that it was inside). So I go `"okay! Great! Thanks!`" I get down the road and take one sip... no cinnamon, no raw sugar and it's still dark brown with barely any cream. So I make a uturn, and go back. I'm not super upset but I'm a little annoyed at this point. So I say `"can you just make me a black americano and now that I'm inside, I'll just put the fixings in myself?`" and a different girl goes well I can just put the stuff in for you now. And I'm like.... okay. She does, I taste it again and it's just bad. It doesn't even taste like there's espresso in it. Let alone the 3 shots it should have, there's no crema and it tastes like cinnamon water. I say do you mind just remaking it for me? I'm just not a fan of how it tastes. With a heavy sigh and a glare up at me she literally says `"well your gonna have to wait because I have a lot of drinks in front of you`" REALLY?! I just went through the drive through, asked y'all to double check, you said it was right... you lied. And now I'm back in the store, I'm asking you to kindly remake my drink that you messed up. (You kind of messed it up twice!) and now instead of saying of course! I'm so sorry about that! Your upset at me for wanting the correct drink that I ordered 15 minutes ago?! I'm not usually one to write a complaint and I've worked at a coffee shop so I understand it gets stressful and things get forgotten in the drinks... but the way everything was handled was poor. She should have actually double checked that there was cinnamon and sugar in the drink when I asked and she should have been a little more understanding of why I would be asking her to remake the drink. I wasn't trying to be a pest, I was trying to get the drink that I had just paid for, correct.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Feb 19, 2015~Most disorganized poorly ran Starbucks I've ever been to in my life. I ordered my normal drink and stepped back from the counter, and after 10 minutes never received my order or heard my name called. I finally went up to ask the lady what was wrong. She said oh! Your drinks been done for 5 minutes. I asked her when, they were gonna let me know, she said we've been calling your name. I said how do you know my name you never even asked for my name? She said we got it off your credit card. It felt rather odd and impersonable I thought. She then told me that I was standing in the wrong spot and should know where the coffees picked up at. I told her I was standing here all this time watching, and listening. It took another 10 minutes for the girl to figure out how to refund my money... All in all, 20 minutes out of my day, stay far away from this Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Jun 4, 2014~Decent as far as Starbucks go. Kinda have to wait a while for things to come out even when they are not super busy.. Not bad at all just leave a bit to be desired.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Aug 28, 2014~This is my favorite store in the valley and I have visited more than should be normal. I go out of my way to visit this store because every barista, morning or evening, offer consistent service and quality beverages. They follow correct Starbucks routines and truly care about their customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Dec 31, 2014~My favorite coffee shop, great costumer service, the only bad thing about this place is the parking lot!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~May 30, 2017~I am extremely dissatisfied with the service here, I tried ordering my expresso venti  that I usually order from other Starbucks with no problems, but at this location they didn't  understand what I was saying and the girl working the drive through was impatient and rude and the manager was not listening to what I was saying, I would not recommend this location. I would go lower than one star if I could.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 25, 2015~Over-priced, fancy-schmancy coffee served by snotty, condencending  kids. Not worth it.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Apr 9, 2015~Used to frequent this spot a lot but the staff changed and they're just not as nice...moved on to a local spot a little closer to work...
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jun 28, 2014~I love this starbucks always fast and friendly they make the drinks amazing every time I go in my drinks taste the exact same never off .... Love the manager always has a smile on her face when you walk in ....
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Aug 27, 2016~This Starbucks has the worst service ever. I went in on a Saturday afternoon. It was very busy and you could tell in the employees faces they were tired. However it doesnt excuse how I was treated. I ordered a simple Trenta passion tea. I arrived at 12:04pm. I was put at 12:34pm. When I was handed my drink the employee saud trenta passion but handed me a venti. I advised this was the wrong size and the girl that was behind the counter said `"fine! We will make it again!`" then afyer her very rude comment waited an additional 5 min to ask someone to make it. I had no ice it wasnt sweetened. I have never had this bad of service at a Starbucks. Needless to say i will never return to this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jun 3, 2015~Free puppiccino for your dog (ice and whip cream)...nice outdoor seating, about 9 tables with shade and mist
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Feb 9, 2014~I've been coming to this Starbucks for years I've always had such a pleasant experience Tiffany the manager has always been so nice to me and my family! But ever since the girl named gray has started working there my experience has been nothing but terrible! She has been rude to me on several occasions I've complained to the manager and I won't complain to her anymore because I do not want a free drink all I'm asking for is for gray to pleasant to me when I go and buy my drink at six am! She has an Issue with me and I'm not sure why! She refuses to make my drink right and when I ask her to make it correctly she always come back with a snotty remark she make me feel as if I'm a bother to her. I just want one simple thing done I want my drink that I paid for made correctly! Because of the way I am treated by gray I will no longer come to this Starbucks neither will my friends and family I refuse to be treated with such disrespect again!
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Jul 14, 2024~Best Starbucks in the valley! The manager greets me often and always gives off positive vibes. All the workers seem to love there job. Plus my drink is always filled with caramel!!!! My go too is a venti caramel macchiato with extra extra caramel and blonde espresso
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Sep 15, 2022~The majority of the time the Starbucks is missing pretty much everything that a college student could want in the morning. I had an interaction with a manager who is completely rude. I'm shocked that she's managing a business where customer service is not only a high priority but required. The reason this gets even two stars is because the student workers are all very sweet and always very friendly.  They never fail to greet you with a smile and ensure you get the best drink or food you can with the minimal amount of options they can provide.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Jan 20, 2019~Just grabbed a Java chip frap to keep myself up tonight, thanks to Miles for making the first tasty one I've had since finding out I have milk allergy and had to switch to coconut milk! Love you Miles!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Nov 18, 2017~I see why this location gets bad reviews now. This is my first one star review I have wrote on yelp.I came in to find workers talking about how they don't care about their jobs at Starbucks and the only reason they are working here is for the free education. They were so engrossed in their conversation that I had to make my presence known for them to notice that I was there.The previous week I came in at 9:15 PM, that's 45 minutes before they close, and ordered my girlfriend's favorite drink that I was going to bring back to her. I was told that `"I already cleaned the machine that is used to make the drink`". Then I replied `"But you don't close for another 45 minutes`". His response to that was he would have to clean the machine again if he made my drink so he wasn't going to do that. So, I left and went to the location one mile down the road and got my drink there with no issues.It really seems like many of the individuals working here don't care about their jobs, give continued poor customer service and do as little as possible just so they get free education.After the continued bad experience here I am going avoid this location and would encourage others to do the same. Just go to the better run locations, like the one that is one mile away.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Oct 26, 2022~this starbucks should just close at this point, they never have anything, how do you not have cold brew or cream or mocha as a coffee shop? it's getting ridiculous
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Feb 18, 2020~I come in twice a week and love the environment! Always see my favorite barista, Richard and he is always friendly to my group. We joke he is an icon because he feels apart of the group now. Give Richard a raise!!!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Sep 27, 2019~Stopped in yesterday while at the ASU west campus, it was my first visit. The line was long but seemed to be going quickly so we decided to get an afternoon pick me up. I got to the counter to order and the individual who took my order immediately seemed annoyed or stressed, I asked for a grande iced green tea lemonade and before he started writing on the cup I said `"you know what let's do a venti if you would?`" He then seemed even more annoyed at which time he grunted as if it was a pain to grab the larger cup when he hadn't even written on the grande. I then went to scan my phone and he said `"whoa hold on!`" All in all, he needs to be better trained in customer service and act as if it is more of a pleasure to take someone's order than a hassle. My drink came out a few minutes later and it is a venti green tea latte? I let the nearest barista know that I had actually ordered a green tea lemonade, she didn't say anything to me and turned to the other barista and let her know what to make..a couple minutes later the younger barista placed my correct drink on the bar (somewhat aggressive) and the other one let me know that I could take both drinks and give one to someone I know. It was very bizarre and nothing like what I am used to from Starbucks. For starters they made me feel like the drink mistake was my fault which was weird...then didn't even apologize or anything (despite the fact that they actually charged me for a more expensive drink?)I am not one to complain and honestly I don't make things like this a big deal. If the drink order was incorrect but they handled it better it would have been no sweat off my back..it was just my interaction with the entire staff that rubbed me the wrong way. Honestly I would avoid this Starbucks and go to one off campus (even if it's not as convenient!)
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Feb 13, 2017~Idk why this place has gotten a higher star rating, seems crazy to me!! The Barista at the window was super friendly and helped me out a lot. I'm not a big coffee drinker so I don't frequent here a lot, but this is a really nice clean place.
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Aug 31, 2017~Mediocre service on taking my order but then the little dark haired curly girl serving decided to do 3 other orders before completing mine. Terrible service!!!
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~May 19, 2018~My favorite Starbucks to hang out at! My service animal is also allowed in and loved, which is important to me. Thanks for all the delicious coffee!
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Feb 23, 2018~Being an ASU student, I'm on campus constantly and use the campus Starbucks for a pick me up of coffee daily. The employees are usually very pleasant and get my order out ASAP and correctly! I usually get a coffee and some banana bread- my go to items!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Sep 4, 2016~Don't waste your time or money here. I live for Starbucks but this place is crazy.  The drive thru is super full so I walked in. Ton of space inside.  Surprised not one person was in there. Ryan happily helped me and wanted to charge me almost $4.00 for a cup of coffee.  I asked him why it was so much and he started reading off everything. He said they charge for creamer.  Keep driving to the next one. Ryan doesn't know what he is doing.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Nov 19, 2017~I'll choose this Starbucks over all other ones! Staff are super friendly, service is efficient and drinks are always top notch. I've witnessed them change drinks for customers that weren't satisfied multiple times.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Apr 6, 2017~The fact that I have never written a Yelp review before, regardless of how awful the experience was, and now I am writing the my first one, tells you about how disappointed I am with this branch. Some workers seem to have a little trouble with understanding the concept of customer service. Although it is at a college setting and can be a little more `"relaxed`" than if it were off-campus, it is expected that the employees still treat their customers with respect whether they are a student, a staff member, or whatever the case may be. I barely know these baristas and they play around and joke with me like they have known me for years, which to some extent I tolerate but it can sometimes be very frustrating and plain disrespectful. Instead of saying that they have the right to refuse service when clearly they had initiated the altercation, they might want to try apologizing. People with common sense know better not to mess with someone who is hungry, to which I did give a warning.
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Nov 19, 2013~Disappointed in this Starbucks. Employees had little knowledge of menu, pricing of pastries,  and got my drink wrong. A simple hot coffee. I would rather drive further to a different location than to this one. The only reason it got 2 stars was because the cashier was polite and the premade bliss bar was good.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Aug 23, 2017~This place is terribly disorganised. The employees are unprofessional and inept. Spend your money elsewhere.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Sep 4, 2016~Horrible horrible!! Venti pikes place with 3 pumps of white mocha and an inch of cream. Almost $4. They charge for a pump of white mocha in your coffee.  Fine. I get it. Gotta keep the lights on right?! I asked why it's so much and they said they had to charge me for the cream.  So it's  $1.20 to add white mocha and cream to a black coffee.  Wow. Floored. Never coming back.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 2, 2023~Great SBUX! Clean, amazing staff, well laid out. Noice!I am visiting PHX and the quality of this store at this location was a very pleasant surprise.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jul 3, 2022~No line for some reason and I zipped through to enjoy an iced caramel drink for about 5 bucks, which is the low end price of almost all grande beverages now. This was cold, had the right amount of cream,but the caramel needed to be stirred. If you choose the no straw, then stirring becomes difficult.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 10, 2024~can never get my simple drink right, all i ask for is a strawberry açaí refresher with no strawberries and extra base, the worker ALWAYS fails to add the extra base and makes sure it's watered down completely. today was the last straw and i will no longer be going to this crappy location, i recommend you take your money and do the same.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 5, 2019~Great Starbucks! There's a drive thru! Love the caramel frap. But there's a lot of choices lattes, cold brews, frappuccino's and teas. Download the app to start making ur order online and it will be done by the time u drive there. Also there's always star dashes going on to earn more stars to earn free drinks or food.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 15, 2022~Great service, clean, friendly baristasWhen coming in I was greeted and felt welcomed
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 27, 2020~Wow. That's literally all I can say. I went to this location this morning to get myself and my son drinks and breakfast. My gift card didn't work, no worries, whatevs.... but they didn't even start my drinks (talking where I could hear them talking about how they won't start them until they know I could pay for them, so rude) then I sat at the window after paying cash for ten minutes while they make my order.... all the while goofing around and being inappropriate with each other, then finally my drink came out.... wrong. I ordered it iced, when I said something, one of the girls inside rudely said `"well then she should have ordered it iced`" loudly... Then the manager Zulma came to give me a refund.... not only was she not wearing her mask over her nose, she was barely any help at all and let the lady inside keep yelling rude things... I could hear them through the headset as she was wearing. When I asked for the store manager, the girl who was rude to begin with literally sneered `"looks like you'll have to come back in a week, she's on vacation, he name is Jo, I can give you my card for when you complain about me`" Zulma barely even tried to get her to stop verbally harassing a customer.... If I could give zero stars I would... there are so many Starbucks in the same area... choose a different location...
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Mar 2, 2018~The cup has runneth over. Lived near this store for over a year and every time I find myself regretting it. Thats pretty sad right because it's Starbucks. What happened Starbucks? It seems as though the Starbucks customer service here is inexistent. The employees seem to have a very low morale as if no one there wants to be there and the drinks made mirrors that. I truly believe this store likes good leadership, its almost as if no one wants to really work there. I've never been to a Starbucks where they don't seem happy, I was under the impression the hiring process involved a picking of personalities that are chipper. This store for the past year has lacked personality. Where is the love? The seating in this store is a full 4 stars small, its small but it makes do with the square footage that they have. If you plan to bring a computer and sit at the long table the many outlets are under the table so be sure to look. The drinks seem to lack love, over multiple occasions I've gotten drinks with others and the drinks taste extremely similar. I usually ALWAYS order through the app, my recommendation is you download the Starbucks app and make purchases through it as you will receive TONS of bonuses and free drinks. It's unfortunate this Starbucks couldn't FILL the cup up, I expected more. This store lacks smiles and spirit, one day I hope that changes.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jan 19, 2022~I give 3 stars for this visit. 1 star off because I got ZERO drizzle on my caramel machiatto, pretty simple order. No dog treats on any of my 3 puppaccino. They were upset about that, theres the other star. I think the simplest orders are the most important to hit the mark on. A good correct coffee in the morning sets the day right, but a wrong one you will think about longer.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 24, 2022~Omg if I ever need to recommend a awesome starbucks it's this one. The people- outstanding kind and sweet, as well as make drinks so fast you'll be in and out. Nissa was so awesome and went the extra mile! Def go here yall, it's amazing!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 3, 2021~I love how this Starbucks always makes it right. Too much ice? Ask for light ice.  Danish not to your liking?  Ask for a remake. Drinks are guaranteed so if you dont like it just ask for a remake. Seems like some people just love to complain.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 11, 2022~I've been ordering from this Starbucks through Postmates a lot the last couple of months and never had an issue. Yesterday morning I ordered a sugar free vanilla iced coffee and it was BAD. It tasted like one of the ingredients was bad but I'm not sure which one, most likely the syrup because it tasted extremely fermented. I had two other people try it and they both had the same reaction.  Not sure I'll order from here again because that was a complete waste of my money.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 26, 2021~I asked for a double toasted cheese danish and the first one I got wasn't cooked at all, the second one was torched! Horrible Starbucks...couldn't even make a simple iced caramel macchiato correctly. Don't go to this one! 0 STARS!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~May 24, 2016~Not sure why other reviewers had such bad service here. Maybe I came in a good day. My coffee was made super fast even though there were cars lined up around the corner outside. Minus one star due to dirty tables outside. I hate cleaning tables when I'm out; I do that enough at home.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 8, 2020~This is the only Starbucks I've had delivery from that does NOT secure the delivery items before providing to the delivery driver. What is wrong with you??? Follow Starbucks and safety guidelines and have some common decency - don't leave food items to the open air of a delivery driver during a pandemic when it's easy enough to tape the bag. It's a waste of $40. Extremely disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Mar 3, 2021~Ok I'm giving 4 stars because most of my experiences at this location have been great. The staff are great. But today I was extremely disappointed in paying $12 for two drinks that were 99% ice. All ice no drink. 3 sips and they were GONE. So sad.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 7, 2019~Time for an update. I usually make coffee at home, however once in a while I run out and have to hit this Starbucks for my morning cup of coffee. Everything is on point compared to when I first reviewed back in 2013. Their coffee tastes good, service is great and they always offer my dog a puppicino.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Mar 10, 2013~Closest Starbucks to my house and the WORST Starbucks in town! They mess up the simplest of orders and have attitude when they can't figure out how to fix a problem. I have to drive an extra 5 minutes to the next closest Starbucks(40th and Greenway) but it is worth it because they are awesome-always get it right-and their coffee does not taste like I licked an ashtray!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 7, 2018~Great Starbucks. Watch out for this ass hole that frequents this Starbucks. He is rude and acts like he wants to fight no matter if your a woman or a man and he has a Veyo magnet on his card. See three photos of him in the photo line up.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 3, 2021~This location is great! I have been a loyal customer for a few years and even with a manager change they are still on their A Game. There are still a few great old schoolers left like Neil and Tiffany and I'm sure a few others I'm blanking on, then there are newer baristas like Joseph and Kim who know how to do all the right things in the customer service oriented business. By far the best and my favorite of all of the valley Starbucks locations. Keep up the great work everyone!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 27, 2016~Not all Starbucks are created equal but this one is one of my favorites!The store and bathroom is always clean. The coffee drinks are always spot on and consistent. The staff is always warm and welcoming and treat you like a friend. Depending on which way I'm traveling I may not stop here but when I'm in N Phoenix this is my go to!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~May 24, 2017~This a busy location because it's near the 51 freeway. The employees are always nice and greet you are out a smile. Even when the drive thru line is super long or once a customers vehicle stalled out and held up the drive thru, the employees were super nice and accommodating. Last week Mia was a gem at the drive thru. She started a nice conversation with me while I waited for my order. Great customer service!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 11, 2017~This Starbucks Rocks! They always have my drink ready quickly when I order ahead! Also they keep the drive-thru moving in the am (unlike some stores where they put the `"B`" team on at busiest times).
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Mar 16, 2015~This is my go to Starbucks and I have never been disappointed. The employees are all very nice and friendly. I love that there is a drive thru which makes it easy to get to go. To me the drive thru is pretty quick.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 14, 2020~Just love this place .What a clean open fast paced environment The staff was very friendly and was efficient at getting my order right &amp; I was  impressed at how fast the staff moved right through the line with ease . The  employees work together and lift the whole environment on such a  positive note. The sitting area has plenty of space to sit down and enjoy your goodies while catching up on your laptop or tablet they offer Free wifi Bonus locations great plus I've yet to see a line in the drive through. The coffee is delish and the service is  worthly and they even WROTE my name on my cup . Definitely have my loyal customer vote I'm a patron . Recommend for everyone , family environment and there's something for everyone .I've been to several of there locations and there everywhere I stand by in saying all there locations are the same and keep the same standers of service in my experience with them Thank you again very pleased customer
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 6, 2015~Drinks aren't consistent, and the employees are always rude. I'm surprised Dutch brothers hasn't put them out of business... Yet If I'm paying 5$ for a drink I'm expecting it to be perfect. When I took my drink back they told me I didn't purchase the drink from there location and unless I had the receipt they couldn't replace it...I still haven't been back
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 12, 2019~So I go to this Starbucks daily at 32nd St. and Bell and normally it's awesome everyone is really friendly my mobile order is ready on time. Today I picked up my mobile order and there was a new face the gentleman was nice handed me my drink and then turned around and bent over and now I am faced with his green boxer shorts because his bluejeans are below his ass. Seriously Starbucks? You can't make your help at least wear jeans up at their waist rather than below their underwear?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Oct 1, 2018~This location was pretty busy when I went on a Friday morning.  There are no comfortable seats to sit and relax, read or work.  All wooden chairs.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 10, 2015~Tall guy with blonde hair that works there has no personality. Never has. He may hate his job but it is his job to fake it and if you can't then customer service isn't for you. This guy is never happy every time I go in. Normally I don't care but he's ruining the barista reputation. He messed up my drink, didn't give me my current change back and then acted like I was ruining his life by asking for the correct change. Starbucks needs to fix this. It's embarrassing.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 26, 2015~Went to Starbucks to get a Trenta Black Ice Tea while I was placing my order I let the lady know (heather) I wanted extra water so it wasn't to strong.Pulled up to the window only to find a dark strong tea. I said can you please put more water with an attitude heather said `"it is a black tea you know`" and walked away. Heather came back with a tea that she didn't even add water to and I said I don't want the tea and I don't like your attitude she said `"good for you bye`". So my husband pulled forward and I went inside for the managers number the woman who working he purchase counter gave me a car and was very nice.Needless to say I notified corporate and will call the store manager tomorrow.Heather is very rude and needs to find a new job not in customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 7, 2018~Bathrooms were disgusting. Behind the bar was also dirty. They didn't label coffees so people that came after me kept taking mine. I finally got mine and it tasted disastrous. 4 dollars down the drain. I'm going to dutch brothers from here.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jun 12, 2020~The barista was very sweet but I would avoid this Starbucks until they let their customers use the bathrooms. I understand there's a virus going around but if they're really that concerned for our safety then they should shut the place down until it doesn't exist anymore... So forever. Or they can stop using the excuse of `"we can't let you use the bathrooms because of the coronavirus`". It literally doesn't make any sense that you will take our money and hand us food and drink but not let us use the bathroom. Starbucks and their politics. So frustrating.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jun 4, 2018~This location is really hit or miss. I come *almost* every morning, and maybe 1/4 of the time my order is wrong. Also, you'd think they take time to know their regulars--- nope! There are a couple friendly people that work the drive through counter--- but I'm not impressed. I don't need the overboard `"Dutch bros`" friendly, but a hello and smile could go a long way.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Mar 31, 2017~As good as any other Starbucks - which is to say overpriced but of high quality. Fast friendly service.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 29, 2018~Good Starbucks, drinks alway taste right.  Good folks in that store who want to take care of you.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 15, 2018~Horrible customer service. I tried paying with large bill, they had no change! I offered to pay partially in change and come back and pay the rest. They much rather trash the already made beverage than to keep customer happy. I rather go across the street to the Starbucks inside Fry's or even better Kings independently and locally owned coffee shop on 32nd St and Union Hills.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 25, 2017~I am always disappointed when I leave this location. Unfortunately, it is closest to my job so I have no time to drive further before work. The drive-thru line gets jammed often, but that it isn't the real issue. I used to be a manager for Starbucks and I worked in all types of stores, so I know how operations go. My drinks are rarely correct &amp; I order uncomplicated recipes. Vanilla latte with whipped cream? No whipped cream. 1/2 sweet mocha? Made with 4 pumps and too sweet. We can't leave work to go back and have these drinks corrected, so we deal with it. I know what Starbucks is capable of and I really wish this location would improve. Staff is normally kind, but efficiency needs some serious work.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Mar 3, 2015~My second favorite coffee shop in the north valley, they are really fast. I would recommend the peppermint mocha or the skinny vanilla latte
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~May 30, 2012~Small inside, but they also have a drive through. I love this Starbucks because its such a convenient location, right before the 51.I came a couple times to study before school and used the free wifi, They still offer the free iTunes cards too. I'm a rare person who drinks tea from here, so my drinks aren't expensive (in the $2-$4 range) whether it's hot or iced.I haven't had any issues with the baristas.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 15, 2013~A friendly staff, great location, and big inside.  This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations.  Well the one on 16th and Bethany is my favorite, but this one is up there...!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 13, 2016~Not even a 1-  inside cashier pleasant but drive thru baristas very rude. So however was working 8/13/16 at 11:50am, put a smiley face on and be happy.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 1, 2016~This Starbucks has employees that are extremely rude. I asked for extra Carmel drizzle and instead of putting extra they left it out. I went back inside and asked them to put Carmel in it and put a little more than normal. The girl gave me a dirty look and proceeded to fill the cup 1/3 of the way with Carmel making it undrinkable. I wasn't rude when I asked so I don't understand why I was treated like that. I definitely won't be back here.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 14, 2015~Agree with previous posters the customer service is terrible don't even know their own promotions very disappointed especially when you spend $7 for a cup of coffee, someone needs to manage up this location and manage out these employees who act so rudely.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 26, 2017~Early morning today, I bought a vanilla soy latte at this locations. I drink soy because I am severely lactose intolerant. I went to work and half an hour after drinking the latte, I ran to the bathroom. The latte was the only thing I ate therefore I believe that by accident the barista put regular milk. Not only did I pay $.65 for it but got sick too!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 21, 2016~How does a `"Coffee Master`" (embroidered on their aprons) not know that they sell prepared 8-cup presses of COFFEE ready to serve in a Clover-Reserve location and has to call a district manager to ask if they sell them and how prepare them?!? You grind 8-10 tablespoons of beans with 'press' as a preset mode on the actual grinder, add hot water to the top of the black part of the press, set a timer for 4 minutes, and press down when the time is up. Instructions are on the French presses you sell! Teach your `"Coffee Masters`" to make a simple press of coffee before teaching them to master `"handcrafted beverage`" junk.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 24, 2015~My bf and i went there on christmas eve and the girl at the register was the sweetest cashier we encountered. I did not catch her name but we went at 9:57am when everyone decided to show up and everyone was swift and very nice. I am very happy with the service and product! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 29, 2018~i'm always hesitant to go to other stores, because as a 2.5 year partner i get the quality has gone down. this store surprised me with quick drive times and while maintaining great customer service!! thank you so much for keeping the quality of stores at a high, all stores should look at this one as an example
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 3, 2015~This is my go to Starbucks. Staff is always friendly and easy going. Most people need to realize that it takes some time to make orders, the drive thru can get long but it's worth the wait in my opinion. Always clean and plenty of seating. I frequent this store about once a week.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Feb 1, 2017~Too bad the door slams really very loudly and the wonderful and inviting work table has 2 rows of NONFUNCTIONAL electrical outlets.  Clean and comfortable otherwise.  Too bad they don't repair these two annoying issues.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 6, 2017~Avoid this Starbucks, ordered my mobile order and took 10 minutes, most other locations I can order 5 minutes ahead (like I did), walk in and skip the line.  After I asked she looked at the cup that was set aside and set it after people who ordered after me! On top of that there were 4 other customers who got their drinks wrong in the time I waited. I've been here a few times after class and never have a good experience. The only reason I went this time is cause the person driving me only wanted to make a fast stop.. I was wrong about fast that's for sure! I felt like an ass making the person driving me wait so long. I'll never come back, not worth the service as wait, plus the drink wasn't even that great
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 8, 2015~If I can give it negative stars I would. I have never been to such a terrible location ever. They were beyond rude and careless at this location. I watched 6 people get their drinks ahead of me. A few customers mentioned it happens all the time. When I mentioned that I still hadn't received my drink the barista rolled her eyes and said out loud that I hadn't received my drink. I stood there watching as they worked on other people's drinks not seeming to attempt to make mine even after it was announced that I hadn't received mine. I get fed up and at this point I'm already late for my appointment with a client so I tell them I want a refund and that I do not even care about the drink. Barista then turns around grabs the drink stating someone moved it and forgot about it. I tell them I'm very unhappy and that this has been a bad experience...in a very uncaring tone, eyes rolling again she just says sorry. As im walking out very upset one of the other Baristas (I'm assuming he was the supervisor since he was not wearing the green apron) shouts in a sarcastic demeaning tone HAVE A GOOD DAY and gives a chuckle. Asking if he was serious. He continued to have a smirk on his face as he chuckled. Told them this is the worst Starbucks I have ever been too and that the customer service is terrible...Barista screamed BYE in a joyful tone. I have never been so disgusted by a business like I was today. It was so bad that it left a bad taste in my mouth for Starbucks in general. I hope that if I decide to go back to a different Starbucks that they can restore my faith.In case you want to say drinks take a while to make take into consideration I only asked for an iced green tea and the 6 drinks from different people standing behind me got their drinks before me.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 18, 2016~Great service and always fast and friendly especially in the drive thru. My everyday stop to start my day.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 13, 2013~Fast in the drive thru....awesome service. baristas are so friendly and nice
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 28, 2018~An amazingly friendly staff! I went on Black Friday through the drive thru and the server was so cheery and patient with me as I scrambled to get me electronic pay to work. After about 5 mins of sheer panic on my part, the sweet server said she paid for me. I couldn't believe the generosity. Of course I thanked her a million times. And after running to my appointment I returned an hour later and paid. Such a great place with incredible staff! HIGHLY recommend!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 28, 2018~Go here 5 days in a row, order the same drink all 5 days, and all 5 days your drink will be different ... no consistency at all. Vanilla iced coffee with cream, how simple is that right. One day the drink will be almost white cause it's nothing but creamier, the next it wont have any creamer, so on and so on. Aren't they supposed to have a `"standard`" amount of cream when you order cream and not just rush to make a crappy drink... slow down, make my drink right. Maybe 1 day out of the 5 my drink will actually be good... I'll try out the new location on union, maybe they'll know how to measure cream so you get the same drink daily...
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 4, 2009~I usually don't write reviews for huge chains like this, but sometimes you just gotta vent.  Hit the drive-thru on Black Friday with the wife.  I ordered a Venti (large) caramel brulee latte, while she got a Tall (small) Pep Mocha latte.  The total was approximately $8.  I roll up to the window, and hand the cashier a $5 plus a coupon for one free drink.  I'd assume that she'd take off the most expensive one, or at least ask, but no, she didn't ask.  So I was expecting about $1 plus change, and was surprised when the cashier gave me $.18.  I questioned which drink she took off, wondering why the venti wasn't the free drink.  Her rational to me was that 'it wasn't that big of a difference because both drinks are about $4'.  I questioned her, specifically asking her if venti and tall drinks really cost the same.  She insisted that yes they did.  Of course, she proceeded to hand me the receipt, I saw that was false (which I already knew).  Yes, it was only a dollar, but this was a complete and utter customer service failure.  If I had not said anything, I could understand, but I questioned which drink she took off and she either lied to me, or was too incompetent to know the price difference.  Additionally, annoying is that I promptly sent an email to Starbucks customer service and a full week later, I have not received a response.  Zero stars to this location and zero stars for no email response from Starbucks corporate.UPDATE:  I'm upgrading this location to a half of a star.  Starbucks corporate finally contacted me about my letter about 10 days or so after I sent it.  While the email they sent me was apologetic, they did not answer any of my questions about Starbucks policy.  Lame.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Dec 9, 2012~As much as I love Starbucks this location is inconsistent in their customer service. The staff is impatient and often makes us feel as if we are inconveniencing them. We go there often since it is close by and just today encountered another example of this.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Sep 19, 2014~It chaps my hide to see their signs in the coffee 'drop' machines offering varying roasts , only to hear them say `"All we have is Pike Place right now`", well then take the stupid signs down!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 12, 2015~Dont ever go on a sunday walked in 30min before closing time saw the employee kind of pissed off because I walked in, was not greeted and I asked to see if I could buy a bread and I was told they were for tomorrow lol it probably only took them 2 minutes to heat that shit up. That afternoon/sunday staff really needs some work
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Feb 21, 2014~I think two stars might be stretching the reality of the service that takes place at this particular Starbucks. It never ceases to amaze me how Starbucks walks its own customers out for lack of service and care
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 1, 2013~Poop on this place. They are not happy and don't have the Starbuck's service we are use too. I am very disappointed. Also because I only had a fifty the service level sunk even lower as I had to inconvenience them with making change. Amazing as busy as it was there were no $20's in the drawer so I got all $1's and 5's for my $46 plus in change.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Dec 20, 2017~Long time customer but will no longer use this Starbucks. Taking much longer to get my order including during slow times with hardly any business. This week they almost forgot my oatmeal on a pick up order and the blueberries were moldy!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 1, 2018~If I could offer a -1 star for this location specially I'd probably say it still wouldn't justify the service. This is the last time I would ever consider this location. I'm all about having off days but if every time I'm here is an off day some major revaluation needs to be preformed. Today's visit consisted of placing my mobile order and walking in to what seemed to be a silent movie. Not a single barista even acknowledge me of the 6 working. To then finding my mobile order wrong (after I had to ask regarding my order I couldn't locate). If I was a executive at Starbucks I'd be ripping all elements of my brand from this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 26, 2013~DUH!  Starbucks hires only the best!  Always fast, friendly service
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 4, 2016~i used to like Starbucks and get my coffee every morning but the service is terrible speciality on this location!! the barristas are super rude INSIDE AND DRIVE TRU they really need a good manager . i had a few bad experiences that make me decide NOT TO GO BACK to Starbucks tanks to the personal that works in this location. I love DUTCH BROS THEY REALLY APRECIATE THEIR COSTUMERS!!!  AND HAVE VALUES......
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 28, 2015~This location is always packed in the mornings. But they have a drive thru. Their breakfast sandwiches leave much to be desired, but the muffins and coffee cakes are delicious. They are our Sunday treats.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 4, 2015~LACKS of customer service but then again that goes for most of the Starbucks in Arizona now a days.Because of that Starbucks is marking their own grave,because well let's all face it if you haven't heard of Dutch bros and you live in Arizona it basically means you live under a rock don't know about you but next time I want coffee I'll be going to Dutch bros.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Apr 3, 2014~Coffee, coffee, and more coffee.  Gotta have it. Love the people that work at this location, we always banter back and forth like nutballs.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 29, 2014~We frequent this location on the weekends on our way out for the day.  The drive through is usually quick, although there have a handful of times they've messed up our drink order.  On the whole though they do a good job with the drinks, and the food is always fresh.  We've also been in a few times, and the experience is similar.  The staff are friendly, and the place is clean.  It's definitely one of the smaller SB locations.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jul 1, 2016~Worst Starbucks! I always place mobile orders at any Starbucks and i usually walk straight to the pickup counter and the staff always acknowledges me and quickly asks if I'm the mobile order. This Starbucks however ignored me while i stood there and waited for someone to look in my direction. After about 5 min Finally one girl says are you the mobile order? Then she follows it with a very rudely said `"well you don't have to stand there just say something`" as shes making someone else's drink. I didn't appreciate the remark as i am the customer and you should be aware of who is in the waiting area at all times. Not to mention she didn't look at me when she said it she looked at the other customer waiting.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Aug 10, 2011~Another one of my favorite locations. Nice friendly staff, helpful and forgiving if you make a stupid mistake!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 23, 2013~I went here before a movie and got an iced coffee.  I asked if they would honor the refill price if I came back after the movie and was exited when they said yes.  I thought I had a new pre-movie routine since I go to the harkins across the street often.  I went back and was now told I need to pay full price.  The gal I talked to before was no longer working.  They wouldn't honor the refill price when I explained what I was told earlier.  That's horrible customer service!  Won't be coming back!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Sep 3, 2014~I have the same issue with this Starbucks as with a fee others that cannot seem to get a sweet iced coffee with cream right :/ Everything else I've had there is okay.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Mar 22, 2015~There's one drink that this Starbucks makes right, but any other time I come through the drive thru, however, they always seem to mess up any other drink I order. They never put the special things I specifically ask for. I asked, and repeated myself twice, for lemonade in my drink. Yet, oddly enough there was no lemonade in my drink. I've gone back and had them remade and fixed, but I'm so sick of them not being able to read a sticker and follow directions. I would definitely not recommend this Starbucks location, unless you like going back and forth and wasting your time, gas, and breath on something so simple and easy to follow.However, the ladies that are often at the window are very kind. The males however, could careless about what you have to say and they don't really smile or have a personality.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 5, 2015~No no no no no no..........I live near This location and have gone here a lot. 1 out of 10 times they get the order right. Unfortunately other locations are out of my way. I can't wait to move in a month and hopefully find a better location. This one is horrible. They can't even follow the instructions that are laid out for them to make a coffee with the right amount of syrup or sweetener. And ordering a sweetened iced green tea and forgetting to sweeten it is unforgivable. I just don't understand what's wrong with this location. Maybe it's the training or lack thereof. I hope they get better, but I won't ever find out because this is the last time I'll ever go there.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 5, 2015~Terrible customer service ever!!! Not helpful at all.. You can tell the employees hate their job.  I was there for the 3 dlls frappes promo and the barista seemed not to know what I was talking about. I end up paying double and upset because the way I was treated.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 17, 2014~I have had a few drinks that have been made incorrect, and lets not mention the fact that half of their breakfast sandwiches are never available... but today was the last straw...  There employees tonight were beyond loud and obnoxious when a handful of people where trying to drink coffee and work.  New Management needed ASAP.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 19, 2014~They are busy like everyone says, but it's pretty obvious that they try their best and move quickly. Always polite, always accurate!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 21, 2014~awesome store, friendly employees, and a really fast drive thru. my favorite location in the valley!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 21, 2015~I am a daily starbucks drinker and I alwats go.through drive thru. Whenever I go through there, my favorite person who works there is Peter. He's always very helpful and very sweet. He's the only reason I enjoy coming to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 10, 2022~I tried to purchase cups at this Starbucks they had none out so I asked the employee and he said yes they have cups in the back but the manager told him to put those back because those are his.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 27, 2020~The Starbucks girl is so rude, she threw my change on the counter the first time I was there and my matcha latte tasted Iike it was just milk so I was like maybe she had a bad day, I stopped in a week later to grab a coffee and she didn't say one word when I went to the counter as if I was bothering her then I asked if she had a tip jar she ignored me, I got a caramel macchiato which again tasted like milk and there was no caramel. I'm sorry but if I'm going to pay 5-8 for a drink at least make it right. I would highly recommend going to another Starbucks. Horrible.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 20, 2019~Wish i could put ZERO stars. It's not that hard to take an order. I ordered a simple ice tea and the girl guys `"WHAT THE WHAT`" I'm sorry to you need to learn a little bit of customer service. It's fine if you do not know all the teas or specials drinks whatever but a little of customer service is not that hard. Your taking a simple order for goodness sakes.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 9, 2019~Went there for the green tea Matcha frap deal they had today the girl named Ashley told me that I need the app so I told her I'm going to back up out of the drive through and download it I downloaded it and then added my card. I came back ordered it and I asked her a very simple question on if I need to load money onto the card because I didn't know I've never used the app before and then she got mad rolled her eyes at me and told me `"whatever I don't feel like dealing with this`" `"I'll just charge you the same`" with my debit card. When all I asked what a very simple question that would have taking me seconds to put what I needed on there. Instead I got attitude from her cause I guess my time isn't as valuable as hers. Definitely won't ever be back at this location and sucks cause I work right by it
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 20, 2024~I just had the BEST Carmel Ribbon Crunch from Starbucks. It's my favorite and Ashley made it the best hands down!!!! Everything was perfect including her and the service!! ThxExtra drizzle &amp; Crunch
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 25, 2024~great service and understanding staff. Disgruntled costumer being crass and belligerent with manager she kept her cool and offered to remake drink, even when costumer needed a dose of reality.  Good job. I couldn't deal with these Karen's.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 9, 2024~Each Starbucks has their own charm yet consistently good at almost each and every location. This location is clean, friendly and fast!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 10, 2024~I'll never go to this Starbucks again. Luke warm drip coffee and staff with an attitude. I'm over it.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 26, 2024~My GO TO Starbucks!!! Always fast service, great baristas and love the seating inside!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 22, 2023~Terrible customer service! Extremely unhelpful! When you place a mobile order you would expect to be able to pick it up in the store. People place mobile orders because they are in a hurry to get somewhere, usually work, and we don't have time to go through a long line. Well to my surprise the lobby was closed so when a group of customers is waiting at the door they don't want to be told to get back in their cars and wait in line. Especially when we can see the drinks right behind you and you refuse to hand them to your customers! Maybe turn off your mobile ordering!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 31, 2024~oh my goodness, this used to be such a great location and in the last month, it has been horrible. i've come back multiple times to try to give them another chance and i've spent a cumulative time of 1 hr and 36 minutes in this drive through within only 3 visits. the employees give horrible attitude, mess up orders, and make faces at customers through the window if we look impatient. if you have somewhere else to be in a timely manner, do NOT come here. you'll be here all day. so sad to see it in such decline
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 12, 2023~I order a cookies &amp; creams venti they got my order wrong three times!! I spoke up and red it out clear they still had my order wrong.... Still I ended up with horrible drink watery &amp; the cookie crumble floating on top. I hate paying for something that I didn't ask for or can't enjoy.. then they continue to laugh in my face like it was funny... get it together !!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Nov 5, 2022~Check your order before you leave. I waited 10 minutes in the drive-thru despite placing a mobile order.I saw the car in front of me take a baked good and hand it back to the employee, who then apologized. I think the item was incorrect or it was(n't) warmed up.When I got to the window, they tried to hand me a venti iced drink when I ordered a tall hot soy chai. It's concerning the orders were wrong for two cars in a row. My drink tasted fine, but I wondered if they incorrectly made my drink with milk. I can't have dairy, so I guess we'll find out shortly?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jan 14, 2023~Tried a mobile order here. Waited 5 mins before I left home so everything should be ready right? It's a 7-10 min drive. I get there and everything is ready except the veranda coffee which is fine I know they usually don't have it. They told me they just have Pike and I said that's fine just a venti coffee of any type. I see them go over and dump the coffee meaning no one is keeping up on it (they're busy but also have 6-7 baristas and one of their jobs is floater and their #1 priority is to make sure to brew every 10 mins). Then I see them place my cup under one and hit brew which is a 5 minute process.They had plenty of time to anticipate me coming for this coffee and shouldn't have to prepare if they're abiding by Starbucks policy and standards.{I worked at Sky Harbor with 2-3 baristas total and had a better grip on operations just as busy if not more.}I politely mentioned to the barista I would gladly take a venti Americano instead because I'm trying to get back home (I'm not about to wait 5 mins for a mobile order that should be done, basic coffee, and my iced drink is melting). He said `"you just have to wait 30 seconds`" and proceeded to pour coffee into the cup that's only been brewed 1.5 minutes.If you know anything about coffee that's a big no-no. He just forced me to take a half-***ed coffee that's bitter and imbalanced because it's not had time to fully extract and brew properly instead of giving me an alternative that I offered to become a satisfied customer and overcome the issue that was *his* mistake of being behind. {When I was a barista I always offered Americanos as an alternative if I was out of coffee or had any timely issue or didn't have decaf brewed coffee. It's really not a big deal.}He handed me the coffee and told me thank you for your patience and I said thanks. I'm sure he was being sarcastic since I said I was trying to leave. The coffee is bitter.My trainer at Starbucks said brewed coffee is the namesake of any coffee shop and should always be something you're good on as such. Maybe they should review the basics of coffee at this location or train their baristas to offer alternatives if they've messed up or if they are out of something, it is the absolute best way to earn back someone's business who received less-than standard service. Literally every other Starbucks goes by this principle. `"Let us make this right for you.`" Not `"drink this bitter *** coffee.`" Lmao.Once again this location is lackluster service even with new baristas there.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Feb 13, 2022~The drinks are usually made right. I'm just making this review because the store is usually not too busy inside, and yet I never seem to be greeted or welcomed between at least 6 employees working behind the counter. I worked at Starbucks for a year in 2010 (the good ol' days) and I would never ignore a customer. I had a great time every day I worked there because it's a fun job! People are excited to go there! The occasional Karen complaining about their drink is just another challenge to make their drink better, they will praise you if you redeem the situation right with respect and patience.Even when I went up to the cashier they just stared at me silently until I ordered, and this is the kind of vibe that seems to be the norm at all locations now. They weren't rude but everyone's just silent and lifeless the whole time. Why can't anyone just be human and say hello to their customers and ask them how their day is going? Is everyone so woke that they're just always grumpy in defense mode waiting to be offended even at a service job that's supposed to be fun and upbeat? One of the baristas was literally just standing around in the middle the entire time I was in the store. Just dancing around and chatting other baristas up, but no one ever looks beyond their work station or the counter. I give people the benefit of the doubt and I'm always willing to forgive which is why I'm still giving 3 stars and won't tell you not to go here but Starbucks has just not been the same awesome place I remember in the last 2 years at any location I've been to. It's always this awkward experience where I feel unwelcome or non existent to the employees who just look uninspired and like they just rolled out of bed and put a green apron on. Black rock coffee and local places put them to shame when compared side-by-side. Shoot even making a cup at home seems more worth it. I only go here for a treat for my girl or my kiddos, not for me.A smile would be nice, a warm greeting would be progress, and some semblance of humanity would help justify the purpose of leaving my house to get pricey drinks.Not saying this because I think I'm so important that I need constant acknowledgement, just saying this as a spectator of coming to Starbucks randomly the last 2 years and being generally unimpressed by the service and just not understanding why it's so difficult to be nice to people. In my time at Starbucks I borrowed at at least 10 different locations around the Valley and they were pretty consistent in being awesome in service and quality and personality. I wouldn't say don't come here because I'll still go here for fun sometimes but I just hope they work on their people skills for their own sakes and life paths. There's no reason to be short with others unless they're being rude or unreasonable about their drink etc. There's no reason to get so bitter in life that you can't try to make someone else's day and become so self-absorbed you can't see past your own nose. It's a bad look for Starbucks and honestly makes me kind of sad to think of this as the new generation of adults. I hope I'm wrong.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jun 19, 2022~The vanilla sweet cream cold brew needed more cream at this location. Short line on an early midday Sunday afternoon.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Dec 28, 2022~The staff here is great and the location is really nice! I come almost every day. However, I'd say about 70% of the time they're out of at least one thing we're trying to order. The breakfast sandwiches, lemon loafs, peppermint syrup, stoppers, sleeves, etc. We're un-phased by it now so we come with back up plans for our coffee/breakfast order. Not a great stop if you're particular about your coffee routine
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 3, 2022~This Starbucks USED TO BE a very good location. I don't know hat has happened. But now drinks are constantly messed up. And by the worst on 03/31/2022 again. Drink messed up. Easy to make. Not horribly complicated. But just to add extra shots of espresso into a drink seems like a BIG DEAL and a hassle for closers. Which I don't understand why. I took one sip.  Couldn't taste the added triple shot. Barista Annie did offer to remake.  But it took  her 10 MINUTES all because she was talking crap so much about the drink so loudly. I can hear it from the booth right by the entrance door while she's there behind the barista bar. Unprofessional. Very unhappy. No one seems to give a crap about keeping customers. Cuz the other worker she was talking to was in the lobby gossiping back to her. I work for Dunkin' in Scottsdale and our store has way more professionalism than this! If you feel the need to go gossip and talk crap. Do it on your phone with a text or do it behind in the kitchen where no one can hear you instead absolutely unacceptable and will not tolerate being treated like such shit just from a location that's convenient to home.   And please quit randomly closing early. We're understaffed too but we still stay open FULL HOURS drive thru, lobby and all
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 24, 2022~I went to this Starbucks this morning in the drive thru. I ordered a black cold brew which was bitter as hell. Tried the back sausage wrap and it was cold in the middle. My wife did like her Chai latte and sandwich.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 11, 2023~My mom and I were at starbucks this morning and the emplo Bea was super sweet!!! He was very respectful and nice. Wonderful person!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 5, 2021~Best Starbucks in the state! Coffee is always made right and every staff member is delightful, helpful, friendly, and kind! Way to go this particular Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 17, 2022~It's staring to become inconsistent again and it's getting old to tell you the truth. I love Starbucks and being able to enjoy a cup of coffee especially when it's walking distance from me. However it's getting to the point where staff has said `"we are out of the strawberries for the açaí refresher.`" Which I was ok with not getting. What did I get instead, a hibiscus tea that clearly had no strawberry syrup I wish there was more transparency but this location is constantly out of so many things but when you drive down the road to another Starbucks location they seem to never be out of anything. It's just getting a bit frustrating.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 13, 2019~Thought I would mention this location is improving. The drinks are better to taste now and the drive thru line doesn't take a long time to get through. Keep up the great work. Update 6-13-19 Wow are the drinks amazing now. They are made just perfect! Awesome improvement here. Can't wait to keep coming by and it's walking distance from my place no more driving to the other locations ! Yay !!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 27, 2018~Thought I would mention this location is improving. The drinks are better to taste now and the drive thru line doesn't take a long time to get through. Keep up the great work!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Nov 4, 2018~The drinks are not made like they normally are at other Starbucks location. I feel like the staff really needs to be trained on their drink making. The drive thru line always takes a long time. You need a good 15 solid minutes before you even leave the line. I hope this improves although it's such a convenient location I have been driving further out to another location because the quality of the drink taste a lot better.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 27, 2018~I am so happy this opened right where I live now I don't have to travel as far to get coffee and it's across the street from Paradise Valley Community College ! How convenient !!! The staff here is well trained and really knows how to operate. The service is quick and speedy. My coffee is made just like it always is. Not every location gets it right but I'm happy they do. This is going to be my new starbucks location I come to.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 14, 2022~Not impressed, just curious how much does Starbucks charge for a refill on a standard cup of coffee grande?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 31, 2023~Service has improved dramatically! Now, enthusiastic and friendly staff delivering quality products.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 20, 2022~Yesterday (Oct. 19 @5pm) was the first time I received great customer service from this location. Amazing employees they were so nice! The girl cashier inside kept a smile and was happy to take our order. I wanted to get their names so they can get recognition but they were quick on getting other orders out so I didn't want to distract them. I know that the girl had long pretty lashes and two other guys. Thank you, I really appreciate you guys!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 12, 2019~New Starbucks! Yes! Plus this location is on the corner and has a drive thru! Bonus points!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 8, 2022~Horrible. Never coming here again! Every time time I come to this Starbucks they never mix my coffee and only add a splash of creamer as well as overfill the cup. I always have to come back so I can get more creamer and a straw to mix my coffee. No matter what I get. The frappes are tasteless and bland. It's unbelievable. This Coffee tastes nasty btw.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Nov 26, 2018~Nice new location right across the street from PVCC! Spacious seating area, but could use more tables with charging ports vs the cute seating arrangements they have now since it's being used by quite a bit of students and others with PCs and tablets, working. Love the decor though,  the service was friendly and fast, and both my tea and coffee were done just right
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 19, 2022~The baristas here are pleasant and efficient. It's a hard job and I appreciate them. Order here at least twice a week and the experience has been consistently great. Thanks!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 23, 2023~This Starbucks &amp; employees are wonderful. I came in today while having a pretty bad day. The barista told me they were out of the sandwich I wanted (not their fault), and I just started crying in front of her. She was so sweet and even gave me a hug. I was so embarrassed because I was just having a bad day, but she was so kind to me about it and I really appreciated it. 10/10
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 15, 2019~Stopped by this Starbucks to give it a try. The Pikes Coffee is the same as every where else. Newer store and larger than my usual hang out. This location has a couple of spots that have living room seating.  Service was good. Car wash located next door but not really a nuisance if sitting outside. No shade for those sunny afternoons and did not see a bike rack. Nice place to try out.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 11, 2020~This location is the worst! Sadly! I'm a Starbucks addict and this place can't get it together!!! I go to this location because it is the only one closest to my house. Every time I go they get my drink wrong. Today I spent $25 in Starbucks purchases and wasn't even offered a free Starbucks air freshener!!! I seriously hope this location can get its act together it is so maddening!! If you can avoid this location and go to another Starbucks I would highly recommend it! Sincerely, The biggest Karen of them all (don't care)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 1, 2019~Puppy Love! Come feel the love. This place is perfect every time. You can choose inside, outside or drive-thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 13, 2022~My daughter and I love this Starbucks. It's our neighborhood store. The staff is always friendly. Also, shoutout to Nanette who always makes us feel welcome. She is a joy to talk to. Enjoy! :))
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 18, 2019~I have been coming here for over a year now and I can honestly say that I haven't had a bad experience yet! (And trust me, I come here A LOT) I often use their mobile order pickup service and they have never taken more than 4-5 min from me ordering. I finally decided to write a review because I want to acknowledge how great management is. I come for the teas and occasional holiday drinks. During this time SO MANY people order the medicine ball (definitely recommend btw for tea lovers), but this means that they are consistently out of Jade Citrus Mint Tea by 1 PM. When I asked for a Jade Citrus Mint Tea today, they were out of course at 4 PM, and the manager could tell I was bummed but not totally upset. She suggested one of her favorite combinations and even offered it on the house since they're always out of the JCMT! Also super awesome of them: I have a holiday reusable cup and she was so great to put a sleeve because for those who have them can vouch for me when I say are thin and too hot to hold without one! I've been to all 5 other starbucks that are within a mile radius of this one and I always come to this one. Has the most seating compared to the others, too (except for Tatum and Bell, I think their the same).
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 13, 2019~Best Starbucks I've been to by far when it comes to customer service. Staff is extra friendly here and I've been here maybe 3-4 times and they've memorized my order! How cool! Not as much tables here as others I've been to (which is what I need for school work) but plenty of chairs for relaxed mingling or reading. I've witnessed them handle some tough customers before and they always handle it so well.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 18, 2019~This is right around the corner from the abode so it's beyond convenient. I like that's it's a larger store; good place to study, socialize etc. We've been here several time already and the staff is very prompt, friendly and all you expect from Starbucks.Only drawback it had a tiny parking lot and it will be eventually shared with another store so that might make things interesting. It does have a drive thru as well.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Mar 24, 2023~drinks are fine, but i get like 2 sips of it. calm down with ice jesus christ.  make the drinks how you would want it yourself, it's not hard
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 18, 2020~Absolutely terrible service. I've been to this location 3 times, all for drive through. They messed up my order 2 times. First time I ordered the iced guava passion fruit iced drink with light ice. The drink they gave me almost had a cup full of ice in it. When I pointed this out they removed the ice, refilled some juice, and added some syrup. The drink basically ended up being gross and undrinkable. The second time was earlier this morning when I ordered a decaf pike and iced black tea lemonade. They gave me a machicato and black iced tea. I again pointed this out and they did give me a decaf plwhich I asked for but for the iced black tea lemonade they simply gave me a cup with only lemonade in it, did you expect me to mix the drink myself?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 24, 2020~The young kids holding down the fort here are doing their best. However, I think the drive thru only environment is getting to them. I ordered the same drink I usually order and their response was `"ok but it usually comes hot so it'll take us longer to make it iced.`" And I was confused so I said `"what?`" And they were like `"It's just going to take longer to make.`" Maybe it's just me, but it really felt like they didn't want to make my really simple iced tea drink. So I, in shock, said `"ok, thats all. Thank you`" and pulled forward. When I got to the window I immediately apologized and explained that I didn't know what to say because of course iced tea takes longer than hot tea... They didn't say `"oh its ok`" or `"no problem.`" Nope.  They proceeded to tell me they can't make the drink in a Trenta. Even though I always get it that way. Just... bizarre. They ended up giving me my stuff for free even though I insisted I wanted to pay. *sigh* Honestly, I think these kids just need some time at the beach or at the park with friends or something. I only felt compelled to write this as a way to process my absolute shock (I still felt like they just did NOT want to make my drink), and because if you are looking for a high level of service right now - this just ain't it, sis. With fewer options for starbucks right now, I'm going to give this Starbucks a break and go out of my way. I hope it gets better once we can all go in the store again.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 7, 2022~Very rude management I ordered an iced coffee there was I waited for 20 mins the people behind me got there order I ask about mine and she snapped I got my money back and the tip a went to black rock.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Oct 21, 2019~Came here at 8 PM there was nobody in the drive thru and it took them 9 minutes to get my order and give me my drink add on an extra 3 minutes because the guy couldn't understand me after repeating myself saying `"reload my starbucks card first and then charge my drink on my starbucks card..`" he charged my debit card with the drink and reload which would make me miss out on my points. I made him redo the whole transaction which was a waste of time. On the bright side when I said extra salted sweet cream cold foam they did put it unlike some other locations that barely put any extra. The drink didn't taste like it had 8 pumps of caramel syrup like I had asked, being an ex starbucks employee I can tell if a drink is made right or not.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Nov 29, 2019~It's a nice location with friendly staff but the internet upload speeds are among the slowest I've ever found in a Starbucks. If you are looking for a great drink, come here. If you are looking for a great drink while uploading a Youtube Video...go somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Sep 7, 2019~This location is convient for me and Ive never had an issue which is why they get 3 stars. Now I understand there needs to be room for foam but if Im paying $6 for a coffee and before I even take a sip its like an inch or two down from the rim thats just super dissapointing. I feel like I just wasted my money since half the coffee I paid for isnt even in the cup.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 26, 2020~Was 10 cars deep in the drive-through to get my unsweetened green tea only to get home and discovered it had seven pumps of sugar in it and tasted nasty. There was probably another dozen cars behind me in line so not going through that again to get it fixed so just dumped 3.50 down the drain! My bad I didnt check before pulling out but didnt want to delay the line. How hard is unsweetened green tea?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 1, 2020~I come here all the time for a cold brew and bacon sandwich and it never disappoints! Easily the best Starbucks in the Northern Phoenix/Cave Creek Area! Stay safe everyone
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 6, 2019~I watched your barista make my frapp using a dirty blender.  My frapp tasted like milk! If youre going to charge someone $5.70 for coffee, make sure it has coffee!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 2, 2021~This is my go-to location on my way to work! The service is always fast and the employees are always nice, Miguel is awesome and provides superb customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 14, 2018~I have no idea what the other 2 reviews are complaining about..I have been here everyday since they opened and sometimes twice a day...Great Staff , Great Service and I must say an Awesome Atmosphere...Tammy the MGR is a wonderful person along with her outstanding staff , Greg, Kyle, Erica, Sam, Bethany, Shanika. A very friendly, welcoming place. If you are particular on the way you want your drink made, you will not get an attitude here.They will make it exactly the way you want it!! Keep up the Great work...Thanks Michael
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 3, 2019~Drove through Starbucks to grab some coffee drinks for my son &amp; I &amp; to my delight they said they were on the house because of the hold up... I didn't notice that much of a wait but what a nice surprise...thanks guys !!!  See you soon...
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 29, 2019~The staff is always so cool and friendly, and the green tea frappes are the best!! Next I think I am going to try the snicker doodle!!! The guy made it sound Soo wonderful
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jan 1, 2019~Love this location. Easy to get in to and usually tables to sit and enjoy coffee. Friendly employees!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 8, 2020~Love this location! Always great products! The staff is so friendly and always kind. My kids love coming here and the staff make them feel valued!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 21, 2018~Come here early mornings before work.  The staff is amazing always super friendly.  And my drinks are always made perfect!   So glad this location was built because it's just down the street from me!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 6, 2021~The people are always very nice. They greet me by name every time, and immediately give me my order. Their greetings do not sound robotic or fake, they seem to genuinely love to serve their guests. I've only had a few very minor concerns, and each time I express them, they compensate me even if I'm just voicing my concern not looking for extras. Sometimes, I've even wrongly advised that the wrong drink was given to me, not realizing that the online order I selected was the wrong size, and they still give me the size I originally intended instead of what was ordered without arguing it.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 2, 2020~Nan in the drive thru window brightened my entire morning!! She was such a sweet genuine lady! I'll be back! Ps. My drink was perfect too! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jun 23, 2019~Ordered an americano in my personal mug. They asked if I wanted room. I said yes. Drink was delivered with coffee to the rim, no room. I asked them to dump some out. They did n it ran down my mug. They handed it back. I asked for a napkin to clean my mug. They complied. The drink wasn't  hot. Lack of quality.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 26, 2019~This location does not seem to represent the Starbucks model of providing customer care. I came into the store at 8:54pm; a few minutes before the store closed for the night. The manager gave me a frozen loaf of bread and was unable to heat it up. The manager kicked me out of the store and I was unable to get a refund. I will definitely never return to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 28, 2019~Great location. Very spacious store with updated tables with the USB chargers. They are one of the few in the area open until 9:30pm, which is great. Drinks and service are what you'd expect from the Starbucks brand.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Oct 14, 2019~To my surprise, they got my order right which is always a plus. The people were very rude, however, and, a pet peeve of mine, never tell me what my total is before I pay. This location has yet to tell me my total prior to paying and I've been coming here for two years just thinking `"maybe today is the day`" but it never is. It baffles me that some of these people still have a job.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~3~Dec 11, 2024~there are some nice baristas but also some very rude ones. most of the time they don't bother to make your drink correctly for whatever reason..
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Mar 4, 2024~The first thing I noticed when walking in on a Saturday afternoon was that the floors were quite dirty. I was the only one in the restaurant ordering at the time so I was confused why someone wasn't out cleaning tables and all the other mess. Starbucks stocks one of my favorite cold pressed brands called Evo. At this establishment, there was only two flavors; you can find better variety at other Starbucks. They did have Koia smoothie though which I haven't seen at other Starbucks. In addition to the protein smoothie, two Evo juices, I got a venti (that's their largest size) matcha creme frappacucino and a double bacon and egg sandwich. The breakfast sandwich cost more than an In N Out burger and was smaller than one too. The matcha frapp was delicious though. The whole order came out to $28.72.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Aug 29, 2024~Horrific service in their lobby. Waited for 25 minutes for 10 people to make a quad espresso.  When I went up and asked where it was, they said they put lobby customers drinks in a different place and it was sitting there the whole time.  As I'm standing where everyone is picking up their drinks the whole time.  Black Rock coffee is better anyway.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~4~Aug 14, 2024~I love this Starbucks, I like that it's close to my house and they have good seating. Sometimes the music is too loud and sometimes they randomly shut down the lobby which is annoying. Everyone here is really nice.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Oct 1, 2024~There's one employee at this location who is always rude. I frequent many Starbucks locations, but will never visit this one again.  Drive farther to one without this rude employee. I'm accustomed to good customer service at Starbucks, but because of one employee, this location fails.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Sep 16, 2023~I will never go back to this Starbucks until they get better management. The manager is so arrogant and rude literally over any simple modifications to a drink. For example. I ordered a Venti iced chai with oat milk and pumpkin sauce in a Trenta cup. She literally flipped out on me. Told me that's not part of their standards at Starbucks and they're not allowed to do that. How that goes against their policies. I said to her. Charge me for a cup.  Or charge me for extra oat milk. I said to her. I've never ever ran into this problem at any Starbucks stand alone or even ones in the grocery store and started naming off all the other locations that I've been to that have done it for me. She proceeded to argue me that I had to pay for venti and etc. I asked for Trenta ice cup on side. She told me I was harassing her. I said to her. I'm a paying customer and how am I harassing her when she's the one starting shit with me. I said to her. Maybe some professionalism would help her out some. I said to her. No customer should have to experience this especially over something like a venti drink in a Trenta.  So to top it all off. I'm waiting for my drink for almost 10 minutes. I asked about it. She said she cancelled it. Like wtf??
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Jan 31, 2024~Stepping into this coffee haven feels like a warm embrace for your senses. From the rich aromas to the expertly crafted brews, every cup tells a story of passion and dedication. A must-visit for anyone seeking a truly elevated coffee experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Nov 19, 2023~Wanted to get the holiday red cup they had and asked if they they had anything sugar free so I could get the cup, I can't have any sugar and I explained that to them so what could they make for me, the girl said nothing! So then she ask the manager and the manager said can't make anything, So I ask can I any other drink to get the red cup and they said No goodbye, so I went to Dutch Brothers  and enjoyed the way treat customers
Phoenix, AZ 85020~3~Mar 7, 2021~SB on a slightly sketchy street. I had a psycho walking by threaten me and several strung out acting people were wandering around. I had to call security from the shopping center who did a good job deterring the wannabe robber.The SB is smaller than avg with small seating area. They lose a star for not allowing customers to sit down even outside which other Starbucks are allowing.Below avg. Starbucks, not recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Feb 7, 2023~Love this location &amp; others. The staff is great,Bryce one of the mgrs,Keiko,Andy and everyone are awesome.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Dec 8, 2022~My favorite Starbucks &amp; staff. They do great drinks.they go out of their way for me &amp; treat me great
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~May 29, 2022~This is one of my favorite Starbucks in Sunnyslope,close to my favorite Honor Health formerly (John C Lincoln hospital) close to all medical. You will see medical staff in this Starbucks,they are great
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Jun 13, 2023~I just want to give a BIG and SINCERE shout out to this Starbucks. They were very fast, efficient, friendly, and most importantly....accurate. I've been a loyal customer for years now. I've been to Starbucks all across the country and this the best tasting Strawberry Acai that I've ever tasted. Thank you Adam (the barrister) and the beautiful young lady (Miss Ponytail) who took my order. Whenever I'm nearby, I'll be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Mar 6, 2024~Dunlap and 1st st store-  12:15 on 3/5/24: both coffees were missing requested cream, food was mediocre and not worth the inflated prices. Drive-thru Batista was not friendly. Today, I decided to go to a different Starbucks in future if at all.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Aug 28, 2023~5 star is for Michelle. She is literally the absolute best Starbucks employee I have ever had any interaction with. She is so SWEET!! Anytime I ever go in it's PACKED, especially when school is in session. You got teachers, you got students, then you got your usual AM crowd. She literally remains polite, calm &amp; as fast as she can go. I always know my drink is good when she works. If there ever was a mess up she's never made me feel like I'm bothering her which in the past at the location this has happened if I asked for a remake /: but not with her. Another thing that I want to mention is both her and Stephanie always say MY NAME as soon as I walk in. Hello Serena!!! Like HEYYYY. They actual care about my name. Keep up the great work. Best Starbucks &amp; Barista of the year !!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Jan 9, 2024~Such nice workers! I loved Jeremy, he personally made my night and went out of his way to be so kind to me. I had been working on homework for an hourish and he had offered me water as well. Overall, great staff experience and very clean store.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Jun 1, 2022~One of the worst Starbucks locations I have ever visited! They are unable to make drinks on their menu, and somehow they have figured out how to rush you on the speaker...but keep you waiting in line forever.One particular visit here, I ordered a drink and as usual they messed it up...it was the most watered down frappe I have ever seen. Anyhow I called in to advise the manager, and she stated I could return later to have it remade. I returned, and when they remade the drink, they had me park out front until they brought it. They brought my drink, and they put the top in loose so it could fall all over my clothes. This drink was also very watered down. That was last time I would ever visit this location.If anyone cares to read this, these people are evil! They're rude, and they talk to customers however they wish. I don't believe they are reprimanded or trained. Instead of stopping at this location (which is 5 minutes away from my home) I drive up to Greenway rd near 7th street. It's worth the drive, to meet nice folks. I truly would love to see this location shut down for good. There is nothing but bad energy and drinks here.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Dec 4, 2023~I would like to say they are the most disrespectful and condescending people I have ever met!  I went inside and ordered my drinks and asked to use the restroom.  Which after a long talk with the guy about my change, I was already pissed off at him.  Then he said I would have to leave my purse at the front counter!!  I'm a 43 year old woman and I don't need to leave my purse anywhere!!  Needless to say I just got my drinks and left...went to Walmart and used their restroom.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Jun 21, 2019~Now Open Starbucks across from the Hospital- I'm sure I'm not the only one who is tired, thirsty or mentally drained when dealing with the worry of family health concerns right!? Well Starbucks is now open across the street from John C Lincoln Hospital and I'm sure this was long overdue for the early mornings and late nights. The staff was extra friendly, the location was convenient, and the staff was cleaning while I was here.Extra shout out to the staff member who showed me sneak peak to Starbucks Tumblers that are coming out next week so I can get excited to use my Starbucks rewards points! Following you on Instagram already!My experience was perfect!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Aug 19, 2023~Poor service. Went on Saturday 8/19 about 2:45 PM; it was not a busy time as only one car was ahead of us in the drive thru. I ordered a venti pineapple passion fruit lemonade (the frozen drink featured on their menu). It came back iced but not blended. Then, when we asked for it to be made frozen again like on the menu, the girl was annoyed and we were told we ordered it wrong. When the barista remade it, she just put it back in the blender with a bit of ice.  I ended up with a watery `"frozen`" lemonade. I go to other locations in the valley regularly and they've always made this drink well. I ended up going to the Starbucks on W Northern Ave to order it again -- they apologized and even offered to comp the drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Feb 23, 2023~Check your drinks if you are using the drive through, half the time they aren't correct. I always order the same drink - a grande quad cappuccino - and I receive that order correctly maybe half the time. Paying $6+ dollars for a drink, it should be right! Unfortunately I don't have time to travel to a different location so I try not to come very often, so anyone else who visits this location just double check your order.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Jul 24, 2021~Too bad.Since my last review this Starbucks staff and service has gone downhill. The decline was slow and steady but I stuck with it for a while. All culminated with an exaggerated eye roll when I asked for a receipt. Pathetic behavior for any service job to be honest.Big shout out to the old crew here. The management and employees did a great job back then.I won't be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~May 21, 2020~Way better than the average Starbucks. This is by far the best Starbucks I have ever been to. I have been going here for almost 3 years and they absolutely kill it. Wait times are short, almost all staff if friendly, they remember your drinks after a while, and coffee tastes great. Shout out to the employees and especially the managers. Top down effect is working great and a little culture has brewed.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Apr 23, 2022~I always go to this Starbucks however I am so frustrated with the management how how they are handling problems. While going through the drive through around two weeks ago I was never handed my card back. I canceled the card just in case and received a new card two weeks later. The day after getting my new card I go the same Starbucks and the SAME thing happens. I go to run errands and don't have my card again. I know I should be double checking to make sure I have my card but for them to also forget to give it back and say I am go to go is frustrating. When I went to get my second card back I mentioned that this is the second time that this has happened and I got a response `"okay and what do you want us to do about it`". I understand they are busy and are used to scanning phones but still I felt like they could care less.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Nov 30, 2022~Every time I order a drink in the afternoon/evening the staff are super rude or oblivious to guests. Yesterday I had a barista upset because I asked for a straw  lol Morning staff are a bit better- at least they smile and say hi instead of glaring at you or flat out ignoring you lol
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Jun 21, 2022~This place delivers the worst customer service of any Starbucks I have ever visited.  If there is a home of daemons and evil, this geographic location is it.Management cannot hold onto a stable set of workers, and the employees are MEAN, SLOW, and deliver terrible service.  I truly think if there is hub of evil in Sunnyslope, it's at this Starbuck's location - because every time I go there, bad stuff is happening.  The other day, 3 cops were called there.  And as a customer, I can tell you that the employees do nothing to appease the customers as they have been extremely rude and passive-aggressive to me - and I ain't no Karen.  I just go with the flow, get my coffee, and if they're mean, I just ignore them and drive away.   Even watching cars ahead of me, I have seen customers (who just want their coffee!) get upset with jerkweed employees.I told one of the managers (who has always been outstanding to interact with, forgot her name), and she acknowledged that it was a total S**T show working there.  To potential customers, go to another branch as this branch is full of mean girls, jerks, and negative energy, and they will ruin your day.To the employees, stop taking our your mental aggressions/disease on the innocent customers.  Most customers just want their coffee - there is NO reason to be rude and passive aggressive with the good ones.  I understand there are bad customers, but just because they are mean to you doesn't give you the right to take it out on the next person in line!  If you can't handle working in customer service, then quit and do something else.    You shoot yourself in the foot and just pay forward negative energy.  I hope Starbucks corporate closes this location - it's evil incarnate.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Jun 5, 2021~I come to buy every day and the lobby it's close every day before 11 AM it's a problem Because it's always a big line on the drive-through I think this is a problem please fix
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Sep 23, 2020~Staff super nice. Someone usually says welcome to Starbucks. Drive Thru very busy. Clean store. Ppl sitting inside do take off their masks. Not ok.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~3~Jul 14, 2021~Felt compelled to write an update after several recent visits (it's close to my doctor's office) and their customer service has improved. No, I do not challenge them with complex orders but if I keep it simple, it's usually A-OK. The mid-pandemic pick-up would change every time I returned, sometimes the front door would be open, sometimes you could only access the side doors, but there was always signage to reflect the change.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Oct 1, 2019~You may want to avoid this location altogether. At the drive thru window, I've been told to wait in the parking lot for nitro cold brews that never materialized (I called the store and reminded them they sent me there 15 minutes prior and they literally had no idea what I was talking about BECAUSE, WAIT, WHAT STARBUCKS HAS EVER DONE THAT, IT ISN'T A MCDONALDS); today I placed an in-app order where the male barista not only gets my order completely wrong (green tea instead of black) but then HIDES the drink behind the otherwise empty pick-up stand while I wait patiently for my name to be called. Who does that? It's been way too long for them to get a `"it's a new store`" pass, this is habitual and a reflection of poor managerial oversight. The Sunnyslope Starbucks motto should be `"baristas who have absolutely no training, blank stares and a genuine hatred for humanity`".
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Apr 25, 2021~THIS IS THE SECOND TIME! It's 7:45pm and this location is closed. The hours online reflect a 9pm closing time. So annoying to pull up and see cones in the drive thru!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Oct 7, 2019~So everyone was nice. They apologized that it took longer than it should have for my drink. I'm a at least a once a day girl. Was in the neighborhood and need a coffee. Mobile ordered while I was at the light at 7th St. Pull in and walk inside. Hadn't even started my drink. Male barista asks my name. He says I'm working on it. He pours my cold brew and adds the cream then proceeds to ask a female to finish for him. Again she was nice BUT she proceeds to put ice in my drink and put a lid on it and hand it to me. I'm like this was supposed to have cold foam...it was? Did you read the label? Trenta Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, extra ice. So male turns and says `"did you want extra foam?`" No. I wanted extra ice. Female dumps part of my drink out and gives me what little cold foam that is left in the blender. We are out of pumpkin cold foam now. Oy vey. Please just read the label when you make my drink. It's in black and white. It really irks me when I pay $6 for a coffee and it's not perfect. Two stars. One for each of the baristas. They were nice but nice doesn't always cut it.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~May 31, 2022~This is my favourite Starbucks.  They make my drinks best and I never have to wait very long.  The drive-through  layout here can be a bit of a cluster because of the parking lot for the strip mall  but their drive through lines are shorter than most others and the employees are always friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Nov 17, 2022~Mixed feelings about this Starbucks; I normally come In the morning and have fantastic service; but when I come after 12 noon seems like everyone is in a bad mood and dread work which make my experience unpleasant; they will also let you stand in line  for a long time till you actually have to ask for assistance.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~3~Feb 9, 2019~Been here a few times. Not bad. Today we were disappointed in the dollop of whip cream on our drinks. We asked for more when the girl at the window turned around to tell the other barista our request, the look on her face wasn't happy. FYI..be mindful of your facial expressions when customers are watching. After paying over $13 for 2 drinks I don't think it should be a crime to ask for the whip cream serving that should come on top. So she returned with the drinks and they added another shot of it on one side of the dome of the cup. Guess asking for it to be topped off correctly wasn't what they wanted to do. Disappointing especially when this is a new Starbucks and you are so close. I'm ok with driving to Dutch Bros and getting what I ask for with a pleasant response too, oh and it's cheaper!! Do better Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Aug 17, 2019~Brendan took my order and was perfect! Dude had good vibes and made my drink phenomenal! Extremely happy and just when I needed getting off work!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Sep 17, 2022~Never in my life, have I come across a drive-through experience in which I was so thoroughly changed. 15 minutes before the close of my green and white mermaid lover, Two friends and I embarked on a journey to spend a collection of tattered birthday gift cards. For years, money has been piling up in the bottom of my sock drawer in the form of $5 gift cards. Whether a generous thank-you gift or a stingy birthday present, I've acquired at least 5 plastic seasonal masterpieces every year. After 13 years of saving, I finally had enough to treat my friends and me to a cup of whatever they wanted, and nothing sounded better than a well-made cup of chocolate milk. Upon driving to the Starbucks, the mood was high as our bodies twitched and scratched in anticipation of the sweet bump. 10 minutes till close, and we were pulling into the drive-through, our jaws now cramping as they clenched imaginary straws between them. With no line ahead of us, we proceeded directly to the talking box and rolled our window down, waiting for the mystery barista's voice. Up next came something we never could have expected. The silence was suddenly broken sirens song filled with a spew of poems, sonnets, limericks, haikus, and versets. My palms began to sweat and my body forgot to breathe as rhymes and rhythms were thrown at us each one hitting my ears so hard they seemed to push me deeper into my car seat. Only when our bodies quivered with the pleasure of such beauty did the words of wisdom finally cease. A moment of silence as the words passed from our memories leaving only a dopamine-drenched euphoric high. Then the cheer began, three stunning chocolate milk cravings, fools began to lift up a grateful noise unto the mystery Starbucks barista. Between our laying down of burnt offerings and cries of joy, somehow, our order was recorded and read back to us. Then words were spoken that redefined anticipation `"I'll see you at the pickup window`". My cramping calves and flexed toes would not accelerate to the pickup window for fear of being unworthy to meet the barista with the tongue of a god. Finally, after an intense session of Chong Ran to become the master of my body, I toed the gas pedal and made it to the window. Standing there, in all of his glory, was Eli. The barista of legend, the man who had changed everything with a minute of words. Pleasantries were exchanged, money was given for milk and we drove off. Silence hung heavy over our car as my companions and I pondered how different our lives would now look after being served in the most supreme fashion. The words spoken that night will never be repeated for the sole reason that their power was too epic to be welded by any one man. Any one man besides our Eli the great and powerful barista. Thank you for your service
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Aug 8, 2019~I love Starbucks.  I go at least once on most days.  There is one in South Phoenix that I frequent.  I stop at another on Roosevelt fairly frequently.  During summer and on weekends I stop at one on 7th and Osborne, or 7th st and McDowell... then there are near Bell and 7th street that I also frequent.  Now there is this new one, and it is so comparatively bad that I can't help but wonder why.I like the consistency from one to another.  I know that the items will be the same, whether I go to one Starbucks or another.  This is completely untrue for the Starbucks at 221 E Dunlap.  The first time I was there, they completely botched my order.  I tried to chalk it up to the store being new, and not running as well because it was new.  After a few weeks, I realized that my imagined problem had nothing to do with their ineptitude.  Every time I would order at that store, something would be incorrectly done or just weird. I would order whip and they would leave it off, I would leave the whip off, and they would add it.  I would get things that I did not order added to my beverage like cinnamon or colored sugars or drizzles that I did not ask for.  I started purchasing using my app so that they couldn't say that they didn't know I wanted this or that.  They would still make alterations in mu order that I did not request.  I would order an espresso frappuccino with sugarfree cinnamon syrup.  They would add the cinnamon, but leave out all the coffee.  Today I ordered a strawberry frappuccino which is normally made with whole milk.  Today, mine was made with nonfat milk. The barista also used a straw that was 3 inches shorter than my beverage.At most Starbucks, I count on about 3-5 minutes per car of wait time.  At 221 E Dunlap, I know the wait will be double or even triple.  There were cars behind me honking after 10 min.I also count on Starbucks to have a clean bathroom.  This is the only one in town that I have seen that still uses single-gender bathrooms.  This is also the only one that has offered no solution for customers when their ladies room is out of order. ​I have three university degrees and am 3 classes short of a Ph.D., yet their very young male employees still try to mansplain to me why the beverage with whip that I ordered is correct without the whip.  I think I'll stick with one [any] of the other Starbucks in my path.  I just don't know what else to say.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Mar 8, 2020~This is the worst Starbucks drive thru I've ever been to! I've literally been waiting over 15min for a venti drink.  Do not go to this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Mar 21, 2020~Starbucks!!? Why are your employees NOT wearing gloves? I was just passed a drink through the drive thru her hand was on the lid. Let's say I just wasted 7$ there's a virus out there! Glove up and don't touch where people's mouths go no matter what!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~May 23, 2019~Not a fan of this location. I was looking forward to a Starbucks in Sunnyslope but this new store  has left much to be desired. It feels like most times I come here the drinks are mediocre and the baristas aren't very friendly or they have very dry personalities. I do my best to just skip this specific location altogether.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Sep 11, 2022~The worst customer service, i ordered on my app arrived a few minutes after my pickup time. Due to today's current health issues with covid, I decided to go through the drive-through. When I got to the window a representative named Vivian asked how can i help you, i told her that i had a app order, she told me i would need to come in to pick up order. I told her i have waited in line already here in the drive-through, she once again told me I would need to come in side because it's policy, I asked again can she just hand me my drinks. She shut the window and just walked away, no cars behind me at the time. I could see her and other associate inside laughing and proceeded to make me wait at least five minutes before another male associate came and handed me my drinks in a bag while she stood right next to him. It was 10 minutes after the time my drinks were estimated to be ready that they were handed to me so I know I was not waiting because they needed to be made. I find this to be rude and really bad customer service. Why cause she just not hand me the bag? I already paid and waited in line. Also my drink which was the ice cold brew had no sweetener and very light milk, that is not what I ordered.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Mar 31, 2019~Every time I come here my drink is wrong, be it size or flavor. Ordered a grande got a tall. Just today I figured I'd give this location one last chance since it's just down the street.  I ordered a blended matcha and there were huge chunks of ice still inside, couldn't even drink it. I think the employees here need some more training.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Jul 19, 2019~Second time to this location, as it is one of few coffee options close to the hospital. Was reluctantly greeted just as I was the first time. Very slow and I was the only one in line and the only person waiting for a drink, after waiting about 10 minutes I overheard the baristas in the back laughing that they forgot to make mine, a few minutes later I was called. No apology, no empathy, heck not even eye contact! no nothing!!!. Will now go out of my way to avoid this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~May 19, 2021~Yes, this shop is in a diverse neighborhood. We like coffee too. It is very clean and the service is pleasant and consistent. They always get my order right. I have noticed the employees are kind to the neighborhood people without letting them overrun the place. The music is lively and the employees seem to be having a good time, promoting an overall nice vibe when I walk in to pick up my coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Aug 11, 2019~Coffee always tastes burnt.  I honestly think they over-roast their beans.  Also heard recently that pesticides have been found in their coffee.  Going back to Grinders.  Not sure why I left in the first place.  Drivethrough, maybe?
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Jan 18, 2021~I ordered 3 drinks, none of them were filled (only about 1/2 way full, and my latte was literally just milk, yea just milk no actual coffee. i went January 17th to the Bethany and 7th Ave location at about 7pm. very sad
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Feb 10, 2019~https://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/starbucks-doubleshot-on-ice For next time...
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Mar 23, 2019~Finally a Starbucks in Sunnyslope. I like it because it is on the edge of the Walmart shopping center but not really in it. It is set back in its own little  area. I like this Starbucks better than the one at Missouri and 7th St. It is very clean and has these really beautiful large windows that give it a very light-filled and airy setting. The girls who  waited on us were super nice. I am looking forward to making this a favorite place. Will definitely be back to check out the breakfast sandwiches.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Oct 13, 2019~The drinks/food always taste good &amp; the drive thru line always seems long but it goes quick which is nice considering I'm typically going on my way to work.. but I'm really tired of asking for my stars to be applied to my order and it not happening!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Oct 11, 2019~Arrived at 7:45pm - all chairs were inside - we wanted to sit outside-no deserts out - no decaf coffee - creamer not even out - I had to ask for it - very disappointing
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Apr 10, 2019~Finally ma guy, most convenient Starbucks for Sunnyslope high school I would only recommend this Starbucks if you in the Sunnyslope area by the way
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Apr 4, 2023~Again, absolutely amazing things to say about the workers. Jason has recently taken over as manager and I have seen him be extremely rude to customers as well as the workers who have been here long before he was. It seems very rude and the workers seem severely uncomfortable working with him and it is uncomfortable being a customer with him there yelling at them...
Glendale, AZ 85304~4~May 3, 2018~Nice place for small working meetings or a place to camp out to get coffee, tea and get some work done. Several of my colleagues and I met at this Starbucks to get ready for a presentation. It was nice to see other people working on their laptops and make use of their strong Wi-Fi.I enjoyed my Citrus and Peach Green Tea Venti with light ice. It was refreshing and carried me through my meeting.The staff at this Starbucks was quick and friendly. I will be back.
Glendale, AZ 85304~4~May 31, 2019~Just  in for a quick drink because I was around the corner, the 2 barristers are very friendly and nice and greeted me very friendly. Service was fast and the place looked a very clean. Would be come back again.
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Feb 9, 2017~I hate to give 1 star but specifically stopped at Albertsons just for a coffee. 8:20 on a beautiful Wednesday morning to find it closed. I sat a while thinking the barista had to use the restroom. No note, nothing. Waited a few minutes. Left. Went to McDonalds.
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Jul 14, 2017~There is one specific barista that works there that is very rude. She has no customer service, she always says she's closed in the middle of the day; however, there is no type of sign showing there will be any type of inconvenience to customers. She refuses to make certain orders, she's always rolling her eyes and grunting at customers, not to mention she's always slamming around things while she makes orders. Can someone please remove this lady before she has some type of breakdown on a customer. I'm surprised if it hasn't happened yet. I don't even need to add a name I think a lot of people reading this review will know who I am mentioning.
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Jan 20, 2017~Apparently you can just leave the counter for 20 minutes as long as your leave a `"went to restroom`" paper slapped to the counter. After the guest services employee saw me waiting, she paged `"lex`" who was not quite happy she was pulled away from whatever she was doing. She didn't greet me with a hello or even a smile. Asked what I needed, slapped it on the counter and walked away. She was super pleasant!! Don't seek a barista job if you obviously hate being nice.
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Jul 8, 2017~Unacceptable when an employee gets upset because the drink is wrong and you ask for them to fix it, they are so upset that they go on a rant about how horrible their life is. The manager step in an fix the drink, that still doesn't make up for the experience. Will not be returning to this location.
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Jun 1, 2016~Starbucks is really overrated, REALLY! I can't stress enough how different the coffee is every time you go in there. One day it's burnt, the next day it's bitter. There's so many other better joints, mom and pops, small businesses, better tasting coffee, friendlier environments than this place!!! No I'm not an ex-employee, I just know good coffee when I taste it!
Glendale, AZ 85304~5~Nov 28, 2015~Thank you! Staff was friendly, coffee was hot, Batista helped us cali girls find a mug we needed...
Glendale, AZ 85304~5~Dec 1, 2014~I'm usually hesitant to go to a Starbucks located in a grocery store simply because their quality of customer service is lacking BUT today the gentlemen who helped me was amazing! Great service and amazing coffee:) can't complain!
Glendale, AZ 85304~5~Jun 28, 2014~I love this starbucks drinks are so good every time I go in especially when Julie makes them and all the employees are so friendly and amazing will continue to come here every morning before wk ....
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Aug 30, 2017~I hate to do it but I have to give the Starbucks location one star. I should've reviewed this one along time ago but didn't want to base my review off of one experience. First I feel like this location is a knock off Starbucks. They are frequently out of ingredients &amp; the staff leaves you up front while they have to go `"to the back`" to re-up whatever it is they need to make your drink. When this happens on three separate occasions the employee has looked irritated that they have to do that for you. Solution: stock up! As if this wasn't annoying enough-they often don't have certain ingredients at all to make specific drinks that are on the menu. Who does your purchasing?  Secondly, there is a barista there with short hair and glasses who is the epitome of rudeness. She gets short with you, has no warmth about her, and can often be found in the morning talking to the same lady for an extended period of time while you wait for her to take your order by the register. My main complaint about her is truly her rudeness. She has no business interfacing with customers. The last thing that I will say is that I have often gotten my drinks made wrong at this location-this morning alone my initial drink was made incorrectly. And let me give a disclaimer that I'm not one of those crazy Java heads that orders not so off the menu items. I always order standard Starbucks menu items. So then then my second drink was made incorrectly this morning but I didn't have the heart to have this person to make it a third time. I was already now running late against my schedule. When I'm paying over five dollars for a drink while mistakes happen double mistakes are ridiculous. I will no longer go to this location-it needs either better management or to get with the program. Until then, I will always consider this location the red headed step child of the Starbucks corporation-a total sub par knock off.
Glendale, AZ 85304~5~Aug 20, 2015~Love this place!! Have been going here for several years and I never get a bad drink..no matter what I order. The staff is always amazing..super friendly...know me by name..and even customize drinks for me. I go here at least 6 times a week!!
Glendale, AZ 85304~5~Sep 20, 2015~When I go to regular Starbucks stores (not the ones in grocery stores), the drinks I get tend to really differ in taste even though I always get the same thing. It's like a gamble whether or not I'll get a good drink and considering how expensive it is, no one wants to take that gamble! But every time I go to the Starbucks in the Albertsons on 51st &amp; Cactus, my drinks are absolutely delicious every time! There's never much of a wait and it's cheaper than the regular stores because of the different tax rate for grocery stores! All of these things mean I drive out of my way just to get my Starbucks at this location. The employees are really friendly too.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Dec 18, 2023~This Starbucks needs to pay attention to all there promotions that are going on when working with Target. I went in today trying to use bogo free promo with the target app they said that it wasn't valid until Thursday 21st but the promo on the Target app states that it expired on the 20th which is a Wednesday.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 6, 2023~Asked for light ice, they forgot and when I asked them to fix it they just added water and shook it until half the drink was foam. There's another starbucks nearby, much better service there.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Aug 12, 2019~I now go out of my way to use this Starbucks. Michael is the best. Most of the staff have made it a point to know me. My drink is always made correctly and my son's favorite birthday cake cake pop is always fresh. I still hate that I can't mobile order but I will make the sacrifice to have my drink correct!
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Mar 21, 2019~I love this Starbucks. Ken was always my go to but he now works within the Target store. Isaiah now is usually working and he is great too. He always remembers what I order and makes my drink to my satisfaction which isn't always the case with stand alone locations. When paying over $5 for a coffee I expect it to be perfect. There is also another gentleman thats works the afternoons and he is great too. I just wish I could mobile order to save time.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jul 20, 2022~This is my favorite Starbucks ever. I have a special drink, venti brewed chai, and it feels so good that the crew knows my order. I feel so loved. That are always so kind and I never have any issues. Even when they are busy they remain so wonderful, polite and professional. This is my little Starbucks family and service like this really kicks off my day with such a positive note. Y'all are the best!!!!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 16, 2022~Do not come here between 2-4 pm the worker at the register SUPER rude attitude unnecessary it's best to come when she's not working, she seems to be more busy with giving a target working free samples then doing her job or your better off going through a drive through on your way home at least they are nicer, &amp; cheerful she was just awful maybe because the guy blew her off and didn't even bother with her samples poor girl, sad. love Starbucks tho
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Apr 10, 2021~I love stopping at this Starbucks when I have to shop at Target. They always get my order right and they are quick. A must have when shopping.
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Mar 3, 2020~So today while I out shopping, and since they had a @starbucks inside the store. I'm not a coffee drinker so I rarely go into a coffee place. I got a sugar cookie and a chocolate croissant which was very flakey and chocolatey. The staff was very friendly and speedy. The location was very clean and upkeeped very well. So out of ratings for 1-10 I give the staff an 8, the cookie a 7, and the chocolate croissant a 7 my only comment will be if you are going to eat the chocolate croissant right away have them warm it up first.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 7, 2019~I wish I can give them a zero but to bad it does not exist. Bathrooms are filthy dirty, Costumer service suck. I went and order strawberry Frappuccino and sat down and after 10 minutes I was called to be advised that they don't have strawberry syrup. So I had my money refunded. I also bought my little niece a birthday cake pop next thing you know the poor thing went home and had diarrhea after eating their cake pop.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~5~May 22, 2024~Of course a Starbucks is built here after I move from the neighborhood nearby  My fam moved down the road so this Starbucks is on the way and I've stopped a few times, no issues. The line is pretty quick. I usually mobile order because it's easier. I always get shaken espressos or iced coffee and they've been made right every time   I love that they have some merch outside of the drive thru window because there was a cup I was looking for and there it was. The barista quickly rang me up and I was on my way! Thanks Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85024~2~Jan 30, 2024~I recently went here to get a pistachio latte and some packaged almonds. Despite having five people working the counter and drive-thru, it took almost 10 minutes to get my latte. The drink itself was extremely disappointing-I could not taste the pistachio at all.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~5~Jul 7, 2024~Such nice people here. So kind and thoughtful. Quick, efficient and I don't want to write 85 characters.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~5~Jun 18, 2022~Awesome location! This one is always hopping because there just aren't many options for food and beverage around. They have one very large conference table in the dining room that is perfect for meetings.The employees are super enthusiastic and proactive. I loved that they had glasses of ice water to-go for guests! Both the drive-thru and dining room guests were taken care of.Cute, local decorations throughout which gave this location less of a corporate-feel which is refreshing.In a former life I, too, was a Starbucks Barista and can wholeheartedly recommend this one!
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Oct 8, 2023~It's a death trap in the morning with traffic coming in from two entrances, trying to merge into one drive through line. That, coupled with people pissed that you're blocking their cars in while you're stuck in the line that never freaking moves, makes this place more aggravation than it's worth. There are plenty of coffee places on the way to work that are faster, less irritating, safer, and have better service.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Dec 7, 2023~So I live right next to the Starbucks and for a while it was really good. But the drinks have started to suck and so does the food. I usually get the Banana bread or pumpkin bread. They never ask if you want it warmed up and today was my last straw. The banana bread was hardlike very hard and it tasted sour. I literally spit it out. Absolutely disgustingNot to mention the staff there doesn't really pay attention to their customers
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~May 18, 2024~Will never come back to this location. Not to mention they just going up in price and being stingy on refills while I'm in shop studying. I'm always able to get refills. Never again! Starbucks in general is probably going to be losing my business
Phoenix, AZ 85024~2~Oct 21, 2023~This location never gets the order right. I usually use the drive through and go. Every time I order a nitro cold brew, they give me some botched iced cold brew. Now I could go back and wait in the 15 car line up they have, but due to time constraints I just accept they messed up my order and I wasted $10 including tip, and I just move along. the kicker is Starbucks has implemented an `"tip`" option before paying. The staff is friendly, the location is clean. Just the service sucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Aug 6, 2021~Says on Google it was updated 2 days ago, saying it was open.Obviously it was not actually updated or anything because it is not open at all.There's no signage saying anything different either.Really disappointing to drive out here and try a new place, only to find it not accurately represented.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Mar 30, 2023~Half empty 8 dollar drink. Drink felt a bit light. Opened it up. Whip still there but drink still about 2/3rd full, same with second drink we got.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Feb 8, 2022~Never open You have to order through the application They won't allow anyone in the building but their friends
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Mar 4, 2023~I've gone to this location multiple times. Every single time I experience mean girls who act like they never grew out of high school. Just go the extra few miles and go to a different location, you'll probably be treated better. Last experience I had here, I was eating whipped cream in the lobby and the only other two people there (which were the workers) were looking at me and laughing. People here do NOT know how to respect other people! It's honestly a red flag that this business genuinely doesn't care about the bad reviews due to how the employees here treat customers. The people who own this establishment shouldn't even be in the customer service industry because they don't even care about their own customers!
Phoenix, AZ 85024~5~Aug 19, 2021~Went today for the first time when they opened! Their hours are updated on Starbucks website, (for the haters out there mad that google was wrong...). The inside is very nice and designed very modern, and the service was quick and polite.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Sep 5, 2022~Starbucks is worth going to for a great experience, usually. Then every once and a while you stumble upon entitled, rude people with a major attitude problem. Unfortunately this Starbucks has succumbed to this. I hope they have a staffing change soon so the store stays open the next time Corporate Starbucks makes a round of cuts. When we got to the drive thru ordering kiosk, Em started taking our order. I ordered an `"Iced Latte Breve with a pump of chocolate.`" Em then proceeded to tell me `"okay so you want an iced latte with heavy cream and half n half with mocha.`" To which I responded `"no I want breve, not cream.`" Em then got frustrated and Jamie took over. Jamie (Sadly, I believe this is the manager) was extremely rude. She said `"That sounds like a Dutch brothers drink. Here at Starbucks we don't use breve. Half and half and cream are the same thing.`"This is not true, as even the Starbucks app can tell you - half and half is breve and heavy cream is heavy cream. Breve is a term I have used at Starbucks regularly for decades. So to have someone patronize me in this way was unacceptable. We were going to drive away, but decided to show them what we want on the app instead. We drove around to the drive thru to order at the window. Em immediately started raising her voice at us, to the point where my daughter had to step in and tell her to tone it down a step. Em then scoffed!! And walked away to get Jamie. We explained what happened yet again and said the attitude is not acceptable, and it's not ok to talk down to a customer when we aren't wrong. Jamie then made her voice sickly sweet and said `"we just want to make sure your order is what you want, so we have to ask questions.`" This is utter bullshit, to be frank. Breve is a term used by Starbucks. To be talked down to by a manager and practically yelled at by an employee is unacceptable. And then on top of it - to have them do NOTHING about it. To stand firm in their attitude and insist that they are in the right. Not. Ok. Like I said, hopefully they have a staff change soon. For the sake of the other people who work there
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Jan 23, 2022~Truly the worst Starbucks of all time, I know that's saying a lot but it's true. Slow service, always run out of food. Now they are drive through only and don't have half the items, but since it's drive through only you still have to sit in the mile long line instead of being able to walk out. It should honestly just close down
Phoenix, AZ 85024~5~Feb 1, 2023~bro literally look at how much caramel is on there holy shit this starbies is so fire aswell i usually order a strawberry açai refresher with lemonade and one time they gave me a trenti when i ordered a venti literally made my whole day tbh but today i wanted to get something like rlly sweet and i ordered online which i usually do and they gave me so much caramel good god.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~3~Oct 22, 2021~Just went to this location for the first time tonight... I ordered the same drink I got from a different, (more established) Starbucks in a different part of Phoenix last night. The drink sort of tasted the same -- but definitely had a different look to it... so that was interesting. Tonight's drink was a little meh honestly. But by far the worst thing at this location is the overpowering sewage smell!! Unfortunately the city is doing some kind of work on the sewer lines and they are running above ground for like a quarter-mile... And the smell is indescribable. I was going to order a snack but that smell just turns my stomach so it's better to just get your coffee and snacks and drive away very fast! Oh but you can't... the traffic coming out of here is bad no matter what time of day or night. (Again, mostly due to the sewage work and lane closures). If you have the time, might be better to go south to Bell and Cave Creek until the sewer lines are back in their rightful place six feet unde
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Aug 23, 2022~very unkind , especially one worker with the name of Ashlyn . She has very poor customer services skills and is very rude . She was extremely short with me . I was trying to drive my kids to school and be in a good mood for their sake and instead I was left unsatisfied and insulted to say the least. Please do something about this attitude or train your employees to have better customer service .
Phoenix, AZ 85024~3~Sep 8, 2021~Chaotic location to get out off. It took longer to get out from parking lot than to get the coffee.Latte had no froth whatsoever and tasted too ordinary. Coffee cake was soft and moist. Nice modern interior and brand new feel is good.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Oct 16, 2021~Unfriendly...worst Starbucks I've ever been to.  After I paid 8.50$ for scone and latte they would not give me a coffee refill. This place is getting way to greedy for me!   I will go elsewhere, hope others do also!
Phoenix, AZ 85024~3~Sep 22, 2021~It's a nice place, workers are nice, &amp; they work pretty fast but i've been there about 5 times now and my drink has been super inconsistent in terms of taste. I ordered the same thing every single time (same size &amp; everything) but my drinks are always taste super different. They are either really bitter or just sweet enough.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~Incredibly good experience while our first visit to this location. Super sweet service and cashier. They were welcoming and went way beyond with offer that saves $ for us. Store has good safety measures for corona. Marking with six feet distancing. Store is no entry zone. Order from the main door and receive your order at same place. They have setup a table on the door blocking the entrance. All associates had mask and gloves. Following all guidelines needed. Coffee and refreshers were just being Starbucks so no need to say anything about that. But service was fast and loved the experience while chatting with associates.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~Starbucks is definitely my fav! The coffee is so delicious. They always get it right. I've never had a bad experience with a staff member
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~5 people working, one taking orders &amp; one making drinks. Please make it make sense?!?
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~May 25, 2020~I LOVE this Starbucks. They're friendly and most importantly my drink is always made properly/the same no matter who makes it. My fav in the entire Phoenix area by far. When you're spending $10 on a drink, you want it to be made right every single time and that's why I go here.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Dec 9, 2023~Decided to meet a friend at this Starbucks since it was middle ground for us. The place was located in an outdoor shopping area. The inside was clean, but they were missing anything that would normally be at the condiments area (probably due to COVID protocols). The seating area was very limited. (Probably another COVID thing.) So we were lucky to find a table inside. There was outdoor seating but with it being over 100 degrees out it wasn't an option. I opted for an iced Pumpkin Spice Latte. This was the first time I went iced and not hot and it was good. My friend had a modified PSL but they did not get her order right. This is the reason for the rating. Also the team members working weren't very personal and just seemed in a hurry to get orders and get drinks out. All in all it was Starbucks coffee so it met their standard. We may or may not be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Nov 11, 2023~I came to this Starbuck's location Tuesday morning before going into the office. It doesn't have a drive through, so you'll need to park and enter the Starbucks.Inside the Starbucks location was relatively clean and well stocked. There are two registers. The staff at the location was super friendly and quite helpful. I had ordered a special order, the chicken, bacon, sausage biscuit, without the sausage. I also ordered a medium hot chocolate.Service was super quick! The individual preparing my hot chocolate put whip cream and chocolate syrup on top as well! The order didn't take longer than 5 minutes to prepare! I was in and out of this Starbucks quickly!The chicken and bacon biscuit was interesting. It could of used a little extra flavoring, maybe a added egg and additional cheese. The hot chocolate was perfect! Sweet and delicious! I'll be back here again for breakfast!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~May 19, 2024~Seems like a nice Starbucks overall, but I was disappointed to find that there were no outlets by any of the seating.  Was hoping to make this a new study location, but I'll have to find another unfortunately.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Sep 1, 2021~This place is right across the street from where I work , two times this week they have been out of cold brew.... They said (and I quote) `"they keep forgetting to make the cold brew`" I work in the food industry and that would NEVER fly at my work ..... they are great when they don't `"forget to make the cold brew`" ..... but who says that ???? And whoever is in charge of cold brew ..... maybe they aren't qualified? Just a thought ....
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~May 14, 2019~Walked in no one even looked at me to say hi just silence. Stood their for minutes to even get acknowledged, the girl says to go order? Saying yes shows my order hasn't come in yet even tho I ordered it 12 minutes prior to showing up. The blonde manager telling me I probably choose another location, assuming the customer was at fault. Order finally came in their machine when I made the order 12 minutes ago. The blonde manager then made the drinks, did not even say goodbye to me. Everyone at this location needs to learn to at least say hi to the customer. Disappointed
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Nov 11, 2023~Love coming to this Starbucks because first it's close to my house &amp; 2nd I'm a regular here &amp; they love getting to know their regulars. It gets super busy at this Starbucks though. I love using my Starbucks mobile order so I don't have to wait in line, cause sometimes the line is all the way to the door. Also when I do use mobile order it takes abit long sometimes cause it's super busy. My favorite drink is the caramel frappacino.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~every single time i order extra inclusions it's like it's there way of seeing extra and deciding to put half of 1 scoop... like this is not 3 scoops of inclusions...
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~Liam is a great manager. He was accommodating and honest and made my experience to this location a pleasant one.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~I've been waiting for 10+ mins not been acknowledged once. Not one employee will look my way. I had to stand where no other customer can receive there drink until they would acknowledge me. Lane a young female at the register could welcome everyone else into the store but me. Cidney lane and Karen have absolutely terrible attitudes. Do not stop here. Literally saw an entire building order there drinks and receive them before they could look my way. Typical young workers
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~May 12, 2023~Busiest Starbucks I've seen and I've been to allot.. waited half hour for iced coffee..something about their order processing/ mobile orders
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~May 28, 2022~They don't give you a full serving of coffee. I appeared for Carmel and got like one tiny line of it. I've been here twice and they don't seem to know what they're doing. Unfortunately for me it's the closest one to my job.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Nov 27, 2022~You can't go wrong with a pumpkin spiced iced coffee.    And it was waiting for me when I got to the end of the bar. This may have been the fastest service I have ever received at a Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Oct 5, 2022~Annoyed! The banana nut bread that I received was hard. I asked the cashier for a fresher piece. She informed me that all of the banana bread were the same. Strange response; however, I figured that perhaps I could warm it up once I arrived at work. Once at work and prior to warming, I opened the bag and noticed that not only was the banana nut bread hard, it appeared to be burnt (like it had been previously heated up). If I wasn't already at work, I would have taken it back. Instead, I now know not to visit this location again.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Sep 10, 2022~The drinks here are delicious but they are always so crowded. I used the app to order and pay ahead thinking this would help but no. Many customers were frustrated with the wait and there was only one drink maker. I arrived and my bagel was given to me without cream cheese and I waited 20 minutes for my hot chocolate and by then my bagel was cold as I waited for cream cheese too. I love Starbucks but this location has to do better at completing orders before jumping on new ones. I would say being more friendly would help too. I am willing to give them another try.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Sep 7, 2019~This is a well laid out store, the staff were friendly and welcome to accomodate my particular irregular choice!Parking in the mall can be a little chaotic. has wireless, outside seating with shade.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jun 17, 2021~Sweet/friendly staff. The place wasn't really too packed when I went in. My drinks were made correctly and in a timely fashion. Only thing I don't really dig about this location is how dim the lighting is. It makes me sleepy. I recommend it if you need a pick me up and you're nearby!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~I am not big on reviews and I typically will pick a small independent coffee house over Starbucks any day of the week. However the one in Barns and Noble on Happy Valley Road is the exception. The reason why, the people who work there. The are all very considerate, patient and excellent at customer service.If in the neighborhood, and in need of a coffee, this is the place.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~I have never written a review in my life but that upset me too much to pass up. I picked up a mobile order latte (grande) I felt it seemed a little light almost as if someone drank it. I opened it and this is what it looked like (didn't take a single sip). I told the baristas who told me this was normal for this coffee and were extremely rude. They said this is what it looks like. I order this drink multiple times a week it's never been this way before. 6 dollars for half a cup. This is basically a tall in a grande cup. I Will never go back to this location. Terrible service
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~~Just ordered the new black and white mocha. It's delicious. Sometimes their new drinks are overly sweet or just a little too adventurous, however this one is on point. If you are a big chocolate fan definitely try this one out. I'm hoping they keep this drink year round. So as far as the service at this specific location it's normally really good. I have gone in some mornings and the gals are overly talkative and it slows down the line. I try to avoid this location if I'm in a big rush. Anytime else during the week when you aren't in a rush definitely stop by this location, they will make you a great drink
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 16, 2017~Be prepared to guess when your drink is ready.They make the drink ok clean place but the Barista girl just wants you to guess and ask her which drink is yours
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jan 31, 2021~I came in yesterday and ordered 8 pumpkin spice lattes one for myself and the rest for my baby boys daycare!!! I got all of them safely over to the daycare while juggling baby and then got back out to my car to find that only mine which was soy was made wrong with no pumpkin so I took a big gulp of soy and espresso yuck!!! Hillary there made sure coming in this morning that I had a replacement as I hadn't the time to go back and trade it out yesterday! That is the kind of stuff good service is made in! Hillary and this location get a huge gold star!!! Thank you for making my morning!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Dec 28, 2017~Worse than before. Asked for a dark pour over (as for some stupid reason all Sbux stop brewing their good (dark) coffee after morning. Watched barista finish up the pour over and proceed to top it off from the tank of Pike! She brought it over and I said `"did you just put Pike in the pour over?`" She said `"yeah I wanted it to be full.`"  Clueless. Unbelievable. Manager remade it but took forever and NO real apology, get the sense they do it all the time.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Mar 2, 2021~The reviews are right -- slow, inefficient, small, poor quality shots of espresso (weak and not as hot as it should be). No drivethru. Avoid this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Oct 19, 2017~Stopped off here a few times when we were over in the area. They are always quick and efficent with moving through any lines. The staff is friendly and helpful.They even were kind enough to fix a drink for me when we stopped through after going to a different Starbucks close by that messed up my order in their drive-thru and we were gone before I tried it (too hot to try right away). The cashier was very nice about it.Overall: AGreat staff, quick to move things along and clean.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Dec 3, 2018~Having worked for Starbucks years ago I know what it's like behind the bar. What frustrates me about this particular store is it never really seems to be `"busy`" but they are consistently slow! I've been coming here since they built it and I've seen staff come and go. Still one of the slowest Starbucks locations I have ever been to!I'm not sure why exactly but nobody ever seems to be in any kind of hurry behind the bar. It's aggravating knowing I used to be timed at how fast my crew could crank out drinks at some of the busiest stores in Arizona. I am a loyalist, and I'll keep drinking the coffee, but I think I'm done here and ready to find another location to visit. If you're in a hurry, STAY AWAY from this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Dec 11, 2017~I was in the other day and the walls and shelves were very bare. Made me wonder if they're going out of business. PROS:1. Parking is easy.CONS:1. Extremely slow service 2. I asked for easy ice and ended up with a venti 3/4 full with ice.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Oct 15, 2014~Stopped in for a drink and I noticed a dog inside a car with windows cracked an inch. It was 97 degrees out. He was panting and looked in distress. The car doors were locked so I went back into the store asked the Manager to please call 911. I was shocked to hear that per company policy they're not allowed to call the police. REALLY?   Smh! How pathetic.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~~too focused on mobile orders, and don't acknowledge that to their cafe customers. i waited 15 minutes for a coffee, when they whipped out 20+ mobile orders that weren't even there waiting for their coffee. when i was handed my coffee, the barista seems almost annoyed to give me it `"here you go.`" no thanking me for my patience or apologizing for the wait - the most basic rule of customer service. the mobile orders sat their for at least 5 minutes before someone came in to get it. need to reflect on their priorities for customer service. my coffee was good tho :)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~I was so sad when the starbucks on 39th and pinnacle close down. I literally work 6 stores down. So I can walk down on my break and get my venti GREEN TEA WITH BERRIES. Yummmm. now that they move it to 39th and happy valley with a DRIVE THRU its so hard to go there. The line is so long and same goes to the drive thru.When they first open i went in and they recognized me right away and remember my drink instantly. Great costumer service and great drinks :)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~~Very friendly staff! Bathrooms were gross, paper towels everywhere. Nice location in Happy Valley shopping center!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 16, 2021~I don't normally leave reviews but today I was having, well, let's just say the most Monday-like Friday ever. It was bad. So bad that when I placed my order on the Sbucks app, I didn't realize I clicked a location over ten miles away from this one. When I showed up and noticed nothing on the counter with my name on it.... YUP! There was no escaping the worst day ever. Ugh. The gal at the register was so sweet and immediately took my order (as the original one was probably getting cold at the other location) without missing a beat. I was so upset and fighting back tears that all I could do was show her my order because any second I was going break down....Stressed and overwhelmed, when she asked my name I could barely say it without choking on my tears of frustration. My items were ready within, no joke, 60 seconds and I left just in time to dial into a very important conference call. I am so thankful that this location turned my morning around just by simply being attentive and understanding. Thank you to the morning shift today! I appreciate you!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Aug 19, 2013~Small location, no room to sit after the few tables they do have were taken.  Seems like a bunch of stragglers just bought a coffee and then all their friends sat down next to them to veg out all day.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Jan 9, 2017~Always serve up coffee as ordered.  Must have hit rush hour, as the place was pack and line to the door.  Baristas are quick and wait was not long.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jan 10, 2020~Amazing customer service. Hillery suggested I try a sample of the new mint mocha frappicino and it turned out to be fantastic. So loving this Starbucks and their customer service. I had to call tech-support for help with my mobile app and they were so helpful and quick.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Apr 2, 2017~I showed up a little after 5am... On a Sunday morning. The girl behind the counter was both cheerful AND friendly. The coffee was hot and tasted great, too: Five Stars for being open so early and seeming to be happy about it! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Aug 24, 2016~Horrible service. They messed up my DCC frap up! Like actually, they messed up my Double Chocolatey Chip up, and I asked for a refund. The lady said `"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?`" and nearly threw her stupid pen at me! How DARE YOU, Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~May 5, 2017~Dylan was so kind and counted out $6 in change that we used to pay for our order. Our Frappuccino's came out SO fast and we're delicious of course. Definitely recommend this Starbucks to anyone who needs one!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~Fast and friendly service.Inside was clean. Service station well stocked. Volume level of music and patrons calm and low-if I planned to hang out, it would be pleasant.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~I come in very early in the morning during the week, and in the early afternoon on the weekends - and the girls that are always working are so awesome! Once they've seen you a few times, they remember you every time after! They used to remember my drink until I started changing it up on them =)I will just say that I've gotten a Three-pump vanilla cappuccino with extra foam from here, and they've made it the best I've had from any other Starbucks. It was so good I drank it so fast when I normally sip on it slowly. They also know how many times I've checked in here, even on Facebook *giggle*.This location gets extremely busy because it's in a popular shopping center and it starts right around 6:45am up to 9am. I've seen the line going out the door so I'm glad I get there around 5:45am! I like this location the best not because of the coffee, but the customer service from the early morning girls makes it a great experience every time!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~~The wait here was atrocious!!! Took over 20-25mins for coffee (this was after we waited 10mins to order)?? I usually order the special (which right now is (Chestnut Praline latte with coconut milk..yum)..however if you are In A HURRY DO NOT GO HERE!!! Extremely slow service!! Coffee was good(same as other Starbucks just a Very Very long the wait) and they did make it right (nice enough too but didn't even apologize for the long wait?) ... Everyone else had the same expression is the wait really worth it for Starbucks chain coffee?? If you are ever in Bay area try Philz!!! The wait for coffee is worth it (.mint mojito at Philz is my addiction!!!)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Aug 5, 2016~I'm giving this location 4 stars because it's usually very good, but I went here on Saturday at it was absurdly slow.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Dec 9, 2015~I must say, we went in Christmas morning and all the young people there were extremely nice, wide-awake and did their best to make sure everyone had a great experience.  They were even celebrating because one of their co-workers had just graduated from ASU.Great team work especially since my husband and I are pretty certain that they would've rather been home enjoying the holiday with their families.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Dec 27, 2015~Had coffee here twice both times the coffee was terrible. I had a latte I don't know how they can mess up a iced latte the coffee taste really bad seems like it's set for too long very slow act as if they're extremely hurried. Good thing it's not close to my home will be going to other Starbucks for much better coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Feb 27, 2019~I come to this starbucks quite frequently and have never had bad service until recently when Jesse started working there. Every single encounter I have made with him I have received nothing but attitude and rudeness back. Sometimes he starts off nice and then quickly escalates to an attitude when it isn't even a high stress environment at the time. I don't usually write reviews but it's really unpleasant when one person can make your favorite go to place your least favorite.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Dec 26, 2015~The staff makes this a great store! They often remember me and asks where my daughter is when she doesn't accompany me like she normally does. They are usually pretty busy and seating is scarce in this location. If you are going to get work done it might be hard to find a spot. And if you do find a spot, it might be hard to get work done.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Jun 27, 2018~Located in the strip that faces Lowe's, just a few doors down from Ray's pizza.  I've had bad service a few times at this location, the seating is excessively limited, and the parking can be bad at lunchtime because of the surrounding lunch spots.  Worst time is a weekend at lunch when the lunch parking &amp; Lowe's parking are so bad that it fills the span of the parking lot between the two.There are a lot of young college aged kids working at this location, so that could be part of the problem.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~May 30, 2019~My drink order consistently gets messed up. The Baristas do not listen or pay attention. Not to mention half the time the lid is not on the cup all the way. My least favorite Starbucks but it's close to work.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~~Slowest Starbucks ever. Line from the register to the door and yet absolutely no sense of urgency or desire to speed it up by employees. If only recommend coming her if you have a lot of time to spare. There is no drive thru to help with orders which may effect the speed. Might be good for a weekend relaxing but not for wanting to grab a coffee before or during work.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~This location is excellent. The staff is always friendly, rarely out of any ingredients and have great consistency in drinks. The baristas are quick, listen well and never mind making something right if a mistake happens. Hillary is my favorite person in the world!Please don't go to this location though, I like the lack of line ;)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~~The latte and croissant was very good BUT the barista decided to go outside to his car and was more interested in what was happening outside than in making the drinks. Don't know if he was concerned about the police outside or what. He totally lost interest in my coffee when he was halfway done. Another barista took over and I finally was served. In summary coffee good barista mesmerized by the world outside.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Sep 1, 2017~This is the slowest starbucks on the face of the earth. And they don't even have a drive thru. It took 15 minutes to get a breakfast sandwich and coffee, after I reminded them I was still waiting on my sandwich lol. There were four employees present.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 21, 2015~Megan matinas amazing!, she gets her job done and makes everyone's day 10x better than it already was I beg you give her a raise!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 2, 2017~Great baristas that work hard. Very busy in the AM between 6-9 and especially so on Double Star Day. Mobile Order is awesome, but you have to disregard apps wait times and you need to wait a bit longer for your drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Nov 12, 2019~I haven't been to this location since in a while. My drink and food was great, as can be expected. The only problem is they are allowing pets inside. This dog is not a service dog.  Leave the animals outside.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Jun 11, 2017~The barista that took my order seemed kind of annoyed that I had a few transactions to take care of. Once I placed my order, I patiently waited for my drink...I then saw the individuals who were right in front of me get their drinks and I was thinking I would be next. I stood there waiting for the barista to start making my drink, I watched her pick my cup up and set it aside as she continued to make 4 other beverages before getting to the beverage I ordered. I watched 4 people behind me get their drinks and leave before I was able to get
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Feb 8, 2018~I've yet to have a bad experience here.  I'm always greeted and served promptly.  Although, I only come in during off-peak times.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Jun 6, 2017~Basically your average Starbucks. The baristas are friendly enough, the seating is rather limited and the parking can be a pain depending on the time and day you go. I go here out of convenience when I need a frappuccino or white chocolate mocha fix. Nothing spectacular, but also nothing horrible about this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~~Its November 2nd...yesterday I enjoyed the Thanksgiving blend without the tryptophan after nap and didn't have to wear my stretchy pants either. Today I went for it. Full on Red Cup Skinny Peppermint Mocha, that escalated quickly into the holidays.  Oh yeah, it's AZ, I've got my flip flops on and I'm on the patio. At least my pedi color matches my cup.  Otherwise it would be so awkward.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~Never get my order correct through the mobile order, and even completely lost my mobile order to collect stars. Waited over 15 min for this order. Finally asked the barista where my order was and she said they didn't have it so I showed her my mobile order receipt and she made the drink and of course made it wrong. So I asked if she could fix it, cause lets be honest if your going to pay 6$ for a coffee you've been waiting on for over 15 min, you want what you ordered. Well upon asking if she could fix it, she went ahead and made yet another persons coffee before mine. Great customer service. (Complete sarcasm) I'll be so relieved when a Dutch brothers comes to norterra.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~If you like a coffee shop that literally screws up your order every time - THIS IS YOUR PLACE!!! My order is simple, pike place with heavy whipping cream and stevia. The only thing that changes is the quantity, do I want 1 drink or 2. And more often than not, ITS WRONG!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Nov 2, 2014~Awesomeness. The coffee is great!We are pretty new to Starbucks and the person helping us have us some free samples of coffee.The cake pops are amazing! Definitely recommend. Super nice staff!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Aug 27, 2017~Food quality and taste aside due to it being a chain restaurant the thing that sets apart Starbucks from each other are the people behind the bar. This location has some great, friendly people who tend to make a consistent drink. Like other reviewers have mentioned, this location can get slammed (especially around 9AM) but it is a function of high demand as opposed to incompetent or slow baristas.Overall, a good location with stable, amiable staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 22, 2019~I cannot say enough great things about this staff!  They always make the perfect drink and they staff is AMAZING!  Tammy, Hillary and Rene are phenomenal women!  Their service is second to none and are always so personal with their customers.  I have not been to another starbucks that had a staff half as good as this one!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Dec 14, 2016~I'm a general contractor and as the old saying goes, time is money. Well if that's how you operate your life than this is definitely not the Starbucks for you. I have been in there probably a half a dozen times and every single time it has been the absolute slowest experience of my life. The people behind the counter just go on and on and on chatting with one another and tiptoeing through the tulips. I don't understand how it can be that slow when every other Starbucks is so quick. Normally I would just go to a different location. However this happens to be right next to Lowes. So when I go to pick up my material in the morning this is my only option. They need a new manager, someone that can change the culture.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~May 26, 2012~At first I was disappointed that they moved from Pinnacle Peak because that location was across the street from my house. However, their new store on Happy Valley is so much nicer. Great staff &amp; excellent drive thru service!The people that complain about the slow drive thru are probably the same people ordering all their `"special`" drinks that aren't even on the menu.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jan 9, 2016~By far the most friendly and happy Starbucks I have ever been in. Usually I go through the drive through (because of my laze craze) but this one did not have one, FORCING me to go in. I'm so happy I did, the costumers were happy and seemed like they knew the staff well. The boss had her kids (on her day off I assume) and they were having a blast with one of the male baristas. Thank you Happy Valley and i17 for putting a smile on my face.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jul 26, 2016~Baristas were perfect, personable, and fun! Ordered Two of the same drinks and there were amazing!!! One of the best Starbucks experiences I have had!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~Always slow! Like, HORRIFICALLY slow. Counter girl is always worried about what the others are doing rather than paying attention to taking the orders correctly. These girls would NEVER make it in a real city setting! They would be CRUCIFIED!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~Extremely friendly staff! Great vibes at this Starbucks. The employees always make you feel like home here.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~The baristas at this Starbucks are so busy socializing amongst themselves that you have to wait until they finish their story to get your coffee.  I suggest you bypass this store for another of the multitude of other Starbucks in the area.  Once the management teaches their employees to put the customer before their own need to socialize then maybe you will get your order in a timely manner!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Jan 21, 2017~My daughter (who is very beautiful)  was just totally ingnored and treated like she wasn't even there by the staff!   We are from VA where you just don't do that.   They really need to learn manners.    Apparently the woman in front of her was treated like an old friend.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~May 8, 2016~If your a regular there, your drink always seems to be ready quickly.  If your not, well um then plan on waiting. I've come across a few employees there that are in the wrong line of business. I know how I like my $6 cup of coffee and it shouldn't be so hard to write it like I order it on the cup. My drink is always wrong if one employee in particular takes my order.  Don't get me wrong, there are several nice employee there that you can tell they love working there. But there's always a bad one or two in the bunch to ruin it for all.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Dec 5, 2016~Not my favorite staff here, but the drinks are pretty consistent and as long as you order ahead with mobile ordering you'll be all set.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Nov 5, 2016~I wish I lived closer to this location! starbucks customer service and friendliness has REALLY gone down hill. BUT this location is AMAZING! Such great and nice staff! And fast service!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Sep 1, 2016~I love this location. Prices are normal for this chain andparking is convenient.  Pretty quick service and lots of smiles
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Mar 15, 2018~My favorite Starbucks to go to! Always have to go pick up a big order of coffees for the office and the barista Lexi is always so polite and helpful.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Jun 19, 2018~Service at this location is faster than the one on Pinnacle Peak Road (about 37th Ave).  But it still takes some time while the servers chat with their regulars.  Seems odd they cannot make the beverages while talking.  And work faster.  This company should know people have places to be.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~I come here everyday before work and I love that the baristas make an effort to get to know me. A few actually know me by name when I walk in the door. Not sure if that's a good thing or it means I drink too much coffee.  ;) Either way, I love everyone who works here.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~~I ordered a simple iced tea and waited about 8 minutes. All while a couple of people that ordered after myself and others received their drinks. There were two employees working in front and I'm not sure if it was because one of them was new or what the case was. The family ahead of me had to wait even longer.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~It's a Starbucks. Friendly staff at this location. They get the orders right and they are what it seems staffed properly as the line and orders are done in good time.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Jun 29, 2017~This is hard to say... But I do not enjoy my visits here. They are slow, crammed, difficult to get in line, and even harder to find space to wait for drinks or even fix my drink after. I love SB but this one needs a bigger store and better service.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Mar 24, 2016~Seriously the best Starbucks in AZ. We live right near by and are frequent users. The staff knows us and our usual orders and are ALWAYS friendly. We are and always will be loyal customers to this particular Starbucks. The only con would be no drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Jun 5, 2016~Horrible. Waited almost 10 minutes just to order (at 7:45 am) as people in front of me ordered multiple drinks and multiple food items. One cashier, one barista, one person making food. Patrons stacked up waiting for their orders. Left without my drink I'd already paid for, as I was out of time.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 14, 2013~I love this Starbucks location! All of the staff is very friendly and my order is made perfectly every time. The baristas are patient and take their time to ask you about your day. I, of course, drink Starbucks a lot, and I would recommend this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Feb 16, 2014~This location is so convenient being across the street from me, but their customer service is so horrible. All employees have the worst attitudes even when they make my coffee incorrectly. I gave them so many chance but never again. I havent stepped foot in this location for months. I have to travel couple extra miles to another Starbucks that gives such a great customer experience. WORST STARBUCKS LOCATION!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Jan 28, 2015~The floors were extremely dirty. Bathrooms need attention. There were only two people working, and they chatted more than they work. It took over 20 minutes to get a drink. I suggest you drive the extra mile and a half to the Starbucks at 29th Dr and happy valley. A much better  Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Sep 29, 2015~We all know that there so many variables that can go wrong during the morning preparation for work, all of which have the potential of starting the day off on a negative note in some cases these things can change the course of the whole day. This morning my experience at this Starbucks was just the opposite.. The drive through line was short and the team was not only friendly, but extremely knowledgeable.As a former Starbucks employee I can say this team is rare! Consistency is key to me and they've got it all!! I pass by two other Starbucks locations each day to this store because I know they will help me start my day off right every time!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~~This Starbucks store is super crowded in the morning. Expect to wait 15 minutes for your order. The sun is hot and blinding inside, making the wait uncomfortable. Staff was nice. They work like machines cranking out many dozen drinks in rapid succession. Sucks for them and totally not relaxing to watch. My suggestion is to find a less marketed coffee shop if you want to experience a cozy cafe experience -- an experience all but lost at most Star bucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~Been to this location many times but every time it takes forever to place my order and forever to get my coffee. I at least wait in line 10 minutes and then 15 to get my drink. There are at least 8 people behind the counter all talking to each other with no work being done except them discussing their personal things amongst each other. Other locations do not take this long to get coffee. More focus to the customer instead of each other employee would help speed up the line and produce even more sales. Other locations provide faster service and they even have a drive thru! So if you want to use your whole lunch hour to only get a cup of coffee this location is the place for you!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~I go to so many Starbucks and this place by far is the best! The morning crew always greets everyone with a smile and that kind of customer service is very hard to find!!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Feb 8, 2017~I go here a lot.  Everyone there is friendly and remember me and my drink that I order.  It really don't get any better!  This place can get busy with a long line at times...
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jun 16, 2017~I love this store! The staff is kind and patient. I highly recommend this branch. They even helped me with my homework!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 19, 2014~Great people, they make a real effort to remember everyone that comes in. They always say hi to my little girl too. Great coffee and customer care. I will always go here before other locations.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Sep 9, 2012~I absolutely love Hillary, she is the nicest person and will go out of her way to help her customers and make sure you have a drink that you will love. The rest of the staff is great but Hillary really stands out to me . Thanks Hillary for all you do.  Tammy
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Mar 22, 2014~i used to be an everyday regular here. baristas knew me by name and had my drink memorized. service was always slow ... friendly (most of the time) but slow. but i kept coming back because they knew me. stopped by again thursday morning, hoping it had improved. it hadn't. from the time i walked in the door to the time i got my coffee, i had wasted 17 minutes of my morning on a damn latte (yes, i really did time it). screw it ... i just don't have time for this place. if i have an outrageous amount of time to waste, i happen to need coffee, and i'm in this parking lot, i may return, but probably not.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Nov 7, 2014~The worst Starbucks I've been too! Horrible service! They shut down their oven 35 minutes BEFORE closing on a week night and informed me AFTER confirming they have a sandwich and after they charged me. I don't like to write ANY reviews, let alone a negative one but this Starbucks should be avoided!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Jun 10, 2015~The staff here is very nice there is just never enough of them. This is not a single occurrence. I was third in line this morning and from the time I walked in until I walked out it was 13 minutes.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~i have been to this starbucks so many times and they continue to disappoint me. i have had two orders they didn't do right. a worker there is rude and i'm not going there again
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~If you  want the slowest service when 2 people Are making drinks  then for Shure come here.... This is why old people shouldn't work at Starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~~I'm new to the area and have used the mobile pick up a few times. The first time they were not accurate on the ready time and I had to wait an additional 5 minutes for my drink. The second time I ordered it with a few extra minutes so I could just grab it like I'm suppose to. I go to put my straw in and I can't. The ice was just a chunk so I had to ask for them to get it out and put normal ice in there. This last time I just went and my drink was not in the mobile pick up area (the tri level platform) and instead was just with all the other drinks. So I stood there and waiting only to find out they didn't place it in the right spot. Why have a certain spot for things if you're not going to utilize it?? While I was waiting I overheard a woman ask if the steak sandwich had avocado spread and the Starbucks lady said, `"you have to ask for it.`" It says it's on it on the menu, but she argued with the lady about it. I've been going to Starbucks for YEARS... not going to that location anymore even though it's so convenient!!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Jul 16, 2018~I love Starbucks for the yummy very berry drink but the girl there this morning had such a tone and negative attitude.   I wanted to remind her that her job also requires a smile and positive experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 18, 2013~Very helpful.  Barista took the time to explain perks that will keep us coming back! Thanks Hillary!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jul 21, 2017~I am a Canadian and was in Phoenix for the winter. I ended up walking up to this Starbucks most mornings for a Latte, and very soon was welcomed by name by the staff in the store. They were all positive, wonderful, friendly people. When they were busy they always apologized for the wait. I am back in Canada now and miss my Starbucks visit each day. I am looking forward to coming back to Phoenix next winter and will definately have this store on my schedule when I return. The coffee is much the same in all the Starbucks I have been in. What makes this a great store is the fantastic staff!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Nov 5, 2024~Slow service... Drinks take forever to be made, regardless if they are busy or not. When I use my mobile app at this location I give it a good 20mins before I show up. When the drinks do come out while you are waiting the employees rarely call out a name, they just put them on the counter and never look up. Overall the employees are rude and rarely make eye contact or have any interaction with you. When you order a cold drink there is rarely enough ice in it. Music is always too loud and most of the time, the genre they are playing is not exactly Starbucks approved... The only reason I continue to go to this location is due to convenience. Hopefully somebody from Starbucks corporate or someone that cares from this store sees this and makes some changes to this location for the good.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 10, 2024~Leo was great and I would like to thank him for cheering up my morning. Good luck with your competition!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jun 16, 2022~Wow. Just not a good vibe.Tables and chairs smashed against very hot windows. Only spot not that way basically in the trash can. Two male employees only interested in yelling stupid repetitive jokes to each other while female doing all the work.Grimy. (See pictures) I wanted to chill for 10 minutes with my overpriced long awaited coffee and as I sat almost in the trash can the genius guys cranked really disturbing yelling `"music`" that came on suddenly and about gave me a heart attack.AWFUL
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 28, 2023~I tend to order through my app, but on my trip here I did that and ended up adding something else when I got here. I love books, and they have a mini library set up in the corner. I don't spend much time inside, I like to grab my items and go, but I could see the perks of hanging out here. They even have a couple places to sit outside if you choose. The service is good and so is the atmosphere.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 10, 2023~The lady at the cash register today was so sweet and bubbly! I didn't catch her name but whoever was the cashier at this location this morning at 7:55am you are such a kind person and I really appreciated that!! Be sure to tip those who show up to work :) I like this Starbucks because they are fast and efficient as well!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 9, 2023~Still love going to my 43rd Ave. and Thunderbird location almost daily I always get an iced caramel macchiato grande bring a Venti cup, so I can get extra ice and double caramel!!!! Love in a cup lol.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 17, 2023~43rd and Thunderbird is the best Starbucks ever!!! Always make my drink perfectly(3yrs and two months straight) 59th and Union Hills has messed up 3x now in 3 months!!!!Keeping at one star so 59th doesn't get any credit.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 16, 2023~Wow I really got screwed over today.. straight milk.. plus I order a grande with extra ice and a Venti cup and this is what I get!!! Corus more it was often listen milk milk with a little bit of coffee. They did not offer to remake it for me or anything like that. Usually do this place to stay straight zero. Don't let the Carmel color fool you.. it's caramel milk lol absolutely no coffee in here. I will update on this next time I go to Starbucks somewhere else. Show what a Starbucks drink is supposed to look like.  This review will be posted on Google, Facebook and Instagram.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Sep 2, 2023~Kasia the store manager is amazing. She runs a great team and is the best at talking to her customers. Store is always clean organized her partners are always super nice and respectful. Food and coffee is A+ as well
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 17, 2018~This place is usually packed with people either studying or just chilling. Love their caramel frappacino. Also you can order your drink thru the app and have it ready when you get there.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Sep 13, 2021~I grab Starbucks pretty much every Friday for my kids. My normal location didn't have my daughters drink but this one was close and had it. They do not have a drive thru however, they do have curb side pickup. Inside was clean and organized and our mobile order was ready to go as soon as I walked up to the counter. The employees were friendly and I'll stop in again if I'm close. Thanks!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 24, 2023~One this that this location knows how to do is to FCK UP YOUR DAMN DRINK!!! I get shaken espresso every day and i try to avoid this location as much as i can but unfortunately i live close to this one so on the weekends i end up getting some here and get coffee in Scottsdale WHICH HAS THE BEST LOCATION! This place needs to shut down!!! Staffs have disgusting attitude when you call them out on a drink they fckup!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Apr 14, 2023~I stop here and pick up a mobile order every morning! The last few fridays has been a complete joke the people are slow as shit and work with sense of urgency. Mind you I place the order around 620 every morning and it take me just a couple minutes to get there but it's always ready minus fridays I walk in one drink is ready and the other is stand the while these two people take there sweet time and watch my drink sit there and the sweet cream foam just need poured on it it sat there for at least 15 minutes till I said something. Then the excuses started. The crew on Friday is a joke and I will definitely not be stopping at this on fridays ever again I will drive a mile or two out of my way to work to save time from here on out!!!The Friday crew is the reason for the 1 star and I wouldn't of even put that if I didn't have to! As for the crews Monday threw Thursday they kick ass and my drink is always perfect!!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~May 17, 2022~The team members at this particular Starbucks are the best and Starbucks is very lucky to have them, in particular Allison and Gilbert.  Alot of personalities pass through their doors and they pretty much keep their cool remaining polite, even when being spoken down to (can't use the `"b`" word here!).  They pretty much know their regulars and it's nice to be acknowledged for all the $$$ that get spent here weekly.  I figured out that monthly it's the same as my car payment!  Thank you for being the best in the Arrowhead area of Glendale.  Corporate should be proud of you.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jul 4, 2020~Completed a mobile order for this location and was told it would be ready in 7-10 minutes. Arrived after 5 minutes and was immediately greeted by staff. They requested my name and already had my order (wrap and drink) ready for roll. What more do I need from Starbucks? My only complaint was they were a little heavy handed with the milk in my latte, but it still was good.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 21, 2023~Honestly, I love Dutch Bros. But the the ridiculous long lines through it's drive through service and in-person service is definitely a drag. While the customer service is absolutely amazing, the employees should stop having personal conversations with customers while the lines are backed up. On top of that, its customers are no doubt extremely picky with their choices which further creates the long lines. There is no doubt that Dutch Bros KNOW their lines get like this but do nothing about. Using the same, tired, outdated, servicing model. Do better or lose customers.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Feb 6, 2018~This Starbucks sucks waiting over 30min to order bc some girl in front of us `"claims`" she works at a different Starbucks but doesn't know her employee # or anything... she was ordering 10 drinks got her other job bc I guess if you work at a Starbucks you get a buy one get one free deal?!? Soooo were waiting and waiting and let's add this girl was a total bitch to everyone. Pretty sure she doesn't work for Starbucks because their staff are always so overly friendly it's awesome.So finally we order we are basic venti iced coffee with classic/vanilla cream. One I'm sure the staff is all annoyed and flustered by this annoying girl.. BUT don't mess up our drinks mainly when it's written on the cup what we get!!! Omg we already waited 30 min come on make our drinks right. No joke just iced coffee with cream So sad but I hope next time we don't run into this issue again.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 28, 2019~Friendly baristas, they had my nitro cold brew w/sweet cream ready before I even sat down &amp; playlist is poppin' - major kudos! Used to coffee over hipster tunes playing in most places, so not sure if it was today's specific playlist or if they always play the slaps but it fed my throwback, 90's/00's R&amp;B soul!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~May 10, 2019~Go to this Starbucks on occasion while my husband is at the chiropractor next door. I always mobile order when we are at Bell so you'd think my drink would be ready...never the case at this location.Order a Trenta Mango Dragonfruit refresher and one Grande Mango Dragonfruit for the offspring.  When entering there are about 3 people at the cashier ordering. The barista behind the counter is working quick but the girl in front of me must have had 10 drinks he was making. My son and I wait...and wait. Several people that came in after us and ordered at the counter have now left while we still wait.  So I finally ask. Oh sorry we only have one of your drinks. We ran out. Ok shit happens I get it but one would have thought since I was standing there for so long one of the three people working would have asked what I ordered. And to add insult the `"manager`" said you only ordered 8 minutes ago...so I get a Pineapple Black Tea Lemonade instead, or so I thought. The girl with the indian accent even asked do you want it sweetened.  Finally get my drink. Walk back to the chiro office and find it's just black tea. Not pineapple infusion or any hint of lemonade. I probably won't be going back. Two stars because the `"manager`" gave me a $4 gift card for the inconvenience of no refresher.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Aug 12, 2017~Pretty typical Starbucks location situated relatively near Midwestern University. Tends to get a bit crowded during peak hours though there are extra tables outside. Service is swift and drinks come out at a relatively fast pace even when the place is packed. Definitely a good location to grab coffee, study, or chat.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jan 19, 2022~The staff is friendly! It's smaller and cozy. They have a tiny book shelf with books to read!!! This place makes me happy.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 18, 2021~Second day ordering through the mobile app and having the drinks made poorly.  Cold Brew tastes like hot coffee poured over ice, espresso shots were so watery that my husband's latte tasted like straight  up milk.   Staff has seemed nice but the product sucks
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 16, 2017~I went to this Starbucks location yesterday after I messed up on my mobile order. I meant to send it to that location and accidentally sent it to the one by my work. I walked in, explained to the barista what had happened and BOOM! she instantly grabbed a new cup and started taking the order for me. It really meant a lot to me that she did that. I hope that someone from Starbucks corporate sees this and gives the staff a high five for me because they truly deserve it. That's exactly how you would hope your employees would treat their guests. Thanks for my green tea frap with protein! A full belly and a smile really go a long way!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 12, 2022~These people work very hard at this location. People and their stupid mobile apps.  To the lazy customers who are TOO lazy to get out of your car and walk in like normal people. (Curb service) To the customers who use your stupid moble apps and drive in, fly out of your vehicle and crowd the counter as to keep people from seeing their coffeesplace. To the IDIOTS who sit in their cars with the engine running while people are sitting outside trying to enjoy their coffee. Absolute Idiots.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 29, 2017~I came to this location because it was close to my moms house instead of my usual and it was pretty busy. It was pretty dirty even at the pick up counter. I always do mobile orders and this one was a little chaotic. They keep mobile orders behind the counter and you have to wait for someone to notice you. Just was not a good experience.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Dec 29, 2015~Quite possibly the slowest Starbucks in AZ the barista today looked like he was confused on what he was doing. The guy who took my order asked what he could get me and then started having a side conversation with his coworker a female and then turned around and looked at me and said I'm sorry what can I get you?? ReallyI called and warren answered the phone and his excuse was well in case you didn't notice were busy??? Your barista doesn't know what he's doing dude! If your that busy as you claim to be hire more people
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Sep 3, 2019~My favorite Starbucks in my area, and I live next to a newly opened Starbucks store. The employees are all so sweet. I never made much conversation with the baristas, but they all know who I am, so now I do mobile orders and the minute I walk in they already know it's me and hand me my drink. There's a guy that works at this Starbucks in the morning who is awesome. For how busy it is they all work so quickly.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Feb 5, 2018~I gave this Starbucks another try.  Much better!! Friendly and glad to help.  I'M HAPPY NOW!! Thank you Jason!!Long wait for my chai tea latte that taste like warm milk. I threw it out. I'M NOT HAPPY!!! Starbucks chia tea has been a favorite of mine for a while now. I've visited numerous Starbucks in my travels and never been so disappointed!!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jan 31, 2018~Long wait for my chai tea that it taste like warm milk. Threw it out. I'M NOT HAPPY!!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Sep 6, 2020~Shelby, Thank You!!! For always smiling, helping me figure out how to work my app, helping me order my coffee the right way  You're AMAZING AND I APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU DO
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Mar 3, 2019~Perfect Starbucks, friendly and fast! Always upbeat, great place to work online. I recommended this Starbucks, adding a Drive-Thru would be nice.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 17, 2021~they are the truest and friendliest of baristas!!  always being challenged and always coming through with a smile on their face!  They are all truly remarkable!  I just enjoy going there, it makes my day! and for some reason, they are the ONLY ones that can get my mobile order correct.  insane.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 10, 2018~I love their service! Mobile order is the way to go with this Starbucks since they don't have a drive thru. You get skip the line and will get greeted by your name by their morning employees if you happen to become a regular. I wouldn't recommend trying to get work or studying done unless during mid afternoon. There is not enough space and it seem chaotic during busy times.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Sep 27, 2019~So I love Starbucks I get the passion fruit tea lemonade sweetened. The barista messed up my drink and didn't sweeten my drink and I waited even longer because she messed up the drink in front of mine and the drink in front of that drink. It could have been just a bad day. when i walked back in because I noticed my drink wasn't right once I walked outside I was like this drink isn't right and the girl just gave me a blank stare and was kinda like what do you want me to do and she's like what drink did you get. Kinda with a attitude.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 27, 2018~I love this location, even without a drive thru. They're quick and accurate employees make it a quicker trip than the Starbucks closer to my house. I've grown accustomed to preordering on the app and picking it up on my way to work. I've noticed too all the employees no the regulars by name. Very welcoming team there!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Feb 28, 2018~usually stop here on our way out of town and have had no issues. Good decent starbucks. nothing to complain about
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~May 31, 2018~This is by far a Starbucks that needs the most work. My drink is never right and I order the same thing every time every Starbucks. Why do I return? It's the easiest one around to get to. So I am a repeat customer and at this point accept that I will receive a subpar drink.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jan 28, 2018~Incredibly slow service. They need coffee there selves. Hardly any people here and still took over 20 minutes for my order
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Apr 5, 2018~Why is this place closed at 8:30pm? I've tried several times and yup, closed at 8:30pm. Dude sweeping the floor obviously doesn't have any will do make me some drink. Please do something.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~May 4, 2015~I am pretty much a Starbucks addict {hey- admitting it is the first step, right?}... So I had been frequenting another Starbucks for several months until my route to work changed and I decided to stop at this Starbucks instead, which was a big change b/c the other one was a drive thru. After the first cup- I was hooked on my new Starbucks location! The drink was 4 times better and they were way friendlier! I think the  volume of the business takes a toll on this location- yes, and it is hard to keep up. HOWEVER, I see people in their daily sitting at the tables utilizing them (inside and out) and regular customers... that means they are doing something right.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Mar 31, 2018~Not enough ice and it tastes watered down already. Girl making drink wasn't too pleasant either. Won't be stoping here again.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Mar 17, 2018~Yes it's a franchise but they're not all the same. Things such as keeping the coffee as fresh and hot are part of the foundation of a good coffee house, and this one performs. The staff is friendly and dedicated. I always enjoy coming here, thank you!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~May 3, 2011~Pretty standard Starbucks. Friendly staff. Hot/ cold drinks....Right next to Midwestern's campus and it closes at 9:30?!?! NINE THIRTY. Where the heck is the closest 24 hr Starbucks??!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jun 20, 2020~It's Starbucks so everything is good. This location is not my fav, I had a wrong order (didn't realize until too late) and lengthy waits for drinks. I will obviously so back since it's Starbucks but if there's another option I would go.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Nov 22, 2017~My favorite Starbucks! I've gone to every one in the metro area. I like the 'take a book-leave a book' and they have the reserve coffees which I prefer over the pike/Christmas on tap at the other stores. Their quick to fix things if anything goes wrong and the bathrooms are always clean.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Dec 27, 2019~Worst customer service I have received at a Starbucks , Carrie was very rude and kept telling me to wait for no reason. She also kept rushing me while I was giving her my order and would not wait for me to finish talking. Then she goes to say it's small medium large, like if I was unaware of their sizes and names. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Apr 27, 2012~This is one of my coffee sources before a longday's work. Staff is very friendly and consistent- doesn't seem like there's a lot of turnover here.Quick service and they always have my favoriteChicken salad with Tarragon sandwiches when I actuallywant to eat something as well. The only bad experienceI had here was when some obnoxious fellow kept askingif my name was Dan - I guess he was just trying to figure out which customer there was his Craigsfist (sp?) connection.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Apr 20, 2015~Yuck! This place was so dirty! Napkins and trash all over, dirty windows and tables. They had half and half out only for my coffee... And the people!! I don't think they even knew I was a person. I have been to TONS of Starbucks... This place by far takes the cake for the most disappointing! Sorry won't ever go back into that one again. Really makes me appreciate the others and what a great job they do.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 28, 2017~Love this location right by my house! One of the baristas knows me by name as soon as I walk in.. I feel so bad I don't even know his:/ amazing service and they make the best drinks.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~May 4, 2014~New guy Arthur.  Learn how to treat customers better. You were rude today!  I LOVE this location. If you don't improve will choose another.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Feb 28, 2014~I'm from Ohio and I LOVED my local Starbucks.  I have to give this location a 5.  Always friendly....ALWAYS getting my order correct....as busy as they are the line moves quickly.  Newly remodeled and looking fantastic....not my Oakwood location but the next best thing!  This is my 2nd review.....and the baristas are still making my visits awesome!  I thank you!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 26, 2013~This is my FAVORITE Starbucks. Friendly folks.  They ALWAYS get my order right and thank me for coming.  I visit as often as I can!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jun 12, 2014~Good spot to get a coffee,  but the attitude of some of the baristas need to remember that they are there to make coffee. My friend and I were both told what we wanted would take awhile instead of saying it will be longer than usual,  it's like they dreaded the thought of brewing coffee....aye
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Feb 26, 2020~Disappointed again getting a cold coffee on the way to work.  Almost went back but was in a hurry.  This is why I usually avoid this Starbucks because it always happens.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Dec 31, 2019~Brought my 3 girls in to your store over winter break as a fun treat, we usually stop at a store close to their school.  Carrie was so helpful and patient as I let each of my girls place their own orders.  We will definitely be coming back.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Mar 5, 2019~Disappointing. Went there yesterday and waited forever for my mobile order. No one acknowledged me. Turns out The guy who made it, left it behind the counter, as he was off for the day. No apologies made to me. Waited 20 minutes for watery coffee. Was in a hurry so didn't get anything else. Wont be back.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 9, 2012~This is my regular coffee spot, even though it's not even the closest Starbucks to my home. The employees are FANTASTIC. They always greet me and my grandparents by name. They have all our drink orders memorized. They make the BEST drinks by far of any location I've ever been to. If they don't make it right they go above and beyond to make it right for you for free. My only complaint is that they haven't hired me yet! ;)
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Feb 6, 2018~Love the employees. Greet regulars by name. Are patient as we decide if wanting to try something new.  Clean and comfy seating.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Dec 23, 2017~They are extremely slow. They need a minimum of two cashiers.  They only have one the many times I've been here.  They also need to clean the cream and sugar area more often.  Not my usual Starbucks experience that I have had at other locations and cities.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jan 24, 2019~Thursday 1/24/2019 at 9 a.m. English is my second language I'll try my best to tell you what happened to me at this Starbucks store. I was awaiting for my iced tea and a coffee an young employee gave a an iced tea first while I was waiting for the coffee accidentally I dropped the iced tea all over floor the employees right away came and cleaned up the mess for me and I was planning to buy another Iced Tea but the the same employee gave me another tea right away without charge. .After I got my iced tea and coffee I opened the doors to get out somehow I accidentally I dropped Iced tea and coffee all over the floor again I was so embarrassed to picked up the cups, said sorry to everyone but everyone was just smile and gave me the looks that they understood the situation and forgave me my mistakes. Again Starbucks employees helped me out and offer me another iced tea and coffee with all the beautiful smiles.I did trying to pay for the iced tea and coffee again but she said she loves to give them to me again without charges.It was a bad morning at first but I saw Starbucks employees and customers at this store were so nice to me. I'll never forget yours kindness. You guys are awesome. Goddess you and peace to be with you always I'm an American now and I'm very proud to be part of your community.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Aug 21, 2016~Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon, the place was dirty, trash overflowing. They got my (very simple) order wrong and the guy gave a bit of an attitude when I pointed it out. It's 100 degrees and I'm sitting outside because it's dirty &amp; freezing in there. No thanks.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Feb 17, 2016~This Starbucks has slowly gone down hill, one of the girls who takes my order almost any evening that I come here is always really rude and she always messes up my drink when she writes on the cut but has no problem charging me for soy. And then when I tell the people who are making my drink that is supposed to be made with soy because I can't drink milk they decide they're just not going to put any whipped cream on it which I wanted. I constantly have to have my drink remade at this location and every drink tastes different even though I'm ordering the same drink. I really feel like consistency is an issue with a specific Starbucks, maybe it's just me.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 15, 2018~Received the best service tonight from Jaeden (I believe his name was) and recommended me a new drink, which was exactly what I needed! I asked which drink would best keep me up for an exam tomorrow needing to study all night and he recommended a vanilla sweetened cold brew w/ extra caramel &amp; extra shot of espresso. Thank you, J
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Dec 22, 2015~Slow service... Seems like they aren't in any hurry.  Waited for my drink right by the barrista while others came and went.  Finally looked and my drink was sitting there.  Never heard him call my name. Whipped cream completely melted. Other than that, the drink was fine.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 9, 2017~I am always pleased with this location/staff/service! One employee always stands out! Her name is Susie (manager)! I love everything about her! She has a great disposition/attitude/she is so knowledgeable/helpful/very polite...She is a big ASSET to the Starbucks Corporation!!! She is the #1 reason that my friend/ I go there!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Nov 7, 2017~This is my usually location when I do drink Starbucks. Today was just way off- girl couldn't get my order right at all and it was a simple order but took 4x--my tall iced vanilla latte w/ caramel turned into: tall hot caramel latte, to a vente iced vanilla latte..I think she just wasn't focused... My drink tasted like ash because the guy making it was pausing a lot to chit chat. Maybe it was the timing. (Around 4:30pm) cause usually it's fine and not awkward.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 22, 2018~My favorite Starbucks! It's always the same employees working and they are so extremely friendly. They greet me instantly by name when I walk in and it seems they are that way with a lot of people who must be regulars. It makes for a nice environment when they remember names and details about you. Especially when they already know what your order is! ;) amazing staff! See ya'll tomorrow. :D
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jul 7, 2015~This Starbucks location is all right.  I feel that one of the employee need to be aware of their facial expression, especially when there's an interaction with customers at the register...perhaps a friendly smile would go a long way, after all, their job is to provide customer service.  I am sure this person is a nice individual, I would like to feel welcomed at this location when I come back.., if ever .... I felt not welcomed here and would feel uncomfortable coming back to this location.  Otherwise, the rest of the employees are great!Might I add, if you just want to read a magazine or a good novel, this is the place to go.. Maybe....However, due to sometimes high noise level, either with music or employees who really enjoy their job, (good for them!), this will not be a place to go if you're trying to understand a physics concept or trying to understand the functions of the nephron.  LOL!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Feb 1, 2010~Located at SE corner of 59th ave. &amp; Union Hills, this small location always seems to have polite and prompt service.  The only downfall is the smaller than average seating area, and given the proximity to the medical college nearby it can be hard to find a seat.  Just a few doors down is Rosatis pizza and a new Spanish tapas bar, so it's in a nice location within the strip mall.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 26, 2018~i love starbucks and the staff. i pretty much live at starbucks. the drinks and food are amazing and the staff is always welcoming and willing to fix your drink every time if you're unsatisfied.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Feb 25, 2014~I used to like this Starbucks, but now I love it.  They just remodeled Jan 2014, and now they have a Clover brewer.  If you are a coffee fan, then make sure you try the Clover!  I like that they have remodeled.  Also they have very friendly employees.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Nov 5, 2011~If I've come to your Starbucks over 30x within 5 months and you still don't bother learning how to pronounce my name correctly then I don't know what to say. I always order the same drink: quad espresso with 3 pumps of white mocha and 80% of the time they don't get my order right! The baristas always ask if I want water or milk with it.. Seriously? I ordered a damn espresso for a reason. If I wanted water or milk then I would've ordered something else and NOT an espresso! And my drink is one of the simplest drinks to make too!! Just brew 4 shots, mix in white mocha syrup and add ice.. But they always somehow mess up by asking me stupid questions. If it weren't  for this sb being the closest to school, I would definitely frequent the Thunderbird location!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Feb 4, 2016~Coffee tasted awful, never had this bad coffee before. Ordered a latte, but it tasted like water. Won't ever go back to this place ever again.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Mar 2, 2014~They're incredibly slow. Give yourself extra time if you come here. The first few times I tried to justify it by guessing they must be short staffed or have the `"B Team`" working but No... Every time I go to this location I wait in line for 7-10 mins before they even take my order. Maybe this doesn't sound very long but I go to Starbucks bc it's fast and easy. If I wanted to wait 15 mins for coffee I would go to some local coffee shop.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Aug 15, 2012~My sister and I come here a few times a week if not more. I will have to say that mostly the only reason i keep coming is for one of the workers here .. Mercedes ALWAYS makes my drink PERFECT. If  not for her, none of the other girls make my caramel machiatto right at all. But Mercedes is so very friendly, she remembered my name from the get-go and not too long after memorized my drink (which is pretty detailed and specific) This Starbucks is always packed (good for them). There are a few workers here who are not friendly at all and really need to take a few customer service classes (but i have found this is the came with most Starbucks.) But this is definitely my favorite Starbucks :)
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 29, 2015~Went in for my coffee at 11am and they are out of vanilla flavoring. Obviously not a well stocked location !
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 12, 2015~I met a new potential client here for my side health and fitness business.  He ordered a cameral mocha something or other and I got a water.  Service was fast and his drink was good.  My water was amazing.   The dude with the long goatee was hysterical.  Overall the place was quiet and it was easy to talk.  Perfect place.  I will be back.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Dec 28, 2013~This seems like a pretty hip place to hang out, grab a drink and people watch. So busy every time I come here and the parking is not too bad. A casual hangout and lots of groups come here as a meeting spot. During the weekdays a lot of students are doing homework but all in all, great service and decent place.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Dec 30, 2012~Staff is friendly, service is great. Drinks are fantastic!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 5, 2015~This Starbucks is my go to after every workout and a convenient place to meet friends! Friendly staff and very quick service!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 4, 2014~Nine am on a thursday morning and not one piece of toilet paper in the restroom.  Really??? Um yeah I just drank coffee.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 11, 2014~Negative baristas heaven forgive they mess up your order and u ask them to remake it. No asking if it was right the second time, still not right but they are so rude ur afraid to ask for them to actually try it again. Also soooo sloooooooowww come on people drink some coffee and get motivated... lets work on niceness and speed.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 25, 2015~Excellent coffee.   This location is always super busy.  I would suggest buying/leasing the space next door and expanding, better yet we have no drive through coffee location going East from this location off the 101 freeway; make that happen and you would be the most popular Starbucks in the surrounding.   Other than that excellent coffee.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 18, 2013~Impressed with how friendly and efficient the staff is. Can't complain about the coffee either.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Dec 8, 2013~Love Starbucks! Friendly service and love the coffee. They always get my drinks correct and I never have any problems or complaints.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Feb 16, 2014~This is by far my favorite Starbucks. I go here at least once a day well headed to work and the staff is always friendly getting my drink in a timely fashion. The advantage at this location is the staff has been there for a very long time and have wonderful team work.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jul 7, 2015~Great coffee, but two male employees were yelling (jokingly) with each other for over an hour.  Too loud with employees and music cranked.   Not the best day to try and study.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 7, 2015~Let me start off by saying I've been a Starbucks gold member for a few years. I mostly go to this location since its closest to my Apartament and used to really like it. The baristas knew me by name and were generally friendly and attentive. Recently a lot of the staff here has changed in the worst way possible. One afternoon I had come in to study for an hour or two and had purchased a hot white mocha with my gold card. I stayed inside the entire time (sat at the bar area) and before I was getting ready to leave I went back to the register to ask for a tea refill. I brought back my empty cup and took out my gold card when the barista said `"you can only get a tea refill if your original beverage  was a tea and it has to be within an hour of your first purchase`". I asked if she was sure about this, and she turned around and asked a male coworker who nodded to her and she turned back around and gave me an annoyed `"yup`". Baffled I thanked her anyway and left. As soon as I got home I went through every Starbucks faq page I could find and on each one the rule is clearly stated, you get unlimited free refills regardless of the original beverage purchased with a green or gold member status ( and no mention of any time frames whatsoever). Now let me clear, I don't mind paying $6 for a cup of coffee all the time, or the fact that my name is butchered on those darned cups, or even the bored and annoyed facial expressions the baristas always seem to have.... But when I'm denied a measly tea refill that I'm clearly rightfully asking for and bombarded with false rules that are nowhere to be found on any official website I officially give up. The audacity of the management to not train or supervise their staff properly is baffling. I've since fallen in love with the coffee bean near my place and never plan on returning.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jan 8, 2016~The apathy was so thick you could cut it with a knife (my subject header). I have thought about writing a review for this location for the last year when declining positive service and long wait times became the norm. But today was really frustrating, so I finally made the effort. About to order and just realized that I had left my wallet in the car I asked the order gentleman at 12:15 on 1/8/15 if he could begin a Oprah chai tea for me while I got my wallet. I told him I was in a hurry and he could see I had waited patiently already and then there was a line of 8 people behind me. He remarked he could only prepare the cup (with a really unpleasant attitude) which I thought meant he would get the drink in the que and started. At Starbucks we are used to them smiling, asking about your day and even writing your name on the cup. This was absent but more troubling was the complete unwillingness to help. Got back in line with a $20 out and asked the gentleman if he had started my drink...no he had not...decided to leave, out of time. When I left I couldn't help feel sorry for the workers, they looked miserable and apathetic. Long line and just 1 cashier and 1 on the drinks...2 doing assorted work never looking up to help move patrons along or even acknowledge with a smile. They obviously don't like working there and had no accountability to the place of business. This usually means being poorly treated by management/leaders. I give them 3 stars because I think these apathetic workers due their best with what that locations management is offering them. I hope work conditions improve for them in 2016!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Feb 18, 2015~Standard for a starbucks. Usually with great staff that I really liked so far. Until I ordered coffee from a girl with rude attitude working on Weds afternoon, who needs more training in customer service. I've worked in service before, and this is not how I'd train my staff. First time I ever felt very annoyed at this location. Other staff members are great, but I'd rather go to the Fry's starbucks island than come for attitude if that happens again.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jul 12, 2016~Whenever I stop here it is always full and I wish I would have gotten a table sooner with this heat. Diane is always sweet and makes my drink perfectly. I don't know what the other reviews are talking about since when I go the staff is friendly and personable.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 1, 2016~Always friendly and coffee delicious! Love to walk here from my house and sit and drink my coffee. Caramel macchiato is delicious! Usually busy but the employees do great at keeping things moving along!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~May 4, 2011~What the heck can I say? They've got my money and I admit I a little bit of a junkie. Staff here is quick and friendly, place is clean, busy as usual... I hate that they're close  to my job.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 29, 2014~I'm not the kind of person who orders the same thing every day so their patience with my choosing is great. They always recommend something when I don't know what I'm in the mood for and it always hits the spot. The one down side to this location is the wait. Often the line is put the door and there is no place to wait for your drink to be ready. The added room from the remodel didn't solve the problem but it did speed things up a little.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Dec 7, 2014~I love the location of the store, all the baristas are very friendly and nice, and my drink is always made right. However there is a customer -*Dave* I believe his name is, who is beyond annoying. He is there every single morning and when he sees me he starts talking loudly and joking and making sarcastic comments to me. I don't even know him!!! He does the same with lots of other customers- as well as the baristas. I can't stand it. I have started going to the Starbucks up the road, in the Frys store. So much quieter and no harassing old men.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Mar 13, 2014~I would not recommend going here in the afternoon of Tuesdays and Thursdays especially if you are tight on time. I usually go here before class because it is on my way so first time I went it took two girls 30minutes to make my drink and on top of that it was made wrong but after that point I was running late so I couldn't have them make me another drink and who knows how long would that take. I decided to give them another try and this time only one of the girls that serve me last time was working. I was first in line and she made 4 other peoples drinks first before my drink was made. The guy that was working with her came back from the back and asked me if I was still waiting for my drink and only then she said that my drink was next. At the end when I got the drink she threw the straws on the counter versus giving me one.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Jul 16, 2024~Just paid $6- for ice, ridiculouscheck out the pictureJust paid $6- for ice, ridiculouscheck out the picture
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Aug 16, 2023~I was nearby for an appointment so decided to grab Starbucks for a pick me up. This location is connected to an Einstein Bagel, they share a bathroom. Anyway, it was ok, small inside. There was no wait so I got my drinks. Staff were friendly. Didn't look newer inside, could use some updating.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Mar 14, 2021~SB well located at Thunderbird and 59th ave.It is very small, with no indoor seating but there is a nice patio. There is no drive thru. Staff is very professional and quick with orders.Recommended above avg Starbucks.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~May 26, 2022~This was once my favorite Starbucks location. A while ago, the excellent manager that was here left and things have gone downhill ever since. I come in here a couple times a week, but today is my last day. They didn't have a dark roast available and they were not willing to give me a pour-over, unless it is Verona. Yes, they had Komodo Dragon in the store but I was told that they are no longer able to do that. I don't know if this is a companywide policy, but other locations are willing to do it. It's either time to find another location or a new coffee place...
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Nov 17, 2023~This location is great ! I want to thank Becky for being so awesome !!!! Someone accidentally took my drink and she remembered my order once I told her my name... I couldn't believe it ! She really is amazing !! Thank u Becky for making my day... and thank u to all the ladies there today! U guys Rock!!!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Nov 12, 2023~I've had with this Starbucks!!! This is the WORST location!!! It says they close at 7PM and everyday is a different closing time, sometimes it's 3 pm other days is 4pm then it's 6pm! Which one is it??! That's why in this location you can't order ahead because in their system it has it open until 7PM! So they turn it off!!! Its ridiculous! I get it close it early but MAKE UP YOUR MIND ON THE TIME and change it on the website!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Jul 5, 2022~Idk if they got new employees or just a barista but my coffee taste like milk, my tea taste like water, and frappes taste like shaved ice. Get it together, Starbucks is expensive and even when I tell them if they could remake it, the remake is still very gross. I'm very upset about this, this was my favorite Starbucks but lately Starbucks has been failing because it's not only this location but various ones. There's measurements for a reason USE THEM STOP BEING LAZY and USE THEM!!!! Staff is nice.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Oct 13, 2019~Now, I'll start off by saying I LOVE Starbucks. However, with that being said I swear they have a contest of which store can have the worst parking lot! Lol all the Starbucks in my immediate area have horrible parking. This particular Starbucks does not have a drive thru either which I don't mind but I know can be a make or break for others. This Starbucks is attached to an Einstein's Bagels which my kids love so sometimes a tea turns into a drink and bagels when we come here. Everyone here is very friendly as I find with all Starbucks I go too. I will continue to come here when I'm in the area and I need a drink fix. Thanks Starbucks for making my mornings brighter!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Oct 18, 2021~Go in five employees one person taking orders, one customer placing 10 orders and no one else will serve you ?Terrible !No common since, everyone is in a daze !
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Jun 21, 2023~Excellent service. Recently moved to the area and this location is clean, friendly and timely with orders.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Feb 13, 2019~Another great Starbucks location for the win today! I was in the parking lot after lunch at sushi and a quick stop at nothing Bundt cakes and was really craving their peach white tea with heavy whipping cream and sugar free vanilla. The man at the resister was amazing, funny, friendly, chatty and even offered my a larger drink when I ordered for .50 cents more and I did it. You only live once and he was awesome. I wish I had gotten his name. If you're reading this it was February 13th around 2pm, has an awesome beard and the best service of any Starbucks employee I've ever encountered. This location is pretty small, but clean, organized and fast. I was in and out within minutes and that included home orders that kept coming in. Way to go !
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~May 10, 2023~I only place mobile orders but this location is the only one I consistently go to that actually greets you and asks if you need help if they notice you've been there for a few minutes. Also my drinks always traste the best. If you like sweet coffee, try iced white mocha with cold foam
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Apr 28, 2019~What is with mobile ordering all of a sudden? It used to be when I ordered via my app when I'd get inside the place my beverage would be ready and waiting on the counter, it was like VIP service. I've found out that is no longer the case! Ordered via app on a Saturday morning, about 11ish. My first disappointment from this Starbucks is according to the app they didn't have mango dragonfruit so I ordered just a simple pineapple black tea lemonade. Inside was packed. I Waited. I Waited. And I waited some more. People that were ordering at the counter were getting their drinks before me. Several that were 4th and 5th in line received their frappuccinos before my pre ordered ice tea. Probably stood there a good 10 minutes before I received my drink. My drink was ok. Mostly ice and it needed 1 more pump of liquid sugar.With the new changes to their rewards system and the wait times I find myself going less. Get it together Starbucks, you are about to lose a loyal, go 5 times a week, sometimes twice in one day customer!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Jan 1, 2022~Visited this morning and ordered a flat white. Unfortunately I waited until I got home to try it and realize they gave me a cup of steamed milk.  It wasn't even that it was a weak shot of espresso, but that the espresso was completely missed and it was just a cup of plain hot white milk. Didn't care enough to go back to down the drain it went.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Feb 17, 2018~Pretty standard Starbucks attached to an Einstein Bros. It tends to be quite crowded on weekend mornings/afternoons, but that's to be expected. Drinks come out at a good rate and service is so great! The employees are all really nice and efficient which definitely earns this place some points. Swing by if you have a Starbucks coffee craving or are in the area picking up a bagel, grabbing a bundt cake, or shopping away at Safeway.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Feb 21, 2022~Lexi was great!   This location always has such a smiley crew!     In particularly Lexi, she was very attentive and took my order over the phone.   I appreciated that very much.    I would recommend this location for sure :)
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Sep 22, 2021~20 minutes for a chai? For a mobile order..Really? Was the lid on too tight? or maybe it was the cold foam that was holding it up.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~May 23, 2021~This is not a knock against this location but whyyy isn't there any gf options? Gluten intolerance and Celiac is a growing issue but Starbucks is one of the few chains that ignores this! Put a gf wrap on the menu. Non gf people will eat it too. Please!
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~May 21, 2017~I like that you can get (just about) the same experience at every Starbucks location. You can always get the drink you like too! This store is smaller then some of the other Starbucks around. There are just a few tables inside. The room has a nice, modern feel to it. Even with a lot of shops in this area parking is pretty good. You can always park near the store. Oh, and they do share a hallway with Einstein's Bagels (which is pretty cool).The employees are nice and you can tell they enjoy their jobs. They get your drink to you promptly. I like that Starbucks gives some benefits (like free school) to their part time employees. This seems like a really good company to work for.Starbucks has a rewards program as well. You can become a gold member after you spend a certain amount of money and then start earning free coffee/food.I would recommend Starbucks to any coffee drinker.
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Sep 13, 2021~Placed an online order for a coffee and egg bites at 1:45pm. Rec'd confirmation would be ready at 1:54. Arrived at 1:55, 2 guests in the store at the time. Neither item was ready. Coffee was ready shortly after arrival....eggs not until 2:08.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~May 13, 2019~Always busy and always a friendly smile at the counter.  Thank you for all you do to keep the world caffeinated.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Jan 28, 2022~Andrew is the best at this location. Always going above and beyond what they are required to do. Only giving 5 stars for him! Promote Him Now!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Mar 21, 2021~It took over 30 minutes to get my two drinks. Their excuse was `"there's a lot of mobile orders`" but I kept seeing people who ordered in person after me getting their drinks/food first. Very disappointed! I will be taking my business elsewhere.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~May 8, 2020~Due to the covid apparently, they couldn't take our order and needed us to order on the mobile app. What we wanted wasn't on there. When we asked for help the lady was so rude. So rude in fact that her co-worker gave my daughter a $5 gift card as an apology. And the icing on the cake.... our order ended up being wrong.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Aug 3, 2021~Love this café! It's really cute and I love the atmosphere there. Been going there for the past 4 years and all the staff are friendly. They always get my order right and perfect!
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Sep 25, 2019~This Starbucks is hit and miss depending on the barista working. Bottom line if a business wants to charge $5-7 for coffee they don't have much room for error. They need to get it right more than once every fourth visit. Unfortunately, this location regularly forgets to put in cream and add ins, makes the same drink different ways depending on the crew working, and isn't very attentive if you ask them to correct it. They often don't have drinks or pastries in stock that the 43rd &amp; Thunderbird location stocks. Out of their control, there is also a good chance you will get stuck waiting for over 15 minutes because the nearby hospital staff places enormous mobile orders with 10-15 drinks. This Starbucks is basically meh!
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Apr 25, 2021~I no longer drink coffee (got addicted awhile ago and I cut it from my life). However I went it to get some for my friends. The barista there, kind older gentleman with classy circular glasses, was absolutely amazing. He was incredibly funny and helped me navigate the menu. I can't stress how welcome he made me feel! Even though I don't drink it, I will be getting my friends coffee from here again!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Jul 11, 2018~Definitely not the best one I've ever been to. I often have to have my drink remade, and I don't really order anything special. Today a coworker picked up drinks for us during lunch and I ordered a vanilla sweet cream cold brew, my usual. I always get the same thing, either the cold brew or a iced vanilla coffee with just cream. Today's drink was literally undrinkable! I took 2 drinks and it burned going down my throat! There was almost no cream in it, and was as thick as can be. There was a layer on the bottom of my cup approximately 1/2 inch thick of sludge. I called the store 3 times and no one would answer. The pictures are of my drink after it had been sitting for a half an hour, watered down. After work, about a hour and a half later I went right straight there to have my drink remade properly and show them what I was given. The girl behind the counter said they would fix it and dumped it out in the sink behind her, intending to reuse the same cup with the sludge, until she say the look on my face. Right away she said they would use a new one, and put the old cup inside a new one, and rolled her eyes at me when I said thank you. The guy making the drinks was so quick to push me out of the store. I was embarrassed and took a drink as I was walking out the door and albeit the drink was better than the first, it still had the same burnt bitter thick taste. After they way I was treated I wasn't about to ask for it to be fixed a third time, so I dumped a bunch of half and half in it and walked out the door. I had a couple drinks and threw it away as soon as I got home.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Sep 11, 2016~Out of all the starbucks I've been to in AZ so far which has been around 20, this is by far my favorite. it does not have a drive-through which is a downfall at times, it is a smaller Starbucks because it's connected to Einstein's bagels....So there aren't very many large tables inside it's I'd say there's about eight tables or less... But the line is never that long the service is always quick and the staff is my favorite! They are always super friendly, and genuinely care about each person that walks in the door... I don't feel like just another customer when I visit this location, it feels more personal. thank you for all being awesome!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Jan 22, 2021~This location is by the far the worst I've ever been too! I ordered on the Starbucks app and when I arrived waited awhile. They made it 7 minutes late. I asked for light ice and the whole cup was full of ice. I also know the exact color it's supposed to be and it was not the color it normally is so I knew they did not make it correct. Too busy and not enough workers. Please step it up please
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Aug 24, 2017~This is probably the only Starbucks in Glendale that actual prices correctly. They are also extremely consistent with the drinks. I've been to other Starbucks and my drink is either over priced or it taste water down. I am extremely happy with this location and its staff!!!! Thank you so much for being amazing!!!
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Dec 13, 2019~This place does not have a drive thru, but I don't mind.  The cashier has worked there for years and I always enjoy his warm and welcoming nature.  There is another Starbucks on T-bird and 83rd, but it is always busy.  My chai tea was perfect and the Barista was very nice, as well.  I will definitely try to drive a little out of the way to go to this Starbucks for the exceptional customer service.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Nov 1, 2013~This Starbucks gets the `"Congeniality`" award :DWhy?*They share a hallway with Einstein Bagels! 2 of my favs connected :)Other things I like:*plenty of parking*never too large a crowd*friendly staff*police presence (there always seems to be 1 or 2 vehicles in the parking lot)Areas for improvement:*a bit slow with getting the drinks out. *although they ask you for your name, they don't call it out when your drinks ready, which causes a bit of confusion.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Apr 24, 2015~Clean store and friendly staff! Usually go on Sunday afternoon so there's usually a little long wait
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~May 7, 2010~If you are in a hurry and need your java fix, keep driving to the next Starbucks...or go to QT on 67th Ave/T-bird for coffee. The parking here stinks! The tiny lot shares parking with Einsteins Bagels and Blockbuster and is crazy. I just want to park and run in. There's always a line here too, but they make the effort to get the coffee drinks filled quickly.Not a Starbucks location that I will go out of my way to stop at, nor one I would impulsively stop at either.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Mar 8, 2011~If i have to choose between this location and the one on 43rd Ave. It has to be this one..  Why?  Because here, they get your drink out in literally 2min or less.  Im not dogging the other location because they do great on the drinks, but my God.. you can spend 20min in the drive-thru at times. If you want fast, friendly and awesome service, this place kicks all kinds of ass. :)
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Jul 27, 2015~OK, so I am not a big Starbucks fan.  In the ten years I have lived near this one I have been in maybe five times. This trip was actually for a gift card.  Even before 6AM as they were still putting away inventory that had arrived late the previous day everybody was cheerful and friendly.  They walked me through picking a card and I was out of there in quick order.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Feb 4, 2019~This store is in an area that has impossible parking BUT that's not the stores fault. I've never had them make a mistake and when they've run out of something (that I've ordered on my mobile app) they substitute with anything I ask for. They are fantastic! I had to change stores because the awful location at 43rd and Tbird always makes a huge mistake or takes 20 minutes per visit which has made me late for work more than once.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Aug 15, 2020~This location is 5 stars all around if they didn't have this one female manger. Ever time I come here and she is working it's craziness going on. She's very rude as well and half the time she's not even helping her team. The other male manager is awesome ! Everything is smooth and everyone is happy. But when he's not there no one seem to be happy to be working at all.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Jun 29, 2018~Sydney at this store made my drink so perfectly . I ordered the ultra caramel frap, with extra caramel at the bottom and the top, and it's AMAZING. I've requested extra caramel before and paid extra for the caramel that was already supposed to be on the drink... But Sydney understands the concept of extra caramel (as you can see) and it made my day! I'm very happy with this location . Sydney needs a promotion!
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Oct 16, 2019~I think it's really dumb you have to have so many characters on yelp to submit a review so I'm trying to make this long enough to post. Sigh. But really all I wanted to say is, this Starbucks has the freaking fluffiest roasted ham and Swiss sandwich. K bye.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Jun 12, 2020~When I walked into this Starbucks, it was empty. A man walked in right after me. I had ordered TWO drinks! After I finished ordering 3 more people have came in. One of my drinks was done by the time I ordered, I was just waiting on my other drink. While waiting on my ONE other drink I noticed EVERYONE that has came in AFTER me has ordered and received their drinks. Remind you, when I walked in there was no one and when was standing there waiting on my last drink there again was no one. They stopped my order to make everyone else's order. I then Canceled that last drink. Imagine being the black person waiting on one drink, they stop your order to help all the white people that came in AFTER you and your drink still wasn't ready! Very disrespectful. Maybe the rumor about Starbucks being racist is true.
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Feb 10, 2015~Good neighborhood Starbucks. Better than the one in the Safeway. Doesn't hurt that they mentioned how handsome my son is. :)
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Jun 5, 2017~Close and convenient location to me house. My first visit was this past Saturday 6/3/17 and it could've been better. No one acknowledges that you've entered the store. I stood there for about 3 minutes (on purpose) while they walked back and forth. Then a barista comes to the register and says `"have you been helped`". Hopefully the customer service gets better.
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Aug 11, 2013~The parking is crowded and awkward, but if you are already coming to this location for the bagels at Einstein Bros. next door then I suppose this is a decent Starbucks.  It is small - less than a dozen small tables- and was extremely busy on a Sunday morning.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the drink was made well (which is why I drove an extra mile and a half from the 43rd Ave and Thunderbird location).  The wait in line was over 10 minutes, but my drink was made quickly after I ordered.I can't imagine sitting to study or work at this Starbucks, but I saw at least one person doing so.As a side note, I do not like this new heated pastry thing they are doing.  I kind of like my scones cold or room temp.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Nov 16, 2017~This is my new favorite starbucks. The employees work fast and are just awesome, and super attentive. :v)
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Mar 12, 2018~*My opinion has changed a bit from this review as I have given this establishment another chance in a big way most of the time my order is taken swiftly and processed swiftly BUT my order is not always right as I think they tend to over look some of the details on the printed out order that is on the cups when making the product*.Previous reviewNot happy with this location, I waited for 15 plus minutes for ONE drink as I stood and watched 10+ people come and order there drinks in line and pay NOT pre order on the app or online and they received their drinks all before I did! I am disappointed and wish they wouldn't make up sorry excuses as to how they might have mixed it up it was definitely not that busy and there was more than enough people working at the time very upsetting and never going back and will make recommendations as to that! Pay attention to your orders and your customers! Good luck!

Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Sep 17, 2017~The staff at this Starbucks are very friendly, and they greet me every time I come in. There's been a few times where I've come in and the wait was longer than other Starbucks I've been to. Which is surprising because there's no drive thru to take the baristas' attention away from the customers inside. Overall, it's exactly what you'd expect from any other Starbucks. It's clean and the quality of the drinks is consistent with other locations.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Sep 6, 2019~nice workers and service! we rode here on our horses and everyone was so nice! one of the workers was nice enough to come outside and take a picture of us in front of the store (&amp; was very patient with our none corporative horses) and the worker who made our drinks was super nice as well. we came back in to throw away our trash and he asked how our drinks were and apologized for the wait even though it was super fast service! we sometimes don't have the best service when we ride our horses to get food or drinks but these baristas were awesome! thank y'all!
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~May 18, 2016~When i am on shift and in the area. Love coming here at getting a nice Iced Carmel Frappuccino. Staff is always nice and the store is always clean. And they share a building with Einstein Bagels.
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Jan 5, 2011~Starbucks is starbucks...it's on my way to work and if i have time i will swing thru hear. Negative is it takes forever because everyone else and their mama seems to go the same time i do. Staff at starbucks are usually always awesome, I would know I've worked at several of em ;)
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Sep 24, 2009~At first blush, this seems like a rather mediocre Starbucks. Two (or is it three) tables in a very small seating area. Look around the side of the building to see some nice outdoor tables, complete with fresh water squirted to cool you down, and it seems a little less average. What really makes this my most frequentest place for a buzz near campus? The amazing staff. Despite working for yet another soulless corporation, they create community and warmth easily bikeable from my apartment and grad school.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Mar 3, 2013~Attached o the bagel joint. They always seem to have a crowd. Great study spot. Have been to this location since it opened. Staff as changed over the years, but is still rad. Lots of food in the lot. patio is a little rough at times, evil ants in the summer do to the fact that ants are addicted to carmel frappacinos.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Jul 19, 2017~I attend this store every single morning before work but yesterday morning, I had small chunks from the cream in my coffee. Wasn't expecting that and wasn't exactly thrilled.
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Nov 19, 2013~The place is pretty clean but had to wait over  30 min just for a cup of expresso when nobody else is in front of me? Ridiculous!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~May 31, 2014~Worst service ever. I feel like everyone here has an attitude problem. They don't even greet or thank you. Ugh. I now drive out of my way to avoid this sbux.
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Jul 21, 2014~The store is very clean, and the staff is friendly. But this is the slowest moving Starbucks I have ever been to. Elect to wait around for at least 10 minutes with little to no line.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Jun 16, 2017~I enjoy coming to this location in the morning and sitting on the shaded patio. The criticism is that the bathrooms and patio are shared with Einsteins and no one seems to maintain them.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Mar 5, 2017~Every time I go here (for my wife) I leave frustrated and irritated. Never get orders correct and then when you say something they try to tell you they made what you said. And slower than death!
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Aug 25, 2016~Probably the slowest Starbucks I have been to this year. The people behind the counter only know one speed....SLOW!
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Apr 7, 2014~I love love love this Starbucks. The staff is quick and always friendly. The drinks are always made perfectly. I have been going to this Starbucks for years. I have also gone to other Starbucks when I had to based on the convenience factor. This is the best Starbucks in phoenix hands down!!!
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Mar 6, 2010~I'm a total Starbucks... hell, coffee junkie! I like that this place is small and not too busy. The parking situation can be a bear sometimes since it shares spaces with Einstein Bagels and Blockbuster, but you can park a little across the way if it was really full so it's not extremely bad. Most of the time Starbucks is Starbucks, however I find that sometimes they don't make the drinks here consistently - at times they'll taste really sweet, sometimes too bitter. I guess it depends on how the barista was trained to make the drink. But as long as I get my coffee it's cool...
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Jan 18, 2014~The big plus is that this Starbucks is attached to an Einstein's. The customer area is a bit smaller than other Starbucks, but it's got the Starbucks drinks you know and love.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~May 27, 2014~First time I have ever been to a Starbucks where the service was not friendly. No one made eye contact or even said thank you. I grabbed a snack box that was already opened and realized as I was paying. I informed the cashier and she just grabbed it and threw it and stated `"anything else?`" Then the barista added syrup to my iced coffee after I stated please no sweetener. There was no line and it still took 10 minutes to get a plain grande iced coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Nov 12, 2024~Had to stop off for some Matcha before my visit at Mayo Clinic!  They are friendly and fast!  I got my mini break and off on my way.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 25, 2022~Glad they opened up the indoor ordering. Only using the drive through made it an inconvenience. Staff welcomed with smiles and positive energy. As usual, mornings are packed but lunch time moves fast.Common for breakfast sandwiches to be out of stock during lunch hours. I recommend getting hot drinks for more volume of the drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 21, 2022~SB at a convenient location in a small shopping center at Greenway and 40th st.Staff is very professional, fast and accurate fulfilling orders.I subtract one star for small size, small patio and rundown shopping center.There is a drive thru but watch for pedestrians.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Dec 17, 2021~Stopped in for a quick coffee. Service was good, coffee was hot. Keep seeing lots of product stacked in different Starbuck locations. Perhaps a supply chain thing...
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 26, 2022~Friendly Service at All locations I frequent in Arizona.Baristas are well trained. They know how to create allBeverageS Hot or Cold Starbucks offers. Of you are not satisfied with any beverage, it will be remade at NC. They take 100% Ownership of what they provide That goes for all the food offered each day. The selection is fresh . In 8 years of being a Gold Card Member , I have neverBeen disappointed! Whether I am ordering in Phoenix or Scottsdale, San Francisco, Baltimore or Washington,DC. The Staff follows a precise training that  enables a Barista to be Personable, Responsible and Helpful at all times. The Customer is to leave having had a Great Experience
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 27, 2023~They always close early saying they close at 9 and then they are closed and the barista was so rude and my drink tasted like shit
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Sep 4, 2016~UPDTE:   I always do a mobile order, been doing this since the mobile order came out. Today, I go and wait at the end of the counter. I know the employees are in their grove with making drinks. So I stand and wait for someone to notice me and, I stand and still waiting.... Finally after I continue stare at one of the employees, she finally asks, Can I help you? I state, I have a mobile order, she stated, `" You are just standing there.... Really? I am standing here for a reason. EMPLOYEES, WHEN YOU SEEE A NEW CUSTOMER STAND AT THE END OF THE COUNTER, PLEASE MAKE AN ATEMPT THAT YOU SEE THEM AND SAY, WE WILL BE RIGHT WITH YOU!!!    I have worked in customer service for years, customers are not thrilled when they are not noticed. Fail.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 27, 2014~I have been here 2 times. The staff are friendly and didn't have to wait long for my Carmel frap, my fav! Going to continue to come here.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jan 14, 2018~We stopped through here several times during our stay up the road, usually on the way out of town for a southwestern adventure of some kind.That usually meant that we were going to coming through during rather busy morning hours.The drive through line moves pretty quickly, even when ordering 4 drinks for our one very full car of people. I got familiar Sbux drinks and was happy enough with what I got.S'all good. You'll get your caffeine (or slightly coffee-y sugar bomb beverage...to each their own) and be on your way in no time!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 19, 2021~I ordered a strawberry lemonade and it was super good. the staff was really nice, The person name zeak was super friendly and nice he complimented me on my hair which was awesome! he has the type of personality that employees have at Dutch Bros! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 27, 2016~The staff here are all wonderful, everyone I've encountered is great! I've only ever done mobile orders here and I go somewhat out of my way to make this location the one I call my own. The gentleman who works in the early mornings Trevor,  and Ashley are both great! They are on top of it and always have my drink waiting for me ! Thank you!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 30, 2021~I love this store, they always make your drink great and friendly as can be, BUT the only reason I don't give them.a 5 is the Paper STRAWS they suck. Until we get the plastic straws back I am looking for a new coffee place.This straw is hazardous,  I had it in my coffee &amp; it fell apart, just to let you know the nasty soggy paper is a checking hazard
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Nov 15, 2018~Starbucks is Starbucks and this one is consistent!  I love their app that lets you order ahead and pick up.  This one always has a line, so it's nice to be able to run in and out and have my food already waiting and paid for.  Yes, I said food, not coffee.  Try the sous vide egg white bites.  They're amazing!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 22, 2017~Stuff has no clue for customer service. Want your day ruined stop by. Felt like they doing customers a favor !!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 28, 2021~So I get to the Starbucks Tatum and Greenway or not Tim 40th St. in Greenway and at 7:50 doors locked they close at eight I tap on the window and the barista hold up a finger like a hold on a second so I wait and I knock again she points at her watch on the wrist and says that we're closed go to the drive-through well I drive a large flatbed tow truck that doesn't fit through your drive-through do you know if that's the way you were going to treat your customers who actually tip you how you make extra money and how you can afford to have different things because of people like me they actually leave gratuities I will never visit that store again
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 6, 2021~They're awesome I came here on a Thursday night! Like an asshole customer 7:58 right before closinand they were still super nice and  no attitude !!! Love
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jan 12, 2018~If you've been to one Starbucks, you know the deal with most of them. We stopped here a few times while on vacation, and mostly used the drive thru. It was speedy for for how busy it was, and the barista at the window was flustered, which came out in their customer service, but she was still pretty friendly. I am not really a fan of Starbucks, but this one was A-OK to stop at
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 1, 2021~I said I wanted a Venti white chocolate mocha with soy milk, they did not do that so I asked them to remake it, and they were very rude about it and the manager gave me the worst attitude ever. Definitely not coming back switching my Starbucks location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 24, 2019~Stay away from this Starbucks. I ordered an iced drink through the drive thru which I paid with the Starbucks app. When I handed the cashier (an older gentleman) my phone he seemed bothered and was extremely rude. When he handed me my drink the lid was not closed all the way which made the drink spill all over me and my car. When I asked for napkins the cashier and the barista (a middle aged male) were laughing at the fact that my drink spilled all over my car. This was the first time and last time I visit this Starbucks and I recommend you do the same unless you want your whole day ruined.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 13, 2019~Debbie has built an amazing team here. No matter what time of day I come through every employee is happy and humble and seems eager to help make your experience perfect. I worked here about 3-4 years ago and I truly am amazed at how consistent the atmosphere is throughout these years. My only complaint ever is just how tiny it is. But thats for corporate to change, not on them! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Sep 25, 2019~They always make my coffee on point! The only thing is every time i've gotten the guy who wears glasses mid-late 20's, he is so uninviting. Everyone else usually smiles, is super friendly, actually acknowledges me.. but this guy just always has a stick up his butr, never smiles and i just do not like his attitude.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 8, 2017~This Starbucks it great!!! Best I have ever been to. All the employees are so nice and always have a smile on there face. I have been inside and been through the drive-through. The employees are so quick and efficient. When I have my puppy with me they always ask is he wants a Puppuccino.... which is a real thing guys lol it's just a small cup of whipped cream but they love it!!!!!Now my dog knows when ever we pull up to the drive through he gets so excited and jumps in my lap and puts his paws on the window!!!! He loves this Starbucks just as much as I do!!!! I would highly recommend this Starbucks if you are in the area :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 28, 2019~Service was horrible. Was given the wrong order when I told the girl in the drive thru she gave me attitude as if it was my fault.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 12, 2016~Great service for s smaller Starbucks, off of a busy street. I was helped immediately and had my drink in like 1-2 minutes and this is while they were making drinks for a busy rush hour Drive-Thru. Great staff and customer service with a Gelato place next door, yes.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 21, 2019~I just spent 35 minutes in the drive through waiting for one cup of coffee. I actually turned my engine off. When it was finally my turn at the window I was told the reason for the wait was the employees had to take a phone call. There were four people in front of me, and six in back. The whole drive through came to a standstill because of a phone call. I think the customers standing in front of you should come first. I asked for my coffee to be stirred up and for whipped cream and for it to be hot. The coffee was Not stirred, no whipped cream and it was barely warm. I handed the employee a $10 bill to pay, and he tried to keep my change for himself. I had to ask him to give me my money. I use many locations all over town, and this has never happened before. I highly recommend no one Ever use this location! Shame on you!

Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 18, 2018~Beware if buying someone a gift at Starbucks! My daughter, who lives in another city, bought me a metal water bottle  for my birthday. Since I had just bought myself one, she told me to exchange it for the `"Phoenix`" travel mug I'd wanted. I took in to an in-store Starbucks who told me I couldn't exchange it there because they didn't carry that particular bottle. They sent me to this store who also refused to exchange it. They didn't have that particular bottle, I didn't have a receipt, it was bought 60 days ago (how they knew that I don't know). Excuses, excuses. They would not help me. Their manager was gone. Their acting manager didn't even know how to handle an exchange so I was left totally unhappy. I will never again buy anything from Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~May 14, 2018~I ordered a grande green tea latte with soy iced. It costs about $5 and I had maybe 5 sips it was all foam and had ice all the way up to the cap with barely any room for my actual drink. Once I had two sips and realized it was already half gone I brought it to the attention of the staff and it was handled poorly. I was told it always looks like that and next time to ask for light ice if I want more all of this was said with an attitude from the woman working drive thru with glasses. By the time the young man who had made my drink had offered to remake it I was so irritated I just took my 3 small sips and threw it away and left. Disappointed because Starbucks usually has great customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 15, 2015~This starbucks was super fast and cheerful! I just picked up a drink for my friend who was having a birthday and asked them to write `"Happy Birthday`" on the cup. When I came up to the window the girls had decorated the cup and wrote it in different languages. I'm always so impressed with Starbucks customer service but today definitely was the best I've ever received.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Aug 29, 2019~A nice neighborhood, quick and friendly Starbucks. Never had any orders wrong and have even experienced some awesome pay it forward situations. Staff is super friendly and efficient.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 19, 2018~This is the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. There is no reason to sit in line for 20 min for coffee. Ridiculous
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 2, 2017~Love this Starbucks. Great place to get your coffee. Employees always friendly and always make me feel welcomed. Great spot.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 30, 2014~I go to this Starbucks at LEAST 6 days a week... Mostly through the drive-thru.   I rarely have to wait too long in line, but when I do, I'm pretty sure it's because of a customer.   There are some pretty dumb people out there screwing stuff up..... Anyway, my drink orders are perfect and made perfectly about 98% of the time.  The staff is amazing and remember me and my `"usual`".  I wouldn't know what I would do without them!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 10, 2011~Okay, so I went to this Starbucks on Saturday and ordered my usual café mocha and a breakfast sandwich,the sausage classic.They did not have one so they offered me a spinach-type breakfast sandwich. It was hard as a rock, overcooked, old and I threw it away.I went by today, which is Thursday, ordered my café mocha and the sausage classic sandwich and, once again, it was old, stale, overcooked and hard as a rock. Had to throw it away as well.I called the store and the lady said, `"what do you want us to do for you`"  i said a gift certificate would be nice. Her suggestion was that I drive all the way back to their store to pick it up...Even though I had just said I could not come back to get another sandwich! Ridiculous!!I will not go back!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 29, 2020~I have a absurd amount of chronic illnesses and fat content is something I have to battle constantly. I ordered a fat free smoked butterscotch frappe no whip. My husband even asked if it was made with skim milk when we were handed the beverage... We get to our destination after picking up my drink. Start sipping... Full fat milk... My drink keeps getting made incorrectly if I don't explain that full fat, full serving, can put me in the hospital... If I don't explain it's almost like they think I'm trying to stay `"skinny`" and they do the opposite...ummmm I want to eat and drink all of the rat, not the fat in Monica's fridge, but the bacon cheeseburgers and all of the cheese cake. Starbucks is a deliciousness I can actually partake in when made with nonfat milk. The mix has my Max so if they do it with fat free milk I can be in Nauseas from my tasty in a cup. Anyway, this keeps happening and there is never an apology or a we'll make it right... It's like it's my fault. My fault that customer service no longer exists.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 18, 2019~Never have I had a bad experience at a Starbucks (and I am a very frequent customer but not at this location), this is the first time a barista never said hello or never smiled. In fact, he seemed very annoyed that I had a birthday certificate to redeem. Maybe it was the fact that he had to turn to push some button to redeem a birthday coupon before scanning my phone rather than just scanning away, which he had the scanner readily available in hand. I don't know but he was very rude and I hope he has a better day rather than ruining other people's Starbucks experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 8, 2017~Horrible coffee. Ordered the Cold Brew which I've had before at other coffee houses. This one was disgusting, like the cream had spoiled and the coffee was too bitter even for Cold Brew. The girl helping at the window was clueless as well. Not a recommended SB location!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~May 14, 2011~This is my local Starbucks down the street and around the corner near my apartment. This location is very fast....has a friendly staff....and of course the half off Fraps from 3-5 pm are the best deal in town right now. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jan 14, 2014~I do like my Starbucks - I haven't been able to choose a favorite yet although today I tried the Grande Caramel Flan Latte with Soy milk and so far, it's better than the other drinks I have had - hope this one stays around for a while.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 17, 2018~Very frustrating encounter this morning. I have been a regular Starbucks customer for years, but this morning was not pleasant. In the drive thru I ordered my coffee and requested that they not put one of the green plastic stir sticks in my cup. It was a woman that took my order. When I got to the window, before the words could tumble out of my mouth, there was a guy, and he plucked the stick in my cup. I said I had asked for no stick, so unfortunately being that it had already `"touched`" my cup, he promptly said, ok and plucked it out and threw it away. He then said he just automatically puts them in. So frustrating! Starbucks finally came out and said they will phase out straws, but why can't they also ask if you want the extra plastic instead of forcing it on you?! I would think it would save them money as a company too. I am not a crazy person. I just care. We need more people who do to start making a difference!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 18, 2017~I got to this Starbucks every morning on the way to work. I'm always satisfied with the service and my coffee most importantly.  The staff is always friendly and smiling, great way to start off the morning. I'm pretty such they are the fastest Starbucks around, sometimes the line is 10 car links and have my coffee in less that ten min.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Oct 6, 2016~This location tends to be pretty busy in the mornings, but they are fairly quick considering the volume of customers that come through here. Staff is always super friendly and my drinks are always tasty. Definitely my go to location whenever I'm at work.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 8, 2016~One of my favorite Starbucks locations. This amazing team makes my morning each day. Great spot
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 4, 2019~Every time I seem to come to this location which is certainly my last time, all the staff seem to be to hostile and don't even bother to acknowledge if you're waiting to get your order taken, like not even a simple smile or hi when you walk in. The times I've driven through their drive to order a drink they take an eternity to get the drive thru rolling. Also on top of that for some reason when I asked for light ice they seem to put extra ice and my fraps always are horrible when ordered. Take pride and passion in what you do, otherwise don't work there at all.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Aug 24, 2014~I come to this Starbucks at least 2 times a week because its very close to my house and I've been very disappointed every other time I come.  VERY INCONSISTENT. .Sometimes it tastes as it should (rarely) and the other times my frapp is WAY off.. I am a Starbucks junkie I go at least once a day (ones by my job) so I know what my drink is supposed to taste like. .I am not coming back to this location! I will drive one street over &amp; go to the drive thru Starbucks on Bell rd. which has always been consistent in their drinks.. it really makes me upset that I waste almost $6 on a drink I can barely swallow so I Just waste it and pour down the sink.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 1, 2015~I just have to say, Shane is the best!  Jessika is pretty cool too but I feel like I'm at Dutch Bros. with the kind of service Shane gives!  He's so outgoing and friendly, it makes my day every time he's in the drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 24, 2019~Usually great fast service at this location but today my boyfriend and I had a rlly bad experience, I think the worker was named Maxine or Renee but she was skipping multiple peoples mobile orders. She is lucky that both me and my boyfriend are polite because I work in customer service and anytime I mess up I'm always very apologetic! She didn't even acknowledge me or apologize once we got our items. I said `"do u have an order for _____`" and she didn't look at or say anything to me she just mumbled to her coworker and didn't apologize for the slow service once we received our items. Very disappointed because this is my go-to Starbucks. P.S she messed up our refresher which is hard to mess up.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 6, 2019~Worst Starbucks ever girl with the gauges messed up my order I WANTED iced coffee instead she give me a hot drink. Then has this terrible attitude when she has to fix it. And fills the whole thing up with ice with barely any coffee. Not to mention I waited in line for 30 min. Just bad worst service I've ever had at any Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jul 7, 2018~This location is incredibly slow and has poor service. We spent 10 minutes in the drive through with 2 people ahead of us. Our order was wrong which we discovered after diving away. $4 drink could not be consumed after that wait. The staff at the window were not friendly. Starbucks usually has much better customer service than this. I will not return to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 14, 2015~Thank you to everyone at this store! I love being able to cross the street and be able to see everyone smiling and happy to be there. Shoutout to Shane for making my white chocolate mocha perfect every time! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 10, 2013~This location rocks. Consistently great service/coffee. This is not the closest Starbucks to my house but is officially my Starbucks. Whether I go in or order through the drive-through they give me my coffee fix. Great job!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 14, 2017~Coffee and employees good. As expected. But bathroom hasn't been cleaned in months. It's not just that there is paper all over the floor but there are disgusting greasy grimey smears on the paper towel dispenser. Floors have months of grime like a gas station bathroom.  Restaurant owners have told me that if you want to see whether a restaurant kitchen is clean, check how clean the bathroom is. Nuff said
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jul 23, 2015~Nice Starbucks.  Always friendly service and pretty quick.  I usually stop here when I'm dropping my laundry off.  Can't complain, solid location and great coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 22, 2018~Waited 22 minutes for a tall vanilla latte from the time I ordered until the time my drink came. And they were not even crowded.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 21, 2015~This is a great Starbucks! They're very friendly and they really care about the customers. I bring my 4 year old daughter with me and they're so great at building a rapport with her :) Shout out to Shane and Kris for being so awesome!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 6, 2011~Okay so we all know what to expect from Starbucks. The selection is the same. So what it really comes down to is the staff. And this location happens to have superb staff. I always end up leaving this place with a smile on my face, regardless if I'm having a grumpy, frumpy morning. I'm sure the fact that I'm leaving with a giant cup of caffeine helps with that... but the people working the drive-thru are always quick with a smile and laugh, and seem to genuinely want to spread those smiles to the customer.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 18, 2011~I love the Vanilla Latte and I made up my own drink, i get regular latte and have them put peppermint syrup in it, it is so delicious....one barista couldnt belive i dont also put chocolate in it but it doesnt need it, its just wonderful and perfect just like that. mmmmm makes me want to go get one now....
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 5, 2015~My all time favorite Starbucks location. I drive out of my way for the cheerful staff and a good cup of coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 27, 2018~I just want to make it clear, before I keep moving forward with this review, the cashier, Taylor, was sweet and did her job just fine, but as for the manager or lead who was overseeing the shift (Tuesday, February 27th at 10 am), I have a bone to pick with you - and my apologies for not catching your name. As a person of the younger generation, I constantly hear about how we're `"lazy and entitled`", well, glass breaker for the older generations - you LACK compassion to the point where you radiate negativity, cause anxiety, and have someone voice their experience of your behavior and give you a bad review for your `"business`". There is more in this world than just `"business`" - there's a bigger picture, it's called Life. If I want to buy some food for someone clearly living in poverty, who has armfulls of plastic bags they've accumulated from off of the streets due to other's negligence, a hat made from ripped paper bags and tape, and looks like they could use a shower - let me do it, in peace. Do not approach them and tell them they can not be there just because they look different on the outside. They were going to pay for food but didn't have enough for all the things they wanted. So of course I stepped up. What you COULD have done was approach BOTH of us, thanked me for taking care of another human being rather than alienating them and assure both of us that our patronage was appreciated. You catch more flies with honey than vinegar. Ms. Manager/Lead, I don't care what your religion is, I don't care how much you volunteer outside of work, I don't care about your charity contributions - your public behavior was disrespectful to TWO human beings all for the sake of `"business`". You completely disregarded me, and attacked the idler. What happened to 'paying it forward'? What happened to taking care of each other? What happened to just being nice? Or is that only around the Holidays? As a human, I'm sick of the lack of compassion for 10 months out of the year, and two months of false-giving. GIVE ALL THE TIME. You can't take your wealth with you. Share it. Please let this be a lesson that all ears are listening, all eyes are watching, and I hope when I grow older, my heart doesn't shrink like yours clearly has. I understand you do have a `"business`" to run, but c'on, cut against the grain once in a while and be respectful to all unless they clearly do not deserve it. Being a bum doesn't mean you treat them with disrespect. You don't know what battles they're fighting.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 24, 2017~To start off I love Starbucks, and I'm an avid customer to multiple locations. This particular location has continued to be a disappointment. Every time I come here the girls are rude, they have no customer skills whatsoever, and they are too consumed talking amongst each other to actually pay attention to anything. I don't need someone to be overly gushing and asking about how I am or blah blah but some decency and a kind tone would be nice. The 4-5 times I've been there they've messed up my drink 3 of the times and they have never once apologized. I don't find my drink that complicated, it's a green tea lemonade, sweetened with no ice. It's heart breaking for me because it makes me not want to ever go to this location because it's so close to my work and convenient for me to go to, but they frankly kind of suck. I'm shocked that a Starbucks would be allowed to be run in such a manor, and I'm disappointed. I really hope they change their attitudes and learn some customer service. I won't be going back anytime soon.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 12, 2012~Got a white mocha frappaccino with caramel sauce blended in with an espresso shot!  It was amazing!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 21, 2012~It is always a delightful experience every time I come here. They have never messed up my drink before and everyone is always in a perky mood. They have exceptional customer service and you can tell they love their jobs. If your lucky enough to go when Allyson is working, she will always make you smile. I seem to always get her to ring me up, and I have to say she makes it more than a coffee shop, she creates a delightful `"Experience`". Well done 40th and greenway!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Apr 15, 2017~Spot on most of the time, although sometimes you ask a question about a certain product and you can tell the answer was pulled out of thin air. Brush up on the knowledge of your inventory and this location is set.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 16, 2014~This is the only drive-thru location on my way to work and it is usually pretty busy but they seem to get us through quickly (haven't been late yet!). They are always friendly and quick. Only once did I notice my drink wasn't quite sweet enough but I am kind of a sugar-holic when it comes to coffee. Maybe they were trying to do my pancreas a favor.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 7, 2015~I have been going to this Starbucks constantly because it's close to my house,  but it's become to a state that I need to find another location. The taste of the coffee is not great,  not what's supposed to taste like.  I can't say that the staff is very friendly either.  The place is becoming dirtier and dirtier every time I go.  I decide to let everyone know that I saw a staff removing the trash bag out of the can.  As she was doing that,  she placed the trash lid on top of the cart were sugar and milk sit. LADY,  that's where I put down my coffee,  place my coffee lid down so I can get some sugar and creamer! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? I couldn't believe it,  honestly!!!  Incredible!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 23, 2015~I go to this Starbucks at least 3 times a week, and Jim and my girls Taylor and Melody always take care of me! These girls are great. I don't go anywhere else. Everyone knows me by name and knows exactly how I like my drink. Exceptional customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 21, 2014~I go this Starbucks at least 3 times a week, and Jim and my girls Taylor and Melody always take care of me! These girls are great. I don't go anywhere else. Everyone knows me by name and knows exactly how I like my drink. Exceptional customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jan 28, 2014~I go to this starbucks VERY often.  Most of the time the coffee is perfect. But everytime, the service is amazinf
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 10, 2012~My store. They  know me, I know them. They treat me right. I go through sometimes to buy something as a treat for someone else and I say- make it beautiful it's a gift and they do! Awesome!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 19, 2016~I call this my home Starbucks, the staff is always friendly, helpful for me to start my day! Laura Lucas is the shining star employee that always makes my drinks......
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 23, 2016~I just popped in to get a gift card and on my way out the really sweet employee offered me a water for the road since its 110 degrees. I just thought that was so thoughtful! Well done, Starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Aug 3, 2016~Every time I visit this Starbucks I get a different experience and usually not the best. The staff is very friendly but the drinks are inconsistently made day to day. I could get a caramel macchiato one day and have it made completely differently the next. I've also had several drinks made that the cup wasn't full (and I'm talking there was almost a half of the cup not full). When I pay $7 for a coffee...I'd expect it to be full lol.  All in all, this Starbucks is one of my last choices to visit and I only do if I am in a pinch for time.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jan 26, 2014~Today I just didn't like the chai tea latte...tasted watered down...didn't even drink half if it had to throw it out, just tasted gross
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 23, 2016~Eva was SO rude to me. She acted annoyed when I asked her a question about one of the drinks and I didn't understand why until after I paid. I offered her a coupon for my local business to help cheer her up. She told me `"no, tha business sucks. I used to work there and it is crap.`" Of course I'm advertising my business on my shirt, so now I understand why she was rude to me in the beginning. I told her `"wow... That was really rude. I don't agree with you.`" And she just shrugged and later slammed my drink down almost spilling it.   No idea who she is, but that was so unprofessional. Not going back unless she is gone. Can't believe any company would allow a person like that to work for them.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 27, 2013~The new reduced fat turkey bacon sandwich is TERRIBLE.  Why did you mess with a great thing?  The original with the whole wheat english muffin, egg whites and turkey bacon was so good.  I will never buy the new one again.....and probably will never buy any food items at Starbucks again.  Terrible.  Disappointing.  To add insult to injury, my husband's Veggie Egg sandwich was hard as a rock when we got home.  What a waste of money!  Pay attention to details and understand what your client's want.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jun 23, 2014~Slowing starbucks I have ever been to. Avoid the drive thru at all costs...unless you have a good 10 min. to wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~4~Jun 26, 2024~The service here is always quick, the drinks are made accurately and food is good in a pinch if you need a quick snack or last minute breakfast. This one is more of a quick grab and go location. There is no dining room or lobby to sit and enjoy your coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 23, 2023~This place is drive thru only as their cafe is closed indefinitely. What was extremely disappointing was that all the items I wanted were not available. I ended up ordering something else and what I had was okay, but I would much prefer going to an establishment that actually has their menu items in stock.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 24, 2024~I absolutely hate this Starbucks and try to avoid it at all costs, however it is in the parking lot where I work. It's extremely convenient for me to go to this one since I'm already in the parking lot but tell me how you are never accepting cash?? I show up at this Starbucks between 5:30 and 6:30 and you're not accepting cash?? You're still open that makes absolutely no sense. On top of never accepting cash the staff is rude every time that I go there
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Nov 1, 2023~Zero sense of urgency. There was one other person in front of me in store and it took 15 mins for an iced chai and water. The drive thru is the only thing open on weekends it seems. This location could use a much needed refresh unfortunately. Store is very dirty.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Oct 21, 2023~It is my birthday and I wanted my birthday drink but then I see that the door is locked and it is only 6:40 and they close at 7 if you close at 6:40 please say that on your website!!!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Nov 10, 2023~Don't come to this Starbucks, wait times are 25+ minutes long during non peak times. Got to the register after placing my mobile order ahead of time and the cashier had me repeat my order twice.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 19, 2023~Been to this location and few times and have always had a good experience. Went to the drive thru on 8/19 around 3 PM to order a frozen lemonade that was made incorrectly at another location. The male brown-haired barista working in the drive thru was so nice and he apologized even though he didn't make the first drink, and comped my order. Thank you!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Oct 28, 2021~I was doing a several mile walk to Luke AFB for an event, so I had a chance to try out this SB. I am an SB fan usually giving 4-5 stars but have to give three for this one. I understand they have a junkie, riff raff issue(however I didn't encounter any)but their lesser services as a result detracts from my Starbucks enjoyment.First, there was zero seating available inside or even outside. Second, there's no toilet. Note: After walking 5 miles and taking a short break to walk another 7 miles, I like to SIT DOWN while enjoying my caffeine boost.Third, it's the smallest Starbucks I've ever been in.Staff was ok.Not recommended SB.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 16, 2023~I'm not completely sold on Starbucks but every now and then I decide to give it a try. Do not go to this location unless you're desperate I realize this isn't the best side of town. I'm assuming that's why there's no tables or chairs outside anymore. But the lobby is closed at 1:30 PM on a Saturday. There are only 6 vehicles in front of Me, I have been sitting in line for over 20mins. Having only the drive thru open you would think the associates would have a pretty good system going allowing for the line of cars to stay @ a good flow. I have seen @ least 4 people that are unable to go thru the drive thru try to go inside. I felt bad for the elderly women with a walker that made her way to the door only to find out it was locked. I thought Starbucks was supposed to be a place you could go to relax or meet people for coffee, etc. NOT THIS LOCATION. I am exhausted from working early morning &amp; just wanted to pick me up. I could've definitely taken a nap in the drive-through not to pick me up I was looking for. Again, try to go to any other location if you dare want to try Starbucks. I Have written is review and I'm still waiting for my coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Aug 2, 2023~I can see why this store has a low rating.  I went to this store AGAIN (I don't know why) last Saturday evening and bought a matcha latte and asked for light ice.  Again, my cup was full of ice.  If I'm paying over $7 for a Starbucks drink why is it so hard to put light ice in my cup.  Hell, I'll even pay an exta $.50 cents for this store to get my order right.  I usually frequent 3 different stores and this by far is the most frustrating to go to.  I won't be going to this store anymore.  I mean in the long run Starbucks will still make money regardless if I go to this store or not, but I recommend if you want your drink made correctly you go somewhere else.   Store 5469- You guys have it all wrong.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Jul 19, 2023~When Starbucks employees make a drink, do they read the sticker on the cup? I asked for light ice this morning, and when the employee was handing me my drink, I noticed the cup was full of ice. I politely stated that I asked for light ice. Whoa, did I catch an attitude. I then asked for Splenda and got the same response.  Not sure how any of this was my fault. If I'm paying almost $6 for coffee, I don't think asking for and receiving light ice is asking a lot.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jul 8, 2022~My favorite Starbucks for years. Love the staff,the drinks,their foods are great. I also love their desserts,especially;the lemon cake,amazing.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Mar 26, 2021~My favorite location for years. Johnny the manager, is great,Isaac is also great, as well as Sabrina  &amp; the rest of  the staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Oct 7, 2020~A great staff:Jonny,Isaac,Selena,Devon are awesome. They go above and beyond. Amazing workers &amp; staff
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 2, 2016~Too many transients hanging inside &amp; out.No one Does anything, they sleep at night on tables &amp; do other things. They come in use the bathrooms. They threaten people.Tables should be put in, also people smoke outside there, will not go anymore
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Oct 15, 2016~Awful place, the seating is awful.Transients hang out there constantly all the time &amp; sleep outside on patio tables.  It is awful.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Nov 17, 2023~This drive thru takes so long! They lady couldn't do math either , please hire new people. I love Starbucks but this store puts it to shame
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Dec 26, 2022~I love how people think that Starbucks staff is supposed to do something about `"vagrants`" standing outside the store. What else would you expect from people who pay $8.00 for coffee?I know that they aren't responsible for who's walking outside the store, or inside for that matter. I did have a problem with the manager. Really terrible attitude. Kind of a `"I'm not here to serve you`" and `"Keep it brief`" type. I've just walked away from conversations with him on multiple occasions. Other than that, I'm not crazy about them not having outdoor seating because of the homeless people. Who cares if they sit in their metal chairs for a minute? It's not a neighborhood of homeless people. What about serving the people who come into your store and making our experience like everyone else's?In a Tempe Starbucks I lived by, it was 1/2 homeless and 1/2 people with jobs on laptops, etc. and they still have a whole seating area. The world didn't collapse. It's a bias to the area, not a concern for a potential problem.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Oct 21, 2023~I have never been more disgusted  with humanity as I held my 3 year old grandson that was about to soil himself would be denied a toilet and told us to `"go to El polo loco due to they allow their toilets to be used. There employees are capable of serving the public`".  Goodbye Starbucks. You will never see another penny from us.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Oct 3, 2023~Went to Starbucks this morning to grab a drink and ended up being followed.  The whole staff was amazing especially Alex upfront.  He made sure we were okay and kindly got the guy to leave.  Definitely was a scary morning but felt so comfortable being there.  Will definitely be going back there despite the situation.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jan 8, 2023~I go to Starbucks all the time but I've never been to this location. I just left and the customer service was just outstanding. And the drinks were the best I've had in weeks! Idk the girls name who was working the window but she was just so sweet and super quick. Thank you!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~4~Aug 15, 2020~We ordered mobile once we got to the store. The set up is pretty good and it seemed like drive thru was going pretty quickly. Our mobile order has 8 items and was done early, which was awesome. No outdoor seating set up and you can't order inside currently.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 3, 2023~I don't know why this store has so many bad reviews. The workers are all very friendly, sweet, and remember me. Despite it always being busy, they quickly get things done. Once, I was stuck behind someone in the drive through for about 30 minutes because the customer was unhappy and wanted things remade but the staff handled it well and even gave me my drink for free. I think its a great store and very good staff :)
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Jul 3, 2021~This place would be rated higher if the location was half as efficient as the other Starbucks locations in the area. I've had several instances of ordering an item through the app only to arrive and be told it is sold out. Whether this is down to the app not tracking inventory in real-time like it claims, or some other reason I can't say for sure. I can accept and understand that things happen, but not receiving any kind of notice prior to arrival is kind of annoying.While rare, I have experienced issues with the location closing the inside facility early a couple of times and routing everyone through the drive-thru--That doesn't really work when you walk to the shop because it's just around the corner. That's only happened to me twice, but seems to have happened to other people too.The staff have always been very friendly and polite when I come in. Whether it's just a greeting and giving me my order, or offering solutions when something has been over-sold, and even the occasional employee recommendation to try new stuff on the menu, I've never had a bad experience with the team at this store. The drive-thru is always packed, and they are always very busy, so the fact that they can keep their cool and treat their customers so well is a credit to them all.It's hard to review a coffee shop fairly as we are slowly recovering from a global pandemic, because several of the amenities such as eating indoors, listening to music, or even having sufficient quantities of items are either significantly hampered or outright impossible at the moment. I suspect that, as we get closer to how things used to be, this location may gain a star.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~May 22, 2022~Every time I come here, my drink is always wrong. Today I got a cafe vanilla Frappuccino with caramel and it didn't have any vanilla bean powder in it. Drink still tasted good, but it wasn't what I ordered. What I got was a coffee frapp with caramel, which is cheaper so it just sucks I paid more for a less product.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Apr 30, 2023~Took over 20 minutes to get 1 drink 20 minutes prior closing and the baristas were more concerned about trying to close early than actually making peoples drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 7, 2023~First off , i have never had to write a complaint and i never have on any company because i understand things happen. however, i sat at a empty drive through today for about 5+ minutes. pulled up to the window and sat there for about another 5-8 minutes. again if there was a line and they were handling a lot of orders i get it but there were 4 employees there doing nothing. when i got my drink it was wrong (they gave me sweet cream foam and it was supposed to be just vanilla sweet cream) so the girl took it back and all they did was mix the foam into my drink! at this point im already annoyed and just left.  ive NEVER experienced such laziness from any starbucks ive been to like this. a long wait when there is NO ONE in the drive through or IN THERE STORE and couldnt even FIX MY drink right?! come on man.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 1, 2018~Ive been to a lot of Starbucks' and out of all I would definitely have I say this location was my favorite. I'm not from Arizona but was staying a week in Phoenix and made this location my go to for daily drinks.The employees here great you with a smile which doesn't happen back home in NYC and this location is cleaner than most. However, I would have to agree with what other posters have mentioned about the homeless issue. The tweakers/homeless hangout on the outside patio area and hassle people for change upon exiting the store. I'm used to this but others may not be. This might actually be a problem that's out of Starbucks' control and rather a bigger problem that exists in Arizona.My actual drinks were standard for Starbucks and hit the mark each time I ordered.Beyond that this location is great and I'd suggest you try it out!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jun 12, 2021~I always drive through at this location on my way to the gym. They make a good salted caramel cold brew. Shout out to Daphne who is at the window now she is gorgeous and super friendly !! Starbucks she's a keeper !
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Oct 22, 2021~Wow the management is so much better than the previous months I've been here! Literally got the best service today. I can't explain how grateful I am for the understanding and love the management was! Life changing experience
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Jul 21, 2022~I don't have problem with their drinks because it's good. However, your doors are closed during business hours and you have a sign saying mobile order and drive through. Ok, I did the mobile order and drove here to see the door closed? So what's the point of the mobile order if I have to be in the drive through? Change your business hours on google that way people know it's CLOSED!!!!! I just saw 4 different people were trying to come in and the doors were closed.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jan 26, 2022~Awesome Customer Service ! Driver thru only location .. thanks ladies for the White Mocha :)
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 26, 2022~Update: I took this post down because I felt like it needed edits. Turns out, I still hate this location and it still is `"understaffed`" and `"drive through only`" a year later. The post below was originally written 2021. Whew. Where do we begin? I recently moved to the north-central phx area. I've been here about a year, going on two now. As a consumer, as well as a former `"partner.`" I do feel this post is necessary. I waited awhile to launch any type of formal complaint against this particular location because I like to be as cooperative and understanding as possible, especially during these trying times. On 11/28, I made a phone call during off peak hours to see if management had a minute to discuss general feedback. I spoke with V who is a self proclaimed `"newer addition`" to the team, but still a manager. V informed me that she would be seeing the general manager tomorrow and would promptly inform him of our discussion that outlined a series of unfortunate events: such as the time where this particular location decided to just close in the middle of the day due to staffing issues. No official notice, just a plain piece of paper on the front door with a half-felt `"sorry`" written in pen. Furthermore, I do frequent this location during various hours, which include off and on peak time. No matter what time of day, plan an additional 10 minutes on top of the 15-30 you already set aside in your routine just because lines are always long, there seems to be only 1-2 people working, and the lobby closes around 5. Oh, and if it gets really busy, I guess it's policy just turn off the option to mobile order ahead. I further discussed with V about how being a previous partner. Sometimes I feel the urge to just put on an apron and make my own beverage or even just offer help. V informed me that she would absolutely talk to her boss when she saw him the next morning to further follow up after asking for my name and phone number. I waited for a phone call and didn't really expect one in the morning hours, because again, peak hours. But I finally decided to call the store this afternoon after lunch and ask for the GM myself, R***. I spoke briefly with R*** and asked if by chance V had mentioned anything about our previous conversation. He replied, `"No?`" Surprise. So I asked if he had minute to discuss some general feedback. I illustrated everything already in this post, as well as my previous discussion with V. The whole point of this conversation was for me to gain insight as a consumer as to why this location in particular always seems to be driving the struggle bus, even after a full blown `"renovation.`" Not just for myself, but to also inform others in my circle who have had similar experiences. During my conversation with R***. I mentioned how I was a former partner at Starbucks. For the record, I have also managed other coffee shops. Yet, I still just don't see why this store runs like a three legged cat. Moreover, how I would offer my services but I don't know what I'm actually up against (i.e the alleged high turnover rate and why that i). Obviously there's a common denominator that I guess is non-public info. R*** responded to my feedback with `"right now we're really just trying to do our best, manifest positive vibes, and make moments.`" Which at this point I knew the conversation was over because never in any type of training has it been suggested that one can `"manifest`" that a store will run itself. Shop local.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Sep 6, 2019~American equivalent of Indian udupi kaapi :-) I still remember the first time I had a coffee in a Starbucks outlet back in India...ppl would get into line for hours to have one Starbucks coffee...but here a Starbucks is very common place for a quiet sip of coffee .you can find children working on some assignment and people having coffee and cookies crunching .I love this outlet a lot and their beverages are really good .it's not as overpriced as back in India and definitely worth a try
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 5, 2022~These folks are so rude! I get your located in a bad neighborhood, but don't make us patrons suffer. At least have it locked if needed for paying customers! This is ridiculous.... there is no need to be rude to your customers that are paying for coffee. Refund me since you don't care about your customers!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jul 10, 2019~Please take this as constructive criticism. For two weeks straight, 10 days in a row, I order your nitro cold brew. Not because I thoroughly enjoy it, but because your regular cold brew is pretty much just water. Sadly, you're the only Starbucks near my home, so I hadn't complained until now. For 10 straight days, several different window employees, I ask for many pumps of classic and milk in my nitro brews and I always get the drink without milk and without classic. Now, I have to taste the drink once handed to me to ensure I get what I ordered, and without fail, it's not. Do you own up to your mistakes? Of course not, your employees always give me attitude and give me this awkward stare as I explain to them what's missing in my drink. This mistake causes your employees, myself, and the long line of cars behind me to waste more time, as you `"fix`" my order. I placed fix under quotation marks, because it's just bearable to drink and I need to wake up.So...who's fault is it? Management. This is a training issue on two fronts: 1) Customer service and 2) Standards of production (essentially how to make coffee). Please use this review to better your practices and I will make a revision in due time.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Apr 6, 2019~Excellent Starbucks. They were out of my normal Green tea latte (at least that is what the app told me) I ordered something else and a tall dark roast for my friend. When I got inside they told me they didn't have dark roast right now but she offered to add a shot to pike roast for me and it was amazing. I really appreciate the staff was very friendly and helpful and now we have a new drink that is delicious!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Apr 23, 2017~5 Stars for SUPERB customer service. Justin was working the drive-thru window yesterday when we gave him a huge order. He got it right but what amazed my fam and I is how attentive and professionally courteous he was. Seriously, no joke, his customer service was THE best I've ever encountered. He should be an executive at some resort because that's how great he was. Definitely worthy of a promotion. Thanks for making our day!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 25, 2022~This Starbucks is very clean and they care about their customers.  I went through the drive thru and got a Mango Dragon fruit refresher told them I have breast cancer got up to window and there was no charge. Touched my heart. Thank you kind Starbucks love your company only place I get my drinks you deserve a Pat on back will be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 18, 2021~Sandra helped me in the drive thru today and I just want to say she was so pleasant and cheerful it was pretty busy but didn't seem to effect her at all, definitely love when there is this kind of customer service around still! Will definitely keep coming to this Starbucks, keep up the awesome job!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Mar 9, 2021~Today I made a mobile order and came through the drive through and let me just say the workers were so rude. Went I came through they sounded disgusted that I was in their space and when I got my drink they did not include the whip cream that I ordered on top. So I asked kindly if I could get that included, since I put it in my order, and the guy took my drink, rolled his eyes, said something under his breath, and grudgingly returned with the drink. I understand everyone has a tough day but in customer service you have to keep going. Sad to say this location was really a disappointment and won't be coming back.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Mar 9, 2021~I've been to this location multiple times and let me say it's the croissants and NICOLE ! Nicole always a vibrant smiling voice behind the mic and mask! Her spirit radiates with every order she places! There's mornings where she's not prepared for success when the menu is updated with new drinks but the ingredients haven't come in yet, but she pushes threw lol she will always always explain and help create or find something similar. It's very rare that I've ever felt included at this establishment or had a joyful experience but as long as croissants and Nicole are at this location I will forever be a customer. Nicole, thank you for being the light during some of the darkest days!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Sep 25, 2019~These guys are probably the best employees of Starbucks I have come face to face with. Some not the best but I give high five for the ones who care about getting our drinks made right. Thank you to Miriam, Michelle, Andrea our night shift crew. For the mistake of an employee I got a free drink and was able to pay for someone's meal who waited patiently. Thank you for our good doing so I can do my good doing.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 30, 2020~STORE MANAGER TALKS SH**I have been to this starbucks about 1-3 times a week for 8 months. Half the time they get my drink right depending on the people working and if they know me but that's never enough for me to write a bad review. I order my usual, an iced coffee with caramel drizzle in it. Since the environmentally friendly lids came along, I try to drink my coffee but the caramel just sits at the bottom and I can't taste it at all so I like to use a straw. I ask `"hey sorry but can I get a straw`" I get a dumbfounded look and for a minute I didn't think he was going to give me one. Then as i'm waiting he finally scoffs and says `"God, I swear you arizonans don't like saving the turtles`" I was speechless and wanted to make comments like `"you know recycling exists`" but nothing would come out. I took my straw and he scoffs again saying have a good day and shuts the window. This was totally unlike this starbucks and coming from him because I know he's the store manager but I've had enough of this place. Again half the time the drinks are wrong or I get priced differently depending on workers and now attitude?
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jun 22, 2021~Kevin and Isaac are literally the backbone of this location, they are always so friendly, and I wouldn't come back if it wasn't for them. I come through this drive through 2-3 times a week, and they get ish done. Fastest drive through line ever. Favorite Starbucks ever.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 24, 2018~This place was busy as usual. No matter when I go the baristas are always nice and friendly, usually having good conversation with me. My order is alway done right. When I order I go and wait at an empty table for my name to be called, instead of waiting at the hand off area.  An iced coffee spilled and they barely moved out of the way for the guy cleaning up. They replaced the spilled on food without any one asking for it to be replaced. I go to the art studio across the across the street, going to starbucks before doing my art is alway my favorite.  I usually bring my own cup and they never forget my cup discount (which honestly is not a big, but it's nice to get). Keep it up baristas, good job.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~May 20, 2022~This is my favorite Starbucks cause all drinks are made very good and it's on my way to work,  but there's this one person (keven)  that always looks and sounds like he's in a bad mood!  I Always say please and thank you and he never says anything back. Just hands me the drink with an attitude and shuts the window!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Dec 20, 2018~Well damn I know why the 2.5 stars . Yeah the customer service I got today from Josh was not the best . He sure gave the person in front of me and the guy behind me great service. Looks like this Starbucks lost my money .
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Apr 2, 2022~Cici was so nice! This is my first time to this location and she was the best Starbucks employee I've met.... And I go to Starbucks everyday!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 21, 2018~I am so disappointed in this Starbucks. I took my 4 year old son to the bathroom and we were in there for all of 2 minutes. We mistakenly went into the men's bathroom but it was for my son so technically it was still the correct bathroom for him. While he's on the toilet we get a loud banging on the door from an employee saying to open up the door. I said loudly that it was busy but the employee replied `"well we have someone waiting out here!`" Then I shouted back that my son was still using the bathroom. When we exited, there was an angry customer waiting to walk right in. It seems Starbucks as a whole has an issue with their bathrooms and clearly they didn't learn anything from the day they took off in May. There was nothing wrong with my son using the single Men's bathroom. Get it together Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 14, 2022~This Starbucks is close to my house but went there for the first (and last time) a few days ago. There were about 7 cars in the drive they before me, but it seemed to move quickly. The weather is nice so with my windows down I proceeded to the drive up with a friend to place my order- that's when the bees started swarming around my car. I was speaking into the microphone when they began to come in my window!!  I said oh my Gosh! There are bees coming in my car as I quickly rolled the window up and the employee on the other end said  `"I know, but their friendly bees!`" It took me several minutes to place the order as I had to keep rolling my window up and down continuously so I didn't get stung and  have bees in my car (my small Shitzu was with me as well, and she was not liking the bees much to say the least). As I VERY SLOWLY made my way to the window, with my windows up, I discovered as soon as I tried to hand over my phone (I have the Starbucks app) for her to scan (she had the scanner in her hand) that the bees were worse there!!  I had to practically throw my phone so I could pay and not be stung as I could not leave that window down for more than 1/2 second and only a crack,  it was impossible to get my drink because the bees were everywhere and trying to get in my car, sting me, and gene really just swarm all around the window.  showing her annoyance with me, the Starbucks employee suggested while throwing my phone back to me, that I just pull up to the front of the store. With still no drink yet, I  pulled up, incredulous that this was even happening!  I sat in my car waiting for someone to come out and bring me my coffee and after close to 10 minutes I realized that no one was coming! Livid,I went inside, saw the same girl taking orders  as though she had completely forgotten about me; livid and yelling over everyone standing there I yelled `"excuse me! You might have told me that I had to come inside to get my order rather than have me sit outside waiting!`" She looked up and told me that I hadn't paid!! I reminded her that I had handed her my phone to scan; and she had  the scanner, why had she not done the scan??  I stormed back to my car to get my wallet and pay and get the heck out of there, when another employee came out with my drink. I was livid and proceeded to tell her that this was the worst Starbucks experience ever  and she (wisely) chose to do the only positive customer service display I had experienced in the grueling 30 minutes i had spent there!  I won't ever return, free drink or not - absolutely horrible!! Starbucks  doesn't want to be associated with this location.  And watch out for the bees!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Jun 13, 2018~Good location and drinks....unclean restrooms!!!Nothing turns me off than messy and unclean restrooms!! Makes you wonder how clean the rest of the business is kept.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Feb 23, 2020~I've never had such great customer service as I did this morning, both the drive thru attendant and Kevin at the check out were great! I go to Starbucks everyday and this has been the first time in a long time that I was provided with excellent customer service! Thank you Kevin and the other gentleman who took my drink order!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Aug 28, 2017~Although chains like Starbucks should, in theory, exhibit comparable service and quality, this was not my experience today.I ordered a vanilla sweet cream coldbrew. It was okay. Not great, but it would get the job done. I would have given it 3 stars had it not been for the Barista.  Maybe he was just having a bad day, but I was surprised at just how unfriendly he managed to be during our very brief interaction. While the woman who took my order was perfectly nice, the kid working the drive-thru cash register seemed genuinely inconvenienced customers were there at all. I get it, some days maybe you just don't feel like coming into work and dealing with people, but you don't need to take it out on customers. I would think twice before returning to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Mar 12, 2017~Waking in to the Starbucks there was no line which was awesome. Had to use the restroom and it was a big surprise. This has have to be the dirtiest Starbucks I have ever been too. The bathroom had some stuff all over the sink that looked like throw up but I wasn't sure nor was I going to find out. We got our drinks and sat at a table but we had to clean it. Unfortunately there were no napkins on the table and it seemed like the trash has not been thrown out for hours. Everything was over filling. The people working were very nice and the drinks were good but because of how dirty this Starbucks actually is I don't think I will be coming back because I'm not sure how clean they keep the actual machines.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Sep 24, 2021~This location closes whenever it wants to. Whether that be in store, drive thru or both. I know this seems petty but at the very least the app should notify if that is the case. This location is on my way to work and I always do a mobile order and pick up inside so that I can get to work on time. When it is randomly closed, and I already have paid for my items it puts me in a very frustrating position. I'm not going to speak on quality bc it is hit or miss just like every Starbucks, I don't find the employees very friendly. Again like most locations. But the inconsistency in the stores availability randomly without warning is not right. I tried to call the store no one answers. I know my business or my lack of business makes no difference to anyone but honestly unless you are doing nothing for the day but getting Starbucks, go somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Jun 11, 2019~Again another Starbucks that the employees and owners don't care about cleanliness.  This place was a mess.  The bathroom hadn't been cleaned in awhile. You didn't want to touch anything worried you pick up some kind of virus.  Order a simple cold brew with sweet cream and it took them 15min to make it while everyone that ordered behind me (hot drinks and cold) got theirs before me.  I am a pretty patient person but when someone gets backed up you'd think the people standing around talking would help out especially if the person getting behind is new.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jan 28, 2017~Staff was awful. Slow service and mean to customers, wrong drink orders.I waited for my drink for over 25 minutes but was too scared to ask about it because a lady in front of me very politely asked about a drink she had been waiting for for 20 minutes and got yelled at, pretty badly by what seemed to be a supervisor. Just go to a different location!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Nov 30, 2019~The guy taking orders kept repeating how stressed out he was and complaining about other emoyees asking him questions while he was working....`"Hey in case you did know... You work at Starbucks which is a very busy coffee place.`"Dont complain about your job while you work.  If you cant handle it, work somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Aug 25, 2016~Sorry to say that this location has declined appreciably since my last review. Customer service is very hit &amp; miss. Cleanliness has deteriorated.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jun 2, 2016~Brand new location. Replaced the old location in the Albertson's shopping center at 19th Ave &amp; Northern. Good parking, easy access and drive thru. Customer service was good, but most are at the beginning. Will have to see how things progress with time, but for now, A okay.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Mar 23, 2020~If it was to me I would rate this experience ZERO STARS. The employee who took my order not only treated me very poorly, he didn't say hi when I walked up to the window, instead he said `"here, here, here`" with bad attitude while handing me the drink and through all of this I kept being cordial, understanding there was a line of cars in the back.  I noticed my ordered was wrong so I politely asked to have my order remade as I made my way through the drive-thru again.  Then at the window again, the order is wrong again and this specific employee leaves me waiting at the window while him and his coworkers have a little fun chat, he ALSO tells me he doesn't know why the order it's wrong because he didn't make it.  He starts arguing with me on how I should order to save money with a HORRIBLE ATTITUDE.  This guy definitely doesn't have customer service skills.  I was so fed up with his attitude, I just left because now I can't trust the whole team from that location to make my drinks.  I threw  away both of the drinks because I was so unsatisfied with my drinks and the attitude certainly did not help . He was absurdly disrespectful.  I should've asked for my money back but I really didn't want to spend more time there dealing with this guy.  He also covered his name because he knew he messed up. He seemed like an older looking bald, bluesh, greenedh eyes, short beard, wears eyeglasses. I've been a loyal starbucks customer for over 15 years and NEVER BEFORE been treated this poorly. As a matter of fact, I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED LIKE AT ANY OTHER COMPANY AT ALL this as poorly as this person treated me!Seriously!! From reading all reviews I guess I'm not the only person that has had this awful experience at this location!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Apr 3, 2019~Went in to this Starbucks over the weekend with Harvey.  I waited outside in the patio area with Bruno, our dog while he got coffee and tea for us.  It was great as usual.  While we were just enjoying our beverages outside Michelle(one of the baristas) came up and said hi to us and our dog.  Bruno is usually extremely shy around new people but he loved Michelle and opened right up to her.  She even brought Bruno out a puppychino which was super nice and kind.  Michelle is an amazing person.  Thank you for making our weekend.  Michelle, Harvey and Bruno.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jul 13, 2018~This is got to be one of the worst Starbucks ever! This is the second time they didn't make my coffee when ordering through the mobile app! What's the point of ordering ahead of time if I don't get what I'm ordering?!?! This is ridiculous. Today the ladies were just standing in the back and didn't even acknowledge me at all!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 12, 2020~Customer service in the drive thru was very poor. I repeated my order many times to where I was screaming at the intercom. The person helping me kept getting the order wrong in the intercom and proceeded to say, `"I don't know what you want.`" By then I had just given up.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Nov 8, 2018~Not the best atmosphere to enJOY your drink. The homeless are abundant there. They had to remove the outside couch because the cops were called late one Thursday night two weeks ago. I'm sorry I do NOT agree with their open door policy. There are times I've come in, and there's NO place to sit. One guy had ALL his possessions spread all over the table. Another homeless guy smelled so bad you didn't WANT to sit at his table.AND, to top it off, there was one homeless guy waiting to use the restroom for OVER 30 minutes. The baristas kept knocking on the door but the guy inside wouldn't come out!!! When we finally were leaving, the guy came outta the restroom. The other homeless guy finally went in. It was the WORST experience I have EVER had at a Starbucks! SOMETHING needs to change!I am sitting outside there now. A homeless guy is ranting &amp; ranting, talking to himself as he SMOKES a cigarette. No one is coming out to stop his smoking or ranting. I can't get up &amp; go in to complain because he will know it was me. I AM sympathetic to them, I understand some need help. WHY don't they get help?! If I were you, I'd find another location.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Apr 10, 2018~The worst starbucks i have ever been too. Waited 40+ minutes for one drink and sandwich. Finally asked an associate what was taking so long. She just shrugged her shoulders and said their really busy. Come to find out they lost my drink and food in the midst of the khaos and didnt care. Horrible customer service. I got my money back and would not recommend anyone to go there.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~4~Dec 4, 2019~Coffees are the best here .The house coffee and the egg Nog latte are some.of which I have tried and liked .You find people from all walks of life .Students ,people on date ,friends meeting up etc all enjoying and sipping their sip of coffee in Starbucks usually .The Starbucks app lets you collect stars when you upload receipts for points n rewards
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Mar 4, 2021~It has been my THIRD time here at this Starbucks location, and I have been here 3 different times of the day and they NEVER have sufficient ingredients for our drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Dec 21, 2018~The customer service is always great every time I visit this location. Always greeted warmly when I walk through the door. I am able to order and receive my purchase in a timely fashion. The other day when I went, I liked how the barista inquired if I would like to have the brownie I ordered warmed up, it's the little things like that that really make a great customer service moment. Thank you for all that you do Starbucks on Northern and I hope you continue!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Dec 1, 2017~Always great coffee and plenty of space to do school work or website work for my salon.  Fresh hot coffee and delicious healthy snacks always.  Breakfast, lunch or dinner here and I'm content.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 17, 2020~I wanted a nitro cold brew with sweet cream Iced the cashier insisted on telling me how it comes it doesn't come this way or that way ,all I wanted was ice ! People go through Starbucks asking for 2 pumps of this ,this type of milk bla bla bla and I can't ask for my drink iced and the cashier keeps telling me how it comes everyone modifies their drinks it's Starbucks ! And apparently I can't ask for ice I came home and put my own ice but wow
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jul 5, 2020~I don't know if this place got new management but keep up the good work! I came by today and Elena's help was excellent. Thank you! Will come by again.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Jun 20, 2018~This place has the potential to be a great coffee shop. Actual, the coffee was decent. But they have a deceitfully advertised closing time posted on their website and right on the front glass near the entrance. Both say `"10:30pm`".  But I was asked to leave the premises at 9:30, an hour before the clearly posted closing time of `"10:30pm.`"  As a matter of fact as I sat outside finishing my coffee, 3 other potential customers attempted to enter but were equally surprised at the premature closed Starbucks.  They felt deceived as well.  This was very upsetting. The management needs to specify the proper closing time in the appropriate places so not to further deceive and upset potential customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~4~Jun 18, 2017~This is the Starbucks I go to often.  I like the staff.  They never seem to be flustered when I pay with my phone app.  Best of all they give me a mighty fine cup of coffee when I need it most.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Feb 4, 2020~Every time I come to this location they're out of product and they always suggest me drinks that are nothing like what i originally had asked for. Today I went and got a drink from a young man named Roman and he got rude with me while I was ordering and if it weren't for there being people infront of an behind me I wouldn't have ordered anything. Sad thing is I literally live off 19th ave an Northern and am a regular at this location but dealing with the bad attitudes and customer service isn't worth it. I might start spending my money at Dutch bros instead.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jun 22, 2018~I've only been to this location a couple times, but every time I'm there it's great. The Baristas are wonderful and will have a conversation with me. They're always smiley, laughing with each other, which is great to find positive people in the morning. The line for the drive through is always around the block and the parking lot is hard to maneuver for that reason. Inside I've never seen it too busy, so a typical stop before work is about ten minutes.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Sep 4, 2016~We visited this new Starbucks on Northern Avenue and the floor was dirty the windows were dirty. The service was good and the product was good.  We just thought it should've been a little more clean. Just because it's in a bad area doesn't mean the store has to reflect that.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 10, 2019~I've been to this location over a year now because is the closest to my home but this year they hired a barista. White man middle age with glasses and tattoos who never fails to give me the worst customer service. I've been to too many Starbucks locations before and I know exactly what to order but this guy is unbelievable rude. I stopped coming here because he always messes up my order and never apologizes. I came back today because I figured maybe he wasn't working there anymore. Nope. Couldn't get my order right again, seems to have a problem with anyone who's not white.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Nov 21, 2017~I go here because it's a walking distance from my job. I order by mobile  so when I get there I can just pick it up and eat at my job. However, this is the THIRD time they get my order wrong. I always order a spicy chorizo sandwich with NO CHEESE and they always have it with cheese. It's annoying that I order to just pick it up and end up having to wait because they can't read a label that states NO CHEESE. You would think they would apologize or give me a gift card to compensate but nope! Another time I had ordered a blonde coffee and I waited for about half an hour because they did tell me it would take a few minutes but I didn't imagine it would take half an hour. I go and ask them if it's almost ready just for them to tell me they hadn't even started it yet. Overall they have very slow service and their drinks are either too strong or flavorless.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Apr 20, 2018~I ordered a grande iced coffee with a warmed cheese danish .... I get to the drive through window and pay with my Starbucks app .... the girl hands me my iced coffee and starts grabbing other drinks for the next people ... I ask her where's my cheese danish and she says we didn't charge you for it so I say it's fine and drive off ... and then I look on my app after leaving to see what they charged me and they did charge me for the cheese danish...  Thanks for over charging me ....
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Oct 13, 2019~I'm a simple grande iced caramel macchiato girl! I went into Starbucks today and my coffee was WAY too sweet. My friend asked politely if he can remake it because the drink was too sweet. The barista looks and him like my friend is dumb and said that's how it's supposed to be. He asked again if they can just re-do it and the barista said `"I can charge you 99 cents for an extra shot`" I rather go to another coffee shop and pay again for something better. Right after that a lady had came back up and was a bit up set cause she had asked for light ice and the drink was like half way full. The guys again was like `"that's how the drink is`" People don't pay over $5 for coffee to not be the way they want it. I go to many other Starbucks locations, and when I have a drink problem, it's fixed right away with the best attitude and they're so generous. I hope this does not continue. Sadly I will not be coming back to this Starbucks. Management please work on costumer service. Thank you!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Sep 13, 2019~Trash!!! Slowest Starbucks I've ever been too and all the staff in here does is mess around!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 29, 2016~I've visited three times in the last week. I've discovered that the less busy the location is, the slower the service. I just waited ten minutes for one drink, and I was the only car in the drive thru, and there were only a couple of people in the parking lot. I wanted to leave, but had already paid. They definitely got that done quickly...
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 15, 2016~I went last Saturday before an appt. . I waited 20 minutes with just 6 cars in front of me. I ordered a Strawberry and creme. It had no flavor at all.  I was excited when I saw them building it near my home. But if I go back I will go in for faster service and to let them know what happened before.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 1, 2019~I ordered a cold brew with cascara cold foam. It tasted like a regular iced coffee( it wasn't smooth) and the cold foam was not airy and sweet. It tasted like an iced coffee with cream. I did not enjoy it. I was already on the freeway and unable to turn around to get a replacement. Disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 23, 2016~Horrible service.... Went here and they made my drink wrong. When I went back to have them fix it. They proceeded to tell me it's not there problem... I go to Starbucks 5/7 days out of the week and never had this horrible of customer service! Go the extra mile up the road and go to that Starbucks...
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jul 11, 2016~Slowest Starbucks on the planet. Seriously how long does it take to make a pre made iced coffee? Sigh.....
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 6, 2019~coffee was great but when I went for the $3 frapp Roman was SOOOO rude to my deaf cousin. I asked him to just have patience with him and Roman continued just being so rude to this poor 10 year old. The kid obviously can't hear perfectly and roman clearly saw he had hearing aids and was struggling and was just so mean and I will never go to that one again.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 17, 2018~Prepare to wait that the Starbucks. If you go in they do not put anything in order drive-through comes 1st period iced drinks take the longest for some unknown reason. Not a good Starbucks in the area.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~May 17, 2019~Never going to this Starbucks again because they don't give what you ask. I worked with Starbucks and quit about 2 months ago, but I get the Matcha Green Tea Latte Iced. One time I asked for this drink in a Venti size and I asked for Light Ice and Carmel Drizzle with Vanilla Syrup (Really Good)... they didn't give me light ice and they didn't give me a drizzle, only a swirl on top and they charged me. The second time I asked for the same thing and they didn't give me light ice and they didn't add vanilla... oh and they left an inch of space... I'm I didn't say less product, I said less ice. Smfh they don't listen and light ice makes a difference, I don't want my drink watered down!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Nov 13, 2016~Quick, clean, and crafted beautifully with a smile.I was greeted warmly, my name was placed on the cup for verification and was handed to me with a `"thank you`". The store was decorated with holiday cheer, and is managed well. I will return to this store.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Mar 8, 2018~I stopped at this Starbucks location (drive-thru) on my way to work and ordered a coffee and a pumpkin loaf. When I arrived at work, I discovered that the plastic bag that the pumpkin loaf was in, had a gaping hole that clearly had been there for awhile because the loaf was completely stale. DISGUSTING!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Apr 22, 2018~I usually have great service at this location. The cashier Robby was extremely rude.you think with all the problems going on with Starbucks they would be a little more friendly!!! But not this one look like Robbie was having a bad day so she took it out in the customer !   Will not be back !!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 20, 2017~This place is filthy there is spilled coffee on the floor and papers on the floor and table. The outside is just as bad.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Mar 12, 2018~One of the best Starbucks I have been to. One of the baristas, I think his name was Ben is super helpful, courteous and shows interest in the customer. I'm not from the area but he knew all of the regulars' drink orders. Very knowledgeable and super polite.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 6, 2018~Great service and nice atmosphere. People don't seem to make decaff anymore.  So for my half decaf half regular, they made the decaf Americano style. That was very nice
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~May 13, 2017~I am surprised this location has such bad reviews. I've had nothing but great service here, very quick. I come 3-4 times a week for coffee &amp; teas. I usually order through the mobile app 10 mins before so it's ready soon as I get there, which I recommend if you are in a hurry. They are clean, friendly, and super bubbly in the morning lol I love it here. Especially Chenin, she always makes my custom drink on point! Thanks guys!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 11, 2019~if i could give it no stars i would . very slow services with a very long line , in store and drive thru . No napkins , place is dirty . rude employees
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Nov 18, 2019~On Saturday morning the 16th of November around 11 am​, I went into this Starbuck​s with 5 of my friends. I ordered my drink first and all 5 of my friends ended up receiving​ their order before me. I asked the barista (middle-aged man with long hair and glasses) when my drink was coming out. I ordered a peppermint white chocolate mocha frappucino and he handed me a pumpkin spice frappucino. I told him the order was wrong and he rudely said would make me another one. I finally got my drink and dropped it when I got outside. Instead of asking for another one, I just purchased it again. I waited for my drink for 20 minutes or so and had to ask about it​ ​again. I was handed ANOTHER pumpkin spice frappucino. I told them my order was wrong again. A girl with brown hair made me another one and ended up giving me a vanilla bean frap with peppermint. There was no coffee in the drink whatsover. I spent a total of 45 minutes waiting for my drinks and they were not apologetic for making my drink wrong 3x. I did not even say anything about them making me a vanilla bean with peppermint instead of a white chocolate peppermint mocha because I was so fed up with being at that starbucks for so long and being treated rudely for telling them they made my drink wrong. I will NEVER be going to that location at Starbucks, especially because of the middle-aged​ man with long hair and glasses. He was the rudest of them all!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Sep 3, 2016~The worst Starbucks I've ever been too. Customer service sucks and it always takes 15-20 minutes to get a damn coffee. I absolutely hate this Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Sep 11, 2016~I have the Starbucks App. and I always place my order at least 10 minutes in advance. I've now had several instances where I walk in and my drink is not ready and the ticket is still sitting at the printer. The latest example of this was today where there weren't any vehicles at the drive thru nor waiting to order. Management - make some improvements!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Sep 23, 2017~would be nice when I come in with my daughter to not have to ask 10 minutes after we order and everyone else has received drinks (other people ordering after we have) to not have to ask and then have her drink made well after we paid and others have been served. In addition not being able to speak to a manager or receive a call back because `"they are slammed`" this time when I decided after this and all of the other time I had had enough. well its been a day now and still no manager call to at the least say they are sorry. I will never go to that location again, I hope then receive the same disservice when they are treating their loved ones to coffee
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Sep 19, 2017~I have given up on Starbucks...well at least I did untill I found this gem of a starbucks! Last time I had Starbucks it tasted like it was made with melted plastic instead of soy milk like I'd asked for And I vowed to never go back..it's been about 6 long starbuckless months and lately on my drives out towards the 51 freeway I'm so tired I find that a fast food coffee and energy drink together still didn't do the trick so I buckled and stopped at THIS STARBUCKS..went through the drive thru ave ordered my coffee (venti caramel frappe extra caramel and extra shot) at the window I was greeted by the sweetest girl named mikah she wasnt snotty like most baristas jaded by the drive thru position in fact we shared a laugh wich was nice! I tasted my coffee before I left and it was the best coffee i think I've ever had it wasn't too strong but def woke me up and I had the uplift from a 30 sec convo with this barista (I can't even remember what we laughed at).. I'm making this and only this Starbucks my new spot!! Ty mikah for unknowingly bringing my mermaid tail back to me!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Mar 5, 2018~This place was known for its service but these days in the evening the service has turned horrible.I stood at  kiosk and waited for the barista,Nobody addresses me forever.They hardly care when i left the kiosk.This place used to be my favorite places but not anymore.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jul 28, 2016~I've gone here about 10 times now since it's so close by my job. Oh my gosh!!! The customer service just keeps getting worse and worse. They are so slow it's ridiculous. I mean this place is the worst!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~4~Jun 25, 2017~When I first started going here, service was very slow in the drive-thru. Things have sped up considerably though, and everyone there is very pleasant. They know me on a first hand basis now. lol
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 28, 2016~This has got to be the slowest Starbucks known to man.  I am currently sitting in the drive thru line and have now been here 10 mins.  I don't know if its the staff, the customers, or a combination of the 2.  I have received 2 free drinks here in the past several weeks because of how slow they are.  Just a tip to management...get your act together, you are making the brand look bad.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Feb 3, 2017~Mixed review, depending on shift. Loud, careless staff. One nazi-like marine kid who slams things around and thinks he is the city's answer to the homeless problem in the area, but just makes things worse at the expense of service to the rest of us. Think D-day, only they are bringing lattes instead of guns. It just doesn't work. He's not the only one. LOUD staff, slamming things around. Task focused, instead of customer focused, behavior and lack of manners. Just corporate trons. Don't send your kids here. Get your yuppieness to McDonald's coffee down the street.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~1 year ago~Service is good, employees are very nice. The coffee is pretty bad, been here 3 times and I regret it every time.I go here because the other Starbucks in the metro circle has a long line every time I go but I think I'll keep going to the metro one and wait for my drink to be made right. The coffee is too strong and bitter and I like my coffee really dark. Today my drink has what looks like little milk curds, smh.Train your baristas or have them taste test their coffee because it's pretty bad.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~Oct 23, 2024~43th Ave and &amp; Dunlap/OliveCame in for the `"Medicine Ball`" never had it before and had a cold and a friend told me to go get one.  Well got home, while I was drinking it it had like chunks or something.  Turns out the bag was torn open, and didn't realize.  Service, always super great.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Nov 10, 2022~They took FOREVER to make 2 drinks. At least 15 minutes I was in line with only 2 cars in front of me. Terrible service.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~May 22, 2024~Terrible place of establishment. Waste of time and the worst customer service alive to human kind. 0 stars
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Jul 22, 2024~Idk why I see bad reviews maybe because it's a smaller shop but honestly the staff is super nice an never messes up my order unlike a lot of other shops so I get that it takes time to do it right some people just impatient
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jan 30, 2024~Really tried to love this location but I've received many nasty bitter drinks from here. Not worth returning, I rather support a local business...sorry Starbies! The service is okay but the drinks are horrible. Small location, cannot study here as it's only has a walk up window and drive through.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Apr 11, 2023~States they're open until 9pm, but when you show up at 8:40 the employees tell you they're closing early (with NO posted signage or indication other than a TRASH CAN blocking the drive through). Will be calling to complain tomorrow to the store manager as that's completely unprofessional.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Mar 14, 2024~I pay for extra for the foam, and that's all I got. Thought it was a one time thing, but it happens every time I order. It's only an issue for this location too. Every other location actually gives you what you pay for.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Oct 27, 2023~I do not recommend this Starbucks. They are disorganized and lazy. I placed a mobile order about  15 minutes ahead of the time I'd be there and it was still not ready. I pulled up and it was not busy so i thought my drink would be ready and the barista told me they where still working on my iced coffee. I did not end up getting my drink because I had go to work. It was ridiculous that it takes them 30 minutes to make a coffee! It shows me that the employees are lazy and their management is WEAK! WORST LOCATION EVER.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jan 23, 2024~The manager there her name is Gabby. I placed an order through DoorDash for an iced coffee. My order came with a hot coffee so I contacted DoorDash. I figured it was the Dashers fault. They made the order and sent it out again the second time came out hot again with Hair inside. My drink so I knew it was DoorDash his fault so I called direct to the Starbucks and asked to speak to the lady who made my drink. When I spoke to her she kept saying that she put ice and she made that drink personally and that there was ice, but there was not the drink was hot even the Dasher scene because there was no ice. I opened it up in front of the Dasher the second time to make so I told her you are doing this on purpose. She kept persisting that I'm lying so then I spoke to another manager and explained to her and asked, why are they doing this and if I could come in and rehab my order made or get a refund they kept saying that basically I'm lying so I said I'm gonna come through the drive-through myself with the two hot coffees and let you see for yourself because there is no ice and that there is hair in there. She basically said that even if I bring the drinks in that I'm still lying so don't ever order from the store. It's horrible the manager her name is Gabby. She is horrible. I am going to call corporate.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~1 year ago~Horrible service, location is the biggest headache to access, and their quality is worse than week old 7/11 coffee. Messed up a coffee order and then wouldn't fix it when asked. Much respect to the employees in food service but be warned this place is the worst Starbucks in PHX, AZ, United States.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jun 2, 2023~First time at this location and It took me 30 minutes to get through the drive through, Terrible! Starbucks Corp needs to fix this, so many bad reviews about the wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~4~Sep 1, 2023~The service is fabulous, they remember my order, &amp; my name.  I'm at home here,  It's a pick up location, no inside service but the employees have enthusiasm.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Nov 17, 2022~It was my birthday today and I never received the birthday gift on my app, even though I've had my account since forever. Usually they'll still give you a birthday drink if you're able to provide proof, and I had more than enough proof. Yet, they still refused to give me a birthday drink. Go to another Starbucks, they'll treat you better.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Aug 17, 2023~One of my favorite Starbucks, and mainly just because the employees! Thank you everyone at this store for showing up and doing your best in a world full of un-appreciative people
Phoenix, AZ 85051~3~Jul 4, 2023~This Starbucks sucks. Like bad. There `"walkup`" window is terrible. It's either broken, the wait is `"20-30 minutes`" or they mess up your order. However, given the area it makes sense
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jul 22, 2023~Why does this location have to be the convenient one by my house. They mess up every single mobile order. They just can't get it together. What a shame. Today they Served me a cold sandwich that is supposed to be warm. When I ask for a new one they purposely burnt the sandwich. When I returned and ask for my money back there were no apologies (you could tell on her face she did it on purpose.)
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Jun 23, 2022~Im not sure if thr is the right starbucks on  4265 W Dunlap Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85051. This is my first time writing a starbucks review, but I just had to because these two ladies were amazing.Right now starbucks is have 50%off any drink, and for some reason it was working. Isjah the one who took my order was trying to figure it out, but when she couldn't she asked Danielle for assistance. Can just say I don't know if Danielle a Manger, but she handled that situation like a boss. Let's just say I left very happy and satisfied. Thanks again ladies.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Sep 20, 2022~The `"supervisor `" during the evening shift is very rude to customers, and when you have a concern he will close the window on your face. Employees are nice tho.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Mar 26, 2023~Another COVID19 failure of what was said to be the Best Customer Service In the coffee industry. Well Failure occurred when I drove to the closest a d not best rated (1.6 miles away..on Peoria)So I proceeded to place my orderTWO Trinty Iced CoffeeWith Whip, Extra Cream, Extra Sugar and Carmel DrizzleInquired about bagels...they had one left... Should have left it there....sad little thing. But ordered the Pumpkin bread for the wife. Got to the window, and total was $10.45 and said... Hmm  we have a problem.They handed one coffee (missing Carmel and Whip)Then handed 2 bags luke warm and proceed to say `"Have a nice Day`" smiling and I said we are missing a drink.. To her surprise she says..`"I only see 1`", hmm well the first thing on the list was TWO Trintie Iced Coffees... So she recovers and says lt me get started on that. Another woman comes to the window and say.. Sir it will be $4.98: I commented for a drink ahe forgot. She says yeah....I say here you go...She scanned my phone App and I drove on.Now 24 hours ago....Exactly The same situation occurred and they made my missing drink and said ..`"Have a great  day, apologies for missing your second coffee . Bill was $10.98.Time to drive for the service
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~1 year ago~I don't know why they hire people that don't know how to make drinks. They make you stir your own drink because they're too lazy to do it.. I got a a coffee with vanilla powered and it was just at the bottom. Not even stirred. They also gave me a cheese danish not even warm. Unprofessional. Only nice person was the girl that took orders.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Apr 11, 2022~Chelsea was so sweet and made mine and my friends drinks, even though there was an overwhelming line of customers, she still took the time to make them perfect!! Definitely will be a returning customer :)
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~Feb 8, 2023~This is the worst of the worst as far as drive thrus go...10 minutes in line before making it to the ordering panel, then acknowledged by, `"I helped you already right?`" You can't be apart of a chain or franchise and be so disorganized unless you have a serious management problem.  Today is a Saturday but I would never dream of coming here on an actual weekday--not convenient.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jul 18, 2020~This store is horrible! Don't go here! The staff is rude, slow, and are mad about working! I will never go here again!!!!!!!! I should have asked for a refund and went elsewhere, next time I definitely will! Wish I could give 0 stars for this location!
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jan 25, 2023~I go to Starbucks every day for the past 15 years and I unfortunately will not be going to this location which is down the street from my home. I understand that sometimes they don't take larger bills more than $20 I had a $50 bill and that's all I had And the manager on duty pretty much said because my order was only two drinks, and they had just dropped change. They were unable to service me unless I had a different method of payment, which I didn't very disappointed with this customer service didn't even offer to give me my drinks for free or, any other option so unfortunately I left with no drinks waited 15 minutes in the drive-through for nothing my money wasn't good enough unfortunately, very dissatisfied I worked in retail in management for many years and I would've taken care of my customer knowing that they come every day I have spent thousands of dollars for the past 15 years I guess I'll take my business to Dutch!
Phoenix, AZ 85051~4~May 27, 2023~Monday 7:35am- surprisingly, the drive thru was empty. Normally, it's so busy every morning I pass by. This isn't my usual Starbucks but service was fast and very friendly. I'd return.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jun 17, 2019~One of the worst Starbucks I've been at. Some of the workers always have an attitude and act like they hate working here. I am so tired of pulling into this Starbucks during their open hours just to find the drive thru is closed for no reason. Happened again tonight get there about 1.5hr before they close and drive thru has a barrier infront of it. So ridiculous guess I will have to go to a different one .
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Nov 19, 2020~Stopped by this morning and was highly dissatisfied, my drink tasted like sanitizer water, wth!! My day is ruined
Phoenix, AZ 85051~3~Feb 14, 2019~This is the Starbucks you go to if you want them to make your drink wrong. I live near this Starbucks but hate going because the line gets so long but the lot isn't big enough to support a long line. Easy traffic jam. I can only count a handful of times where they made my coffee or tea correctly. One time they didn't have any cold brew. Another time they didn't have any peach infusion.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Apr 10, 2021~I have an additional observation I wanted to share. This starbucks location runs out of certain items sometimes. This is a drive-thru location with no inside dining room and there is no way to escape the drive-thru line if you can't order what you came for. The drive-thru line can back up and the crossover traffic starts to block the parking lot then it causes customers to become trapped in the drive-thru line. When you finally get to the drive-thru speaker to place an order and they tell you, `"we ran out of that...`" You will become trapped and you have to wait for 20 minutes or more just to exit the drive-thru line.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Dec 22, 2018~This Starbucks location is only a drive-thru with a walk-up window in a dangerous spot. The drive-thru can get very busy during certain mornings where the drive-thru line can potentially back up into the street making it unsafe for motorists and pedestrians.  The drive-thru lane wraps around the building. If the location is very busy, there can be a traffic crossover in the parking lot that can create another unsafe situation.  Traffic can enter from two separate street entrances and can clog up the parking lot when too many cars enter the property.  Merging into the drive-thru lane can become tricky and frustrating if this happens. Also, the scenerio causes the drive-thru exit to become blocked by traffic sitting in the lot when cars are waiting to merge into the drive-thru line. The drive-thru line wraps around the building. If you choose to park in the lot try backing out of the parking space when vehicles are waiting to merge into the drive-thru line. There is no place provided to sit if you use the walk-up window and there are no public restrooms provided. If the location becomes very busy it can become difficult to exit too. Also, some of the location staff has been rather sassy and rude to customers but other workers have been so-so. The staff are not always very friendly here. I spoke to one female manager about my concerns and she was very rude to me. She told me that I should call the City of Phoenix to complain about street traffic caused from the Starbucks. They have plenty of other customers and they don't need me. She also said I could go somewhere else and that I didn't make any sense among other things... There is a Dunkin a mile West of here up the road.  Most other Starbucks locations don't have employees that will talk back and argue with customers. This one is a little different. Starbucks was contacted about the situation and they indicated they are not interested in a resolution at this time.  They think they have other convenient locations and they won't consider a future location. It sounded like the manager wanted to send business over to Dunkin. However, there are not very many other locations in the area and especially if you are headed in certain geographical directions from the southwest of this facility. See if you can find a convenient location. On the other hand, if the location is not very busy and the drive-thru line is not clogged up then there are usually no issues. In any case, It's probably better to avoid this Starbucks location if you don't have to visit this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~1 year ago~Great service very friendly and they always get my drinks right. Saw some questionable reviews if this location which appear to be some high school drama.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Oct 9, 2020~I am never going here again! Arrived at the drive thru at 8:15 and waited till 8:35 to be informed it was closed. There was no sign on the drive thru or anywhere that it will be closing at 8 instead of 9.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Jan 25, 2022~Waits are long but I mean it's Starbucks what do you expect! Staff is always friendly and never messed up my order. I was really surprised to see some of these reviews. Maybe just go to a different Starbucks at least you would make the rest of our waits shorter!!! Haha
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jun 18, 2020~Went to  this location and line was so long  people couldn't get out of drive-thru window so I decided to  go to walk up window where I was initially ignored. Ordered a matcha Frappuccino, my drink  took 15 minutes to make  wrong. It was so sweet I had to throw it away. Why are you not consistent with the rest of Starbucks, will not  recommend this establishment.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~4~Nov 28, 2019~I ordered a drink this morning on the mobile-app, I love how it was so easy and the girl that helped me out was a sweetie. I will go back and use the mobile-app again. Super easy and fast. No wait time at all.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~May 7, 2019~The worst Starbucks ever!!! I had to wave my hand a few times to get anyone's attention at the drive thru window only to be ignored after 3 employees looked right at me. Finally one employee tells me, someone will be right with me. My drink sat at the window for 3 mins getting cold. I also ordered a WARM banana but bread only to receive it cold. Thanks Starbucks at 43rd Ave and Olive. I may be late to my job interview now.... I would give zero stars if I could.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Dec 10, 2019~The first guy that helped me was so low energy and new tbh. He took one order and didn't ask if that was it so he closed the window on us AANNDD THENNNN I rang the door bell cuz whatever. But the next girl to help me was so dead! No energy, bad attitude and rude demeanor!!! So rude!! I wish I could give them half a star.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~Apr 14, 2019~Ok normally am very satisfied and happy! I ordered a drink through app on Tuesday my drink was ready for pick up! And yes it was busy and my drink didn't just look like a sloppy drink just mushed together! Today the reason is the Affrogota shot makes it like that!!! Annoyed because hey presentation should be something when you paying the price of almost a meal just for a cup of coffee I get a sloppy drink looking! Stood at window and still had to wait for people who ordered right in front of me get there before I got mines and yes it's all about patience but just annoying when I put in an order online pay and yet someone who walk in line in front me orders and gets there first really I ordered 15 minutes ago they ordered 2 minutes and get there really........ guess it depend on who is working! Just annoyed with having to wait longer and my drink just looking like they just tossed everything in it! NO nice Starbucks presentation! Sorry my complaint sounds stupid lol but I guess I am so use to having the nice Starbucks presentation and then getting a drink that looks like I got a caramel milkshake from McDonald's and paying Starbucks price..... just annoying! My complaint is silly but My caramel Frap, with 2 shots of Affrogato shot drink taste good and overall! And I guess that's what they mean about (coffee with ice cream) shot.. Ohhhhh but it's just so sloppy looking that it makes it hard to really enjoy because `"hey presentation from Starbucks is a plus`" makes me feel like my dollar is being spent right! Silly complaint... I know! I know!
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Mar 8, 2019~A girl named Chaz spit in my drink and told me to shut up when I asked for a new one. I don't know what to do about this but it is concerning
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Sep 22, 2020~Came to this location on Thursday 11/19. We waited more than 15 minutes in  drive thru line, while the barista  was having a full conversation with a customers. There was about  7 other cars in front of me also waiting.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~1 year ago~They were very unfriendly and I thought maybe it was because they were busy but then I got my two hot coffees I drove out the drive through and took a sip my drink was lukewarm. It's so upsetting that after I even tipped (and didn't even get my receipt to scan) my drinks weren't even hot.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Apr 28, 2021~Bad service all around won't be going to this location ever again. Seems like the only location that doesn't do refills on teas
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Aug 23, 2018~I'm a regular at this location and today I decided to not take drive- thru because there was a long a long line . That was a mistake,  I was in line from 846a and I walked out of there at 914a. It was hot but I didn't mind to be honest what bothered me was that even when I waited that long my drinks weren't made correctly. Some barristas at Starbucks when they're asked to make the drink again because it's not how you usually get it or it's off for whatever reason . It's like they don't agree with you. Sometimes they should just ask what can they do to make it better instead of `" that's how we make it . `" Also , I think that they should maybe have a sign or something to let customers know that there's a long wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Aug 1, 2020~Thank you guys for getting my drink wrong before I have to go into work so I can't even turn around and get a new one. So fucking annoying how I can notice my drink looks weirder than usual and I ask the cashier taking my money `"hey are you sure this is my green tea lemonade?`" She legit looks me in my face and says `"yes.`" LOOK AT THE DAMN DRINK, there was already a line and I couldn't say `"no this is wrong make it again.`" I'm not an asshole but damn you guys know how to ruin someone's day. If you guys weren't the only Starbucks nearby that I don't have to go into a grocery store to get I wouldn't buy from you, id have more enjoyment watching my money be spent places that get my simple orders correct.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Mar 22, 2019~Worst Starbucks ever , I ordered 4 iced vanilla lattes and they gave me 4 black iced coffees and i went back to fix my order and they said I didn't order what I said I showed the receipt and they're like oh sorry they give me my drinks back and they're still a complete different drink so I just left it at that , workers are idiots
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Apr 7, 2019~Every time I come to this Starbucks they manage to get my order wrong or charge me wrong. Maybe it's just me but they also have the worst attitudes. They rarely say hello and just stick there hand out for your card, you're lucky if they bother mentioning the total.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Feb 13, 2020~i used to love this starbucks everyone was so kind and attentive but when the barista at the window tells me they don't have my order because the person in front payed for me but took my drinks?  and they take forever to make the drinks and still make them incorrectly
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Apr 27, 2021~Asked for heavy cream, they `"ran out`"... asked for splendas, they didn't add any... asked for vanilla syrup, she didn't add any... very disappointing. My first crappy Starbucks drink on Christmas.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~4~Dec 25, 2018~This has to be the only stabucks around. They are amazing, there is another TIffany who makes mobile orders about the same time as I do in the mornings. If there ever is a mix up they are so quick to fix it! My drinks are generally always about the same my complaint is the freaking people the customers, the size and the horrible traffic in and out of this spot. In order to wait in the drive through line you're blocking patrons who parked and drive through exit not to mention the the entrance/exit
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~May 14, 2018~Really REALLY suggest management review their protocol for keeping the line moving thru the drive thru. There are those who show up to the ordering speaker unprepared and then they want to change their order at the window! Management should have them pull over to the side or one of the parking lanes so that the rest of the  line of cars doesnt have to wait over 15 min for a single item.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~1 year ago~One starfor the super sweet girl working the drive through window, Waited in the amazingly- long line which always take forever unless you get there at a time when nobody's there,ordered my usual peach green tea,finally make it around to the pick up window. As I'm chatting it up with the girl in drive-through waiting for the rest of my order I take a sip of my peach green tea and can instantly tell something is not right. I tell her the drink taste off and repeat what I had ordered,she says `"oh we're out of peach green tea`" she offered to fix it with guava or something else, but because I am on a strict keto plan I was unsure about substitutions. Frustrated that the girl who took my order did not convey the message to me that they were out of the peach green tea and I also feel like I should've got my money back since it was not what I ordered and I didn't get anything else to replace it. Usually have good luck at this location,but not having what I order and not letting me know is kind of major to me.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Jun 15, 2020~One of the things that makes this Starbucks a high quality restaurant is the extremely friendly and hardworking employees that go out of their way to make your experience a very pleasant one.  I've never been disappointed or treated poorly at this current location.  As one can see, while you are in the cafe, you can't miss the quickness and efficiency of these pleasant individuals.  Every drink and food item is prepared by properly trained employees who never missing a beat with the flavor. Every employee at this location is representative of the communities that they serve, especially at this location.  The different styles and friendly personalities makes this location  a genuine coffee house vibe. As said by a consumer `"This company has earned its popularity by maintaining a great quality business.`" Starbucks makes their location fitting for everyone, giving them a cool friendly vibe, with a modern style.     Starbucks has an extremely fast drink making and food process, the quality however in top notch.  Every Customer has a certain time frame they want their drink made within before they get upset. Starbucks employees are trained to make drinks quickly and accurately using precise recipes.  Every drink is made exactly the same to ensure drink accuracy and customer enjoyment. Starbucks also has a mobile order service that allows you to order ahead. From experience, if you are short on time, and still needing your caffeine fix, you can destress by using the website or mobile app to place your order.  You can pick it up in the drive thru or walk up window and be on your way.  Sometimes freshness may be an issue , especially if the service lines are out onto the street. One thing this starbucks does compensate you for your long wait or if your drink is not up to your standards. Every Starbucks is different, but you won't be disappointed in this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 28, 2024~I had an Amazing Conversation with J, manager of the Best Starbucks in ouSolar System. J Reflects it began in 2016 as a Barista. He is from Phoenix, AZ.

Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 8, 2024~I go to this Starbucks often and I love the staff here!! They are all soooo friendly and cute! It is always clean and has a positive vibe. My drinks are always made perfectly. They handed out little samples the other day through the driv-thru and I was shocked (I've never gotten one before haha!) but I was so excited!! Thanks Starbies :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jul 13, 2023~I go to alot of Starbucks and spend alot of $ there because there customer service is usually great for one of the reasons. It's a very large company now with thousands of employees so I knew I'd eventually run into some bad ones and the Manager Ben at this one is the worst Starbucks employee I ever met.Over a year ago, I was in a hurry and left my cup on my table at their Bell and Tatum location. The manager at that time, Ben again, ran after me outside and ordered I go back inside and throw the cup away. I usually do clean up after myself as a courtesy but in my opinion customers are not obliged to clean their tables. This is part of the employees job when necessary. Starbucks is not cheap and thats part of the service.I told `"Ben`" I was not going back in to clean my cup off and bye.I posted a negative review on `"Ben`" for this incident as I believe it was totally out of line, as well as his demeanor, tone and phrasing was very aggressive and demanding after I already left the store.About a year later it turns out `"Ben`" is managing the SB at Thunderbird and 40th st. I didn't realize this until he jumped in my personal space and again demanded I clean one cup off the table as I was leaving. He even demanded we have a `"talk`" at the table that I must watch my behavior at `"his`" Starbucks if I want to remain a customer there. I told him I just won't go there anymore because I don't pay a premium for coffee to be harassed and treated so disrespectfully.Note: I have been going to Starbucks regularly since 1994 and have never dealt with a manager as rude as Ben and have never had anyone else tell me to clean my table. I usually do this anyway but on the rare times I leave something it's a cup or two and not my job to clean everything as all other employees understand apparently except Ben. He is literally the only manager I've encountered acting this way in my close to 30 years of Starbucks patronage spending thousands of my $$ at over 1000 Starbucks.Today, I go to this PV location looking to get out of the 115F heat for a cool drink and there is Ben again! I literally thought this guy was like Jack Nicholson in `"The Shining`". He was behaving in a very creepy, threatening way and jumped in my personal space again blocking my way shouting `"REMEMBER ME!!!`"I was seriously worried this guy would get violent and backed away and realized it was Ben from the Bell and Thunderbird locations(which presents the question why is he  moving around so much apparently other people have issues with `"Ben`").
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 8, 2024~So disappointed- I walked into pick up my order with my child and we walked into a huge gay pride flag inside the store. This is just unacceptable to me- I'm not anti pride, however as I business, you should not be shoving your beliefs down customers throats. This is not a discussion I should be having with my child when we just went in to innocently get a drink. Politics and business should not be mixed. I am so disappointed. I will not be returning to Starbucks, and this location specifically. Do better Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 19, 2023~Love this Starbucks. My order is always ready when I arrive and even though I place mobile orders, the team still goes out of their way to interact with me. Christina is always very friendly and helpful!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 10, 2021~Second time at this location. Absolutely, love it. Always well staffed with friendly staff and providing awesome customer service. I love the size of this location, plenty of elbow room for those still concerned about social distancing.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 3, 2023~they don't have the toasted white chocolate mocha anymore as part of their seasonal drinks for the holidays :( but i heard there are some alternate ways to order. Peter one of the baristas was so helpful and gave excellent service and i hope this is seen by managers so he is recognized for his hard work and service!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Dec 19, 2023~They've  got a good employee, their service is always respectful and meaningful, customer's service ain't that bad
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 7, 2023~Peter, thank you for correcting MY mistake and remaking my coffee for free. I so appreciate your kindness today.  40th St and Thunderbird
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 30, 2022~Sandwiches left under heater too long!Our sandwich had no evidence of cheese other than the bread had turned orange because it melted into the bread. We got so sick because of these sandwiches that I can't say I will ever get a sandwich at this location!Please beware of when sandwiches come off of the heat lamp!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 2, 2023~Kara made my husband and I's quick stop into starbucks an awesome one! She was above and beyond helpful and friendly. It's rare to come across employees who take pride in what they do and have a genuine kindness towards customers. Any company is lucky to have Kara as a part of their team!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 16, 2023~Worse, I don't understand it took 12 min for me to receive my nitro coffee after I placed an order. I'm watching 2 people stand around not working. Drive thru is quicker. Nitro cold brew you pour it and place in counter. 12 min!!!! I'm over Starbucks and having to use drive thru to get my order .
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 13, 2020~Ran in while I was waiting to meet a friend. I had never been inside this location and was impressed with the open concept! I used to work at Starbucks and really enjoy the diverse architecture of their buildings! The service was friendly enough and my beverage was delicious! They are practicing safe social distancing during these Covid-19 times. Thanks Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 26, 2023~Worst service in town! The girl on the window was super mean and angry. Very disappointed
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 23, 2022~Love this location! This is the second time I got a friendly note! Thank you for the great drink and great service!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 24, 2023~Always been a great location! My drinks are always made quickly &amp; the taste is always spot on. Trae made my coffee this morning and did great!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jan 2, 2023~Cool spot. It can get loud so not the best to study. People aren't as considerate here. The new manager was conducting an interview right behind me and he knew I was studying. He should've been able to read the room. Like I said, not the best spot to study.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 22, 2020~This location is now located where the old Boston Market was. I noticed some other reviews have talked about this establishment but they have the wrong address. This is not the one located in the Fry's grocery store across the street from this location. This location is a stand-alone establishment with a great patio and drive-thru. It has tons of seating and the ambiance is absolutely outstanding. I am glad to have such a wonderful new Starbucks within walking distance of my apartment. Eat, Drink, and be Merry, my Friends!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Aug 3, 2021~this starbucks is so nicely decorated.  staff seemed nice and super friendly with their regulars.  took us a bit to get our ready which i didn't understand why.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 14, 2022~Outstanding location with spacious interior and nice seating, and friendly employees. They wished me a happy birthday when I redeemed my drink which was awesome.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 15, 2021~Went here this afternoon and was very fortunate to be helped my Haley! She was kind polite and very knowledgeable! The drink was absolutely amazing like usual and if you're planning on going here don't forget to ask for Haley!!!! ^_^
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Aug 14, 2021~One of the better and newer Starbucks locations. Drinks are consistent and the employees are friendly. Sometimes takes a while to get your drink even if it's not very busy. Was told they were short-staffed and trying to hire more employees.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 12, 2020~I love this location, even tho it just opened up it looks amazing. It has a super chill vide and the whole lay out is very open and clean. Although you can't really sit down rn they do offer drive through and mobile orders. Which is really great if yoo he's running late. Although the customer service is nice and I've never had a rude barista here, it does take a lot longer than others in the area.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Sep 5, 2021~This place has a lot of mosquitos flying around. Gets pretty annoying when you're trying to study or get work done.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 18, 2020~This is a shout out to the lady who served my Venit iced Blonde Latte with toffee nut and white chocolate around 2pm. You made my week! The simple small talk made reality so much better!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Nov 6, 2020~The staff is always kind no complaints here. I do have a recommendation and this is the only way I know how to share it. I understand you were very busy. My frustration is that the lobby was full people were not socialdistancing we need help in this. everyone was crowding the drink station this morning because there was no order on drinks while we waited. The names were called out once for a hot second and put away. People were unnecessarily crowding . People coming in didn't know these drinks were behind a black cardboard box. My drink came out and the lady didn't even bother saying my name. I know my name is difficult but there was 9 people waiting and the only thing g clear was no order amongst the team. I understand the urgency on making the drinks but you need a better system and please call out coffee names loud enough to hear , do t hide it behind a black card board where we can't see drinks are being held and even if my name is difficult to say .... say it , make it up but do something.  Also my app was not working and it's the only reason I had to wait 25 min for a single iced coffee drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jan 28, 2021~Okay I am gonna be that person to complain about my drink as it was made incorrectly multiple times and I have stopped going as a result. I order an iced coffee with extra sweetener and extra cream. Every single time I have gotten it it has neither enough sweetener nor cream by a long shot. I asked them to please add more once and I got attitude and barely any fix. I don't feel like spending almost $4 for a burnt taste in my mouth. It's not a difficult drink to make and it's never been that busy when I order it.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 29, 2020~Visited this location today. Ordered some iced drinks to ease the 115 degree afternoon. My wife and I were the only ones in the store. We ordered drinks and started to wait. I was expecting a very important doctors call and it came as we were waiting. I distanced myself and pulled my mask down when an employee named Jeremy shouts at me to put my mask on. I point to my phone as in trying to listen to the doctor. Here shouts again. I turn so he can see my phone thinking maybe he didn't realize I was listening. He shouts about the mask again. I can't hear the doctor because this guy won't stop repeating himself. I'm ten feet away from the nearest person but he still persists about putting the mask on. I go outside, it's 115 degrees but at least I can hear. Jeremy is a really poor example of customer service. I not only felt totally unvalued as a customer, Jeremy was also shouting at me with an arrogant attitude that was completely insulting.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~3~Nov 9, 2024~Like the interiors. Very residential feel, with a 70s inspired sofa. Coffee and food is the usual.  Decent service. But prices are getting out of hand.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Nov 16, 2024~this Starbucks location seems to struggle in getting their sh*t together.The wait time is lengthy, even when there are only 1-2 cars ahead of you. Today I waited a total of 10 minutes to get a double espresso- I mean, come on.Additionally, their drinks are average at best. It is clear the effort is minimal at best. For example, they struggle to get cold foam foamy, or to the 'top'. and have forgot to to add the flavoring I requested more than once. Furthermore, it's rare that you see the same face twice. Its clear this Starbucks struggles from the top down, meaning, it is clear that management and ownership lack skill or even regard for this store.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Apr 30, 2024~Once again Starbucks serves up a perfect duplicate of my usual drink.If you are a Starbucks fan, you will be satisfied.The inside is clean and has a good number of work spaces. The outdoor patio has four tables which are sometimes in the sun and sometimes not. Probably best to be outside in the morning.My coffee was served quickly and was just right.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Oct 11, 2024~Just so slow. So so slow. Each car should not take that long. I had a mobile order placed 20min before and it still took 5 minutes to get my coffee at the window.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Nov 4, 2023~A bit different experience from other poor reviews, in that the drive-thru line was moving much, much faster than mobile orders. It's been over 30 minutes so far, and `"there are several orders ahead of us`". No manager to speak to, and no real concern with the lack of throughput. More people standing inside than in the drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Oct 8, 2021~This Starbucks is only a few months old and it does look nice and New with a cool store length couch and outside lounge chairs that are very comfy. They're also open until 9pm vs. most open til 7pm.Barista Travis and Manager Marisa did a superb job making me a happy customer.I rank this a top 10 Starbucks in Phoenix.The only negative is they don't have Wi-Fi yet.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Nov 13, 2023~Great location with fast and friendly service. We always like this location for convenience and consistently great coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Jul 22, 2023~Literally the worst Starbucks in the state. Employees are rude, they take forever (literally 20 minutes in the drive through) ..we got the order wrong and when we told them about it the barista got mad and argued with us, supervisor got involved and he even didn't apologize or tried to make it right
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Jan 22, 2022~Don't go to this Starbucks unless you want to wait 30 minutes in line and still get your drink not well made. We waited 33 minutes for 3 drinks on a 6 car line. Kind of ridiculous. Employees are not well trained in here, we have never got our drinks right when we have come to this location
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Sep 15, 2023~Ryan is the most amazing employee. So friendly and kind. Always has a beautiful smile for us when we arrive. We will continue to visit this location because of him..thank you Ryan
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Sep 3, 2023~This location is busy always in drive thru, which is great! Some days I like to go in and order my coffee and look at the merchandise. 2x this week I have done so and not one person acknowledges me while I stand at the cashier . They are all busy making orders. I have to get back in my car and then order thru drive thru. It's ridiculous. Not even a hello , nothing.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Dec 6, 2021~Customer service = needs improvement.Coffee = needs improvement.At least have one of the two down, you're a coffee shop. No garbages outside on site. Let's litter our Starbucks junk everywhere. I'm not overly thrilled about neighborhood Starbucks. They aren't consistent.Beautiful NEW Starbucks.... It's corporate America.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Mar 11, 2023~Service was terribly slow ordering regular coffee. The interior is very plain and uninspired. Coffee ok.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Feb 16, 2022~I've been coming here at least 3x a week for the past 2 months and they get my order wrong at least 1x a week. Today I ordered a latte and there was NO COFFEE in it. The entire cup was pure foam. And when they get too busy they randomly turn off the mobile ordering option or close the lobby. Not the best way to run a business.Do yourself a favor, go across the street to 32 Shea or Press, unless you have lots of free time to wait in the drive thru to get a $5 cup of foam.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~3~Mar 5, 2023~It's aight. All my shawties fwi, so it's koo. Get a refresher and add vodka and you'll be straight
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Apr 16, 2023~HOT. MESS. Fifteen minute drive thru time and they got both items in my order wrong :/
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Sep 28, 2021~Love this new location! Such easy access from the 51/Shea Blvd exit, and much closer than the PV one, I have only been through the drive-thru, and every time I get a super warm and friendly barista! Love that, love the convenience and The Pumpkin cream cold brew!! So delicious and my Bella's pup-a-cchino!!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~May 9, 2023~Terribly slow drive through-- And not very friendly. Plus they are always out of stuff.  I go only as a last resort!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Sep 20, 2022~Despite numerous terrible experiences at Starbucks I still like their drinks so I was super excited to see a new Starbucks going up so close to home :D I was thinking maybe since this location was new they would bring some seasoned employees from other stores over to help train and operate the business. Boy was I wrong. I've been to this location twice. The first time I waited 15 minutes for a single drink that was not made the right way. The lady at the window was friendly and offered to remake it but I paid for the drink and accepted it anyways to not make a big deal out of it. Before I left her and another employee walked over to another area and got me two $4 gift cards to give to me since my order was wrong and I waited so long. I thought that was super nice, typically Starbucks doesn't give a shit. The next day I decided to give this location another shot and ordered two drinks. When I pulled up to pay I waited over 15 minutes at the window and the same woman working was there, she let me know they were still making the drink. I could see the guy in the car behind me getting agitated since the drive through for a Starbucks shouldn't take more than a couple minutes for just a drink. When I handed her the two gift cards I received the previous day she told me there was nothing on them..... as in they had given me two empty gift cards. I had already decided I was over it and just handed her my debit card to pay instead of arguing with her or reminding her I was the same girl that was there less than 24 hours ago and she had been the one to give me two empty cards. Avoid this store.... The staff are scatterbrained and the drive through takes longer than if you were to go inside.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Oct 15, 2022~I don't usually write reviews but I am really disappointed in the staff at this location. Specifically Kathie. Everytime she is there when I go she is not friendly and impatient. Also a couple times she has messed up my simple order.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Nov 19, 2021~Great new location. Friendly staff makes perfect drinks. Patio and nicely appointed interior.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Apr 13, 2022~Service is always great, really nice partners. My drinks always seem to taste horrible and it's very apparent that they don't shake teas or refreshers. Bar partners might need to go back to the barista basics.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~4~Mar 2, 2022~Everyone that works here has always been so nice to me and always remembers my name and I appreciate that. I haven't had an issue with my coffee but I don't understand why they are closed a lot. I have a gift card very excited to use walk over there and they're closed again before 5pm!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Jan 20, 2022~i went through the drive thru this morning at around 7:15 and the line was crazy long and they had alot of people inside. i am more than happy to wait because everywhere is understaffed right now. i got to the window and the girl who was working (didnt catch her name but she had long brown hair up in a ponytail) was so nice and i had to have my drink remade which i always feel so bad about when they are busy but she made it seem like no big deal and was very sweet. she ended up just giving me the mess up drink and that really made my day! she needs a raise starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Apr 16, 2022~drinks are great! cups not so much, lids specifically. second day in a row having my lid come off as soon as i grab my cup. i recommend trying out sturdier lids. thank you.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 16, 2023~Greetings to fellow travelers and Yelpers.This is by far my # 1 location of Starbucks!I refer to it as My HQ. For 4 1/2 years I have met and had discussions with my people.Originally from Baltimore,Md. ; I relocated to this beautiful part of our Nation on December 18, 2018. This location was not open! In factBoston Markets was the previous tenant.Starbucks started from the ground up! Familyfriendly, lots of kids and grandparents.This morning, I met with one of pastors at my New Church. Pillar Church. 2 Shout Outs, one To pastor Preston Morrison and the other Shout Out to Dr.Phil Goldsberry. Pastor Morrison is very Animated , Bright, Articulate and knows the Word of God. Dr. Phil is a connector of People!I spent an hour with him and he had an Associate contact me. In fact I received an email from Jeff Daigle. Who I introduced myself to this past weekend. Jeff took 90 minutes out of hi as busy schedule to meet meStarbucks is Always busy! The Barista's know how and what I drink . We know each other by name. Feels like my Home away from home.Pictures to follow. You could not ask for a more Professionally trained staff who all go the Extra Mile.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 4, 2021~Every time I have used this Starbucks for my latte I'm always disappointed. They got my order wrong, coffee espresso shots were extremely bitter, no foam on the latte, and too hot. Every time. Will not be going to the Starbucks again they've used all their tries.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Nov 19, 2019~Very pretty and brand new!  Friendly baristas.     I got my usual...Trenta unsweetened iced coffee.  Boring on my part.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 26, 2020~Was a horrible experience. Wasted approximately an hour of my day that I'll never get back. Look for a Starbucks to stop and have a breakfast some coffee and get some email and other computer work web-based completed only to find that the Wi-Fi is less than a trickle. Unacceptable. I will no longer be frequenting Starbucks particularly this location and encourage others who want to use electron a device to stay clear apparently there's two Wi-Fi accounts one for the manager and one for the store and the store is less than a trickle. I asked the employees and they said oh yeah we know. Looking around the Starbucks store no wonder there's no one in the shop. Fact nobody was in here working on the computer and the place is almost vacant is an example of the fact that they're not paying attention to the users and the patrons that frequent their store. Horrible experience at Starbucks 40th St. and Thunderbird.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Sep 26, 2024~Everyone is always so welcoming, friendly, and helpful...been going to this location for about 1 1/2 and I have never had any issues. Always saying hi on a first name basis and remembers orders and extremely timely!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 24, 2021~I hardly go here but since in the neighborhood shopping decided to stop in. Inside is clean, few tables outside for outdoor seating.  I ordered my usual iced chai tea latte. They look short staffed but i didn't mind waiting. Overall got my order right and would return here.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jan 9, 2020~So blessed and convenient to have a Starbucks at my workplace. They recently remodeled this Starbucks so it is very nice now. Much needed! Nice open floor plan and seems to be faster and more efficient. Staff is always super nice and always more then welcome to answer questions or recommend a few drinks. Previously they had a lot of staff turn around but seems like lately they have had the same staff which is great. Something I love to see, and I enjoy all the current staff members so if something changed to keep them, keep it up! I love that as employees we get the options to order ahead with Grubhub and pick it up. Makes it great to grab a coffee on break or on our way to a meeting. There is so many drinks I love here. I pretty much love all the fall/Christmas holidays lattes but on a average day I must say iced Carmel macchiato is my fav. I get it melted(mixed) and sub almond milk for a tad healthier option. Not saying this is a healthy drink at all...Lol. They recently recommended I try it with the blonde espresso which was fantastic. The blonde espresso taste smooth and lighter, doesn't seem as strong but it supposedly higher caffeine. Win win I guess, right? Well I'm thankful for this Starbucks. Basically helps me get my work done from 2pm on. Helps me finish the afternoon strong! See you again soon Starbucks, probably late today to be honest..... hehe :)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jul 26, 2022~It was delicious totally recommend def get the vanilla bean frap if you want to try something new
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Oct 8, 2022~When I went to Starbucks today they were out of pretty much every good sandwich I mean they still had my fav frap witch is the Carmel ribon one it's was amazing but ya Starbucks is normally my fav place
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jan 21, 2019~This Starbucks is located in my job and makes it so convenient. I love how quick and efficient they are, making a quick Starbucks run between breaks possible.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Oct 23, 2022~I've been to a lot of Starbucks locations and someare better than others. Some have personality and others are just an empty void and cattleline. The location on Happy Valley Road has a lot of personality and it all starts with Jocelyn.  She's a combination of several characters from the 1980s Cheers TV show.  Jocelyn is part Sam, Carla, and Diane.  Jocelyn knows everybody's name and if you're a regular like Norm or Cliff, and Dr Fraser, your drink is ready before you walk up to the register.  Jocelyn's smile and guffaw can't be missed. It's a bright red and cheery as her current hair color. Megan and the other staff members feed off of her infectious enthusiasm and make this location run like a well oiled machine.  The location is clean and has plenty of seating options indoor and outdoor.  Love the vibe of this location and I'm glad I had a chance to visit.  Maybe one day soon, I'll hear `" Charley!`" when I walk through the front door and be a regular like Cliff and Norm.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 14, 2024~Usually i really enjoy getting my drinks here, not today. I wasn't feeling well today and ordered a honey citrus mint tea aka a medicine ball. I noticed my drink tasted funny, but i brushed it off because I'm sick. Now my stomach is starting to hurt. I take a look at the tea bags tags and it says `"chamomile mint blossom`". I get very bad stomach aches from chamomile. If this happened to someone who is allergic that could have been horrible! I understand if you are out of the tea i want, but they could have at least told me if that was the case!
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Aug 25, 2024~Many of the baristas are friendly and efficient, but some are downright impatient and rude. The woman working the drive-through the morning of 8/25/24 took rudeness to the nth degree. We ordered five items including two beverages. We requested to use our points (balance 781) for the drinks as points were expiring. We had a previous problem with this location charging us and not using points when requested, so had called corporate and been assured everything was fine with our account. This location also has a history of not awarding us points to our account, but they ALWAYS send us a receipt with a request for additional tip. The barista could not redeem our points despite seeing that we had 781 points. She told us that had never happened before, acted like we were trying to pull a fast one, and told us the only thing we could do is pay now and call corporate. We told her we already did and they said everything was fine with our account, so she said we could come in Monday when the manager was there and call corporate in the store. (The call wait time was about 30 minutes btw.) She absolutely refused to honor the points she admitted that she saw we had! She then contradicted herself and said her system didn't register that we had an account, but we were sent a receipt and tip request from our `"non-existent`" account that she scanned. Her attitude and treatment of us as trying to get free stuff was ridiculous! Even with using points, we still would have been spending $15! We paid the full amount (receiving a receipt and tip request but no points), left, and immediately went to another Starbucks across the parking lot in Safeway. Guess what? Absolutely no problem redeeming our points and friendly, lovely service too! We will be using them in the future. This Starbucks is an epic fail when it comes to customer service and care. Minus ten stars really.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jan 16, 2022~I visit this Starbucks 4-10x a week as live nearby. The staff (especially Jocelyn, who works morning) is Super friendly and quickly remembers locals/ repeat customers by name and their drinks. I go early on the weekends and mingle with other locals and their dog(s) that everyone pets, plays with and even sometimes feeds..  We talk local stuff, sports, cars, etc.The mid day and evening crowd can be more quieter with laptops out and working or just relaxing catching up with others in person or over the phone.Drive thru can be stacked up which can cause parking to be tricky. But park to the side or closer to BKs for ease.5 stars; A+ as best Starbucks out of over150+ over 5 countries I've visited.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Nov 26, 2020~In the area and needed a caffeine jolt on Thanksgiving morning. When I arrived at this location there was a long line wrapped around the parking lot. So parked the car and went inside not a customer in sight. I was actually greeted and advise where to go to place order. Once I did I went to pay by my app on the phone. The nice lady behind the counter advised where to go. Every time the app is updated it is different. So she scanned my phone and transaction complete. Also a tall cappuccino was nearly a dollar less  at $3.75 than the last one I visited in South Florida at $4.55. Note prices do vary by location and region. If I blinked my drink was ready! It was hot and delicious. So thankful this Thanksgiving for the wonderful service and kindness shown to me in this location. Definitely will come back here again.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Mar 21, 2024~Service is iffy, i forgot to use my coupon so i got back in line, while i was waiting in line the cashier was helping someone who already ordered and paid for their drink and wanted to use a BOGO coupon, the cashier said she'll push it through even thought the lady already paid, so the lady in line got her 2 drinks, I ordered 3 drinks and when i told the cashier i wanted to use my coupon she said she can't help me, when she had just helped the lady in front of me with the same issue. she didn't offer a logical solution or anything.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Dec 30, 2023~Really nice staff and they are very helpful. If they don't get your drink to your liking they are always willing to fix it without getting upset with you
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Apr 22, 2019~It's your typical Starbucks :) the team seems to work hard and be attentive! This was a drive thru visit and I felt like everything went smooth, I truly have nothing bad to say other than it wasn't a WOW experience. Caitlin in the drive thru was great, she communicated well, had a smile on her face and my drinks were made correctly! We spoke about their new rewards program update for a quick minute and I learned something new- if you save up to 400 points (actually save and not use for free drinks), you could earn a Starbucks cup; so it could go towards actual merchandise which I like!A newer Starbucks opened about 7 minutes down the street so may have taken some of the bulk of the customers that come to this location, but this location has lots of parking, easy access and friendly employees.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~May 5, 2023~If I could rate it zero stars I would, the person in the drive thru taking order (Gia) was the rudest person ever... she does not know how to work with customers, plus she charged me wrong... there's no need to give bad attitude .....
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Dec 25, 2022~This Starbucks is hands down the best! Their staff are amazing I won't name them all because it would take too much time and sadly I would (because my brain ha) forget some and they all deserve to be named they know me and know my order. I'm one of those `"extra`" Boujee Starbucks orders and they are hands down the ONLY Starbucks that makes it right. They go out of their way to greet me and others and even when people are extra rude they keep a smile on their faces. I'm grateful they put up with me and love this one so much! If I ever move I'll have to drag them with me!! I would give them 10 stars if I could!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jan 16, 2022~Jocelyn puts her whole bussy into every coffee she makes. A+ customer service. Alyssa was also an incredible asset, sucks she left, but Jocelyn holds down the fort and makes magic in her drinks. Also, love how dog friendly it is!!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~May 27, 2018~Monday through Friday mornings are a lot like the old Alabama song, `"I'm in a hurry to get things done, I rush and rush until`" , well you get the point.  Typically I'll grab coffee from home, I can make my own Starbucks there, either Keurig or a nice Chemex pour-over. But on many a pleasant Phoenix morning I'll want the real McCoy made by a trained barista.What makes this possible on a `"school day`" is the wonderful Starbucks app. I have my gift cards loaded, my favorites saved (lately an iced americano with a splash of coconut milk, venti of course). I highly recommend the sausage, cheddar and egg sandwich if you need a protein boost. Or you can mix and match by walking across the parking lot to B-KIng for one of those heavenly but horrible crosissandwichs, sausage please.  Guilt but happy.  The app has some sort of gamification to it that if you collect the stars, you earn free stuff.  I'm lucky to remember to check in on Yelp let alone game on my way in to work with my 2 gig memory.While I always grab and dash, (my order is always ready to pick up when I get there) I'd love to sit and chill and people watch or surf the net.  This location has a great vibe to it, sweet patio also.  I love that Starbucks has changed their approach and will allow anyone to use their Facilites even if you're not buying anything.Oh, BTW, speaking of grabbing and dashing, my apologies to whoever ordered the spinach wrap last week and ended up with my breakfast sandwich.  I think you got the better end of the bargain on that one.   Cheers!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 9, 2023~This Starbucks had great customer service! I had issues with my drinks from another Starbucks and explained what happened to this store and they gave me two free drinks to make up for the problem with my last order from another Starbucks.  Very friendly staff and super clean environment here.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 23, 2018~This is one of the closest Starbucks with a drive thru. Also there is 3 Starbucks just on happy valley less then 5 miles from each other. They have a patio to sit outside with umbrellas! It feels kinda tight inside cause it's kinda small.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~May 19, 2018~I'm not quite sure why this particular location manages to obtain such low reviews.  I've never had any issues here at all.  After dinner this evening, I ran up &amp; got a couple of Frappuccino's for an after dinner treat. I hit up the drive-thru &amp; there was only (2) cars ahead of me.  I read the previous reviews about how slow the drive-thru was prior to heading out to this Starbucks visit.  From the time I spit out my order until the time the nice girl at the drive-thru window handed me my drinks, a whopping 2 minutes and 43 seconds passed.  How do I know that?  ...because I timed it. [insert climatic theme music here]  I guess I'm not personally the kind of individual who feels that's a horrific amount of elapsed time.  Obviously, when it's 7:30 a.m. on a Monday morning and the amount of vehicles in the drive-thru are wrapping around the parking lot into the Safeway gas station - I can't imagine that most of you are blown away that it may take more than 2 minutes and 43 seconds to get your drink.  If by chance you ARE blown away by that fact, perhaps you should stick to brewing your coffee at home.  Just sayin'...Anywho... the interior of this Starbucks location is exceptionally clean.  The restrooms are clean and the Wi-Fi is fast.  None of the staff has ever been rude to me.  I've been inside of this Starbucks numerous times and have been through the drive-thru even more.  The staff has always been friendly, cordial, polite and I've never had an order screwed up in the least.  Like.  Never.  The location is convenient and simple to access.  My only [minor] gripe would be the parking lot situation.  It's fairly cramped, but it's simply due to the sheer volume of surrounding shops and stores in the adjacent strip mall.  When the drive-thru line does get lengthy, there isn't a good place for the vehicles to oozing out of the drive-thru to land.  They essentially spill out into the small parking lot that can land lock the patron's who have parked to go into the location.  But again, if you're attempting to park here on a Monday morning at 7:30 a.m. - well, you're tempting a fate that you already know the answer to.My Frappuccino's this evening were fresh, ice cold &amp; sweet... just like my Yelp reviews.  Just kidding.  Sorta.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jan 9, 2020~Odd Starbucks vibe. The staff are very unfriendly. They seem more interested in talking about customers then actually providing customer service. Ordering a drink takes a bit of patience. I usually have to repeat myself. So much for listening.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Apr 30, 2021~I have never had to wait in line at a drive thru as long as I did here. Holy crow!!  It took 20 min just to PLACE my order. Ugh. I go to Starbucks drive thru because it's usually super quick. What is going on here?!?  This is like IN N OUT. Dang. If the line is around the parking lot, DON'T BOTHER unless you have 45min to kill. Which I do not. And now I can't get out of line. Super frustrating.   This drink better be freaking glorious.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Dec 8, 2016~My go-to Starbucks since I like the drive-thru as well as location. The inside is very clean and a modern/rustic feel. They have a ton of tables inside and outside on small patio which makes it nice to hang out on your computer or a great meeting spot. This Starbucks is always busy especially the drive-thru! The line goes pretty quick but just make sure you give yourself enough time because there is usually at least 10cars in line every morning. The drinks are always good and exactly what I wanted. Everyone is always friendly as well and hyped up on caffeine by 6am. HA!Starbucks prices are pretty high for coffee but that is expected for convenience. I love the holiday drinks &amp; cups but they definitely can get expense. I try to just go 1-2 days a week or stop by to get a refreshing tea as that is fairly cheap. My favorites are Pumpkin Spice Latte, Carmel Macchiato Iced, Cold brew, Carmel Frappuccino, and Green tea.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jul 25, 2019~I'm bummed anytime I give a poor review. This Starbucks In particular has poor customer service. That's always the thing I care most about. Treating others well especially when it's a customer.  Being in the service industry myself that's one of my main focuses!! My sisters and I came for a nice coffee date. There were 5 of us and 3 of the 5 drinks were made wrong. We asked for each drink to be remade and we got no apology. They simply just took the drinks from us and remade it. One of our waters spilled and so we went to the front to get a cloth to clean it and get a new water and we were completely ignored. It was just disappointing that simple customer service wasn't practiced at this location as well as not being able to listen to our orders. I will probably not be returning to this location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Oct 1, 2019~This is the 3rd time I have ordered a pumpkin scone and banana bread from this location and they have been so dry and old. I get them for my grandkids and will not be going back here ever again. It's bad enough they charge 2.95 for a slice of banana bread, at least it could be fresh.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Sep 13, 2016~Stopped by here after work and got a tall double chocolaty chip frap and a chocolate croissant. The drive thru moved quick, it was around 2:30pm and whoever Will is that was working the drive thru... he is awesome! The reason I'm writing this is because he just had positive vibes coming across that little voice box when I was ordering. You can tell he loved what he was doing and that just put a smile on my face. Plus he told me I was in luck today because all desserts were a dollar. YES! (Not sure if it's a usual thing they do, but if so, I wouldn't have guessed because Will made my experience so personal! And what I loved is that he didn't ask me if I wanted my croissant warmed up or not, he just gave it to me warm! Thank you. (Who likes cold croissants with the chocolate chunky??? Not me) AND the best frap I've had so far, I don't know what they did but it was extra good.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jul 6, 2018~Always out of food. Never have the spinach feta wrap after 11 am and then none or few of the follow up choices. My drink is messed up about 50% of the time. I order SF vanilla latte but they make it skinny with nonfat milk even though I order it properly and the label is correct, they still consistently make it wrong. Drive through is always slow and going in is slower. Do t waste your time, go to the Starbucks in Safeway, a little less convenient but worth the walk inside!
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Mar 18, 2018~Worst Starbucks in the valley!!!! Unfortunately, I would come here for convenience. My yoga studio was steps away. The staff are rude, drinks sub-par, pastries like rocks. Honestly, I have been in customer service for years and have never witnessed such nasty attitudes. It's a cup of coffee and a smile. This should not be much to ask for considering the prices  and the very grounds (maybe- pun intended) that Starbucks was founded upon. A great cup of coffee from a friendly community barista. Honestly, if you cannot be consistently pleasant to EVERY customer, perhaps you would be better off not working with the public. I have had to take my drinks from this Starbucks to a different location to have them re-made to make them palatable!!!! I have spoken with the manager and district manager that tell me the problem will be corrected. So far, not so.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jul 25, 2019~I used to love this Starbucks. Unfortunately, the service has gone down hill. They haven't made my drink correctly in the last three visits and it's only iced tea with no sugar. People make mistakes but it's how they react to them that is very telling. I never receive a free drink, apology and they even act like it's a huge inconvenience to remake it. I don't think I'll be going back to this location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Sep 11, 2012~This is a good Starbucks experience with all the expected amenities of WiFi, good coffee, happy service and some great people watching. However, beware of the cranky barista. Although my mom can be a bit much on the drink customization, that's no need for an eye-roll and huff. I would chalk it up to a bad day (everyone has them, even if they're made in the Starbucks Barista Kitchen, where only happy people are born). However, I've heard her be a bit short and huffy with a few customers. Overall, a great Starbucks in a great location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 19, 2021~11-19-2021 Pulled up in the drive five minutes before closing time was told they were closed. I asked would it be too much to ask for a water. Was told they already shut down the system  I use to be a shift here years ago when we gave customers water. Also your `"system`" has nothing to do with water. Little insider secret, that's not how water works but I appreciate the lie.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 22, 2017~After watching a barista struggle to scrape stuff out of the blender using her hand and a desperate cup, then getting the wrong drink even after I clarified 3 times which one I wanted (basic, simple frappuchino), then when I did get the 'right' drink it looked completely different than what it ALWAYS looks like when I get it from other stores BUT one of the other baristas was condescendingly repeating that was the right drink this time. One of the baristas dumped mocha coated ice back into the main ice bin!The first time it wasn't even the same frappachino, and the guy taking my order said `"umm, ya we have a mocha drink`" when I asked for a dark mocha. Sounded like he had NO IDEA what was on the menu! Nobody bothered to check anything with anyone else either. They acted like I was a nuisance.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jun 30, 2020~Starbucks is a vibe. Starbucks is one of the few public spaces I feel comfortable (currently). Given everything that is going on right now, Starbucks feels like a safe space. Being on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona during this time doesn't feel great for me because most people here are just mad and racist. I sought out Starbucks and I am happy I did. The lady at the window was so welcoming and peaceful; the food/drink was on point; and there was just an air of, for lack of a better descriptor, love. Additionally, they are taking social/physical distancing very seriously. It would be nice if most stores/restaurants/etc. felt this way inside. I generally go to the Starbucks in Noe Valley (San Francisco) and they are very, very nice as well.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~May 27, 2017~I love this location. I have been going to this location for years. Always friendly staff. Drinks are yummy, fast and generally made correctly. Drive thru time is usually the longest wait. I generally mobile order unless I have my kids then I go inside where we enjoy our drinks and snakes. I recommend getting a raspberry mocha. My favorite is the chestnut praline latte but it is seasonal and not till November. Kids usually get frapps.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Oct 21, 2017~This was at the bottom of my iced coffee.  Curdled milk.  Did not notice it until I started to stir with the straw.  This Starbucks location has steadily declined in quality in their product and customer service.  Gross!   Here's hoping I don't get sick from drinking some of it.  Disappointed.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 26, 2020~Leah is amazing here!!!! I called yesterday to ask about free coffee offer for healthcare workers! She confirmed the offer and we all got a cup of coffee for the afternoon to finish our 13 hour shift sharper! Thank you!
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Jan 14, 2015~Thats a bummer that they move the Starbucks over here. :(But I love the drive thru here. Long lines, but it moves quickly.... sometimes. :) it's smaller than usual. Very clean, great bartista here.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Oct 30, 2019~Slowest Starbucks drive through I've ever been to. It's slow every single time I go no matter what time of day. I wait less at chick fil a with 20 cars in front of me than this Starbucks with 2 cars in front of me. You can seriously assume it's about 5-7 minutes per car. They need to change something in the way they do things.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~May 3, 2018~Worst service ever.  Old lady taking orders sure thinks she's here for us.  Like we are a nuisance.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Aug 3, 2018~The worst Starbucks probably in the world. Never have product, and terribly slow. Inside or drive thru, doesn't matter. Always slow. Hire more people and carry the damn turkey bacon sandwich.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 16, 2019~This morning Leah was absolutely terrible. I didn't know they this location was out of pumpkin so I asked for a minute to decide on a different beverage. She kept mentioning the line behind me. I ordered quickly and was taking to the brunette at the window when again Leah chimed in saying no we are just out and we're not getting it back. We weren't even talking about the pumpkin at this point. Extremely rude. Not going back to this location due to the experience with Leah herself.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jan 6, 2021~I come here every morning and the employees are fantastic!  Great customer service and if there is an issue they are happy to fix it and make your drink the way you want!  New machines have really helped eliminate bitter espresso too!  I am so hopeful they reopen soon!!!  Miss my morning smiles from them!!
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Mar 18, 2018~Sunday mornings are crazy busy here. Sometimes the line for the drive thru is too much. My last three visits I walk in, get my coffee, and walk out. The best is seeing the same people still in line for drive thru. The store is clean. My coffee is fresh n hot, and the staff are super friendly. Thanks for being my pre-church coffee supply. Keep up the awesome work and fast friendly service.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Mar 25, 2018~Would add a zero if possible! The drive thru line took 45 minutes to get through. The Sunday morning crew must be different than other busy morning crews -- I've always had great experiences on weekday mornings. This team was rude and seemed annoyed. Mobile orders were prioritized, which i don't usually mind, but when your car has been trapped in the drive thru for nearly an hour, it's frustrating to see people pull up, order on their phone, and then go grab their drinks within minutes.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Dec 16, 2017~I'm done with this Starbucks as they have gotten our order wrong too many times now, every other place does a good job I am so confused on why this one has, had so many mishaps with us. We always say iced drinks, this time we got the salted caramel mocha and the mocha macchiato no whip like always and they gave them to us hot. Whatever it is I hope they fix it and maybe I'll give them another shot like last time.
Glendale, AZ 85310~3~Nov 29, 2017~I have been to this Starbucks three times, the third time was because i wanted to give them another chance. The first two times they messed up my orders, luckily the third time was the charm and they got my girlfriend and mines order 100% right. So the first time we went my girlfriends coffee was correct and i had a coconut-milk mocha macchiato (no whip just in case)... I have literally zero idea on what they brought me and it came with whipped cream (another starbucks i went to said that drink doesn't even come with whip). So i said I didn't want whipped, they just took it off and all it tasted like mocha syrup and coffee. Then the second time, decided to spice it up and get a salted caramel mocha. Mine was right this time but my girlfriend got the chestnut praline (again we say no whip incase over and over again to make sure for both of them). Hers came out with whip cream, they were nice about it and remade it for her.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Feb 13, 2019~The vanilla bean frappuccino is my favorite  this Starbucks is always so clean and the service is always speedy quick.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Sep 22, 2020~The customer service here is pretty good but I hate to say if you want a good drink then go to the one up the road in norterra, you can really taste the difference
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Apr 1, 2012~Excellent service. Friendly staff. They always greet me by name. And my drink is made just the way I like it.The drive-thru is for me since I am typically making a run up to Starbucks to grab a morning coffee or an afternoon pick me up and have my three children with me. There is no denying that this is a very busy location with a drive-through that can often span quite a distance, typically the length of one row of parked cars. However, I've always waited regardless since the line seems to still move quite quickly unlike other locations I've been to. The staff doesn't amazing job at managing orders while still making you feel welcome and not rushed!It's also great to see familiar faces when I'm not a daily regular but still I'm treated as one!I believe it's the staff from the previous location about 1 mile south on pinnacle Peak Road. Which that location closed a few years ago and it's nice to still see some of the same barista's working in greeting you from years ago. If you are at Starbucks drinker and I don't have a rewards account with them than my advice would be to get one because the benefits are amazing and include free drinks or pastries etc. I'm not sure the requirements now for the gold card; however back when I joined into thousand 10 I believe it was every 12 purchases and you got a free drink plus other benefits such as free refills on their in-house coffee and teas. I'm not entirely sure now what that for benefits are except that after so many dollars being spent or purchases that you do you earn free drinks as well as various offers and discounts from being a Gold card member. I do want to clarify that this is not a credit card by any means but rather a gift card that you would register into your name and make purchases on that gift card for the points or rewards. The gift cards can be reloaded or refilled.  Which means it is not at all a credit card of sorts but rather a prepaid gift card that is being used for purchases. Because I for one would not be signing up for a credit card just to get some coffee ;-)
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~May 20, 2019~Always come to this location and always get my coffee order wrong. I ask for cream in my coffee and it always looks dark brown like barely any is in it. Every other Starbucks in the valley gets it right except this location. Coffee tastes almost burnt half of the time or they don't fill their drinks all the way. Very disappointed. Not the nicest workers either.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Sep 15, 2017~I rarely go to any Starbucks anymore. The quality of the coffee and the customer service just is not what it used to be but yet the prices are higher. Go figure. This location in particular though has been super disappointing to me the handful of times I've been in. Employees who clearly don't care if you're there or not and espresso based drinks that are bitter tasting and way too expensive. Although it's close to my home, I'm done going there. Will either make my drinks at home or make the longer drive to a Dutch Brothers location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Dec 15, 2016~Robert is a super amazing employee to have their at your Starbucks!! Always has a smile while working through the drive-thru it seems to be a perfect way to start my day!!
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Jul 18, 2015~This is by far, the slowest Starbucks in the country, possibly the world! Even the home shop in Seattle is faster. Wait of average 15min just about 95% of the time.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Aug 10, 2016~This place have a old lady that gives horrible service,I felt like she's discriminated against Asians, today I went in to order a drink,I said `"purple drink`" 3 times and she make it sound like she didn't understand what I said,I pretty sure I pronounced it right and my friend hear that when I first said it.Every Time I go, in this old lady gives me the worst service ever!
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Sep 2, 2017~Went in for a venti iced coconut milk mocha macchiato and first they made I sloppy and the second time they made it sloppy with so much goop at the bottom I got a mouth full my first sip and they didn't use coconut milk. They have had progressively worse service recently
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Dec 12, 2019~I have been going to this starbucks every weekday morning for about the last five years. I have seen a lot of change over there over the years. It seems like every since they lost Nancy the business has gotten much slower and the employees do not move very fast at all. I have to wait forever to get my drink even though hardly any customers are there. This morning I ordered a sugar free skinny cinnamon dolce iced latte and the first time it came out it was hot, so then they re-made it and the second time it was iced but not sugar free. I never write reviews but felt that this time it was necessary.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Mar 7, 2019~The breakfast sandwiches were gross. And we ordered a puppachino and the said you mean a cup of whipped cream. Just unnecessarily rude. And to top it off we had to ask for it two more times because they kept forgetting.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Oct 23, 2022~I've been to a lot of Starbucks locations and someare better than others. Some have personality and others are just an empty void and cattleline. The location on Happy Valley Road has a lot of personality and it all starts with Jocelyn.  She's a combination of several characters from the 1980s Cheers TV show.  Jocelyn is part Sam, Carla, and Diane.  Jocelyn knows everybody's name and if you're a regular like Norm or Cliff, and Dr Fraser, your drink is ready before you walk up to the register.  Jocelyn's smile and guffaw can't be missed. It's a bright red and cheery as her current hair color. Megan and the other staff members feed off of her infectious enthusiasm and make this location run like a well oiled machine.  The location is clean and has plenty of seating options indoor and outdoor.  Love the vibe of this location and I'm glad I had a chance to visit.  Maybe one day soon, I'll hear `" Charley!`" when I walk through the front door and be a regular like Cliff and Norm.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 14, 2024~Usually i really enjoy getting my drinks here, not today. I wasn't feeling well today and ordered a honey citrus mint tea aka a medicine ball. I noticed my drink tasted funny, but i brushed it off because I'm sick. Now my stomach is starting to hurt. I take a look at the tea bags tags and it says `"chamomile mint blossom`". I get very bad stomach aches from chamomile. If this happened to someone who is allergic that could have been horrible! I understand if you are out of the tea i want, but they could have at least told me if that was the case!
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Aug 25, 2024~Many of the baristas are friendly and efficient, but some are downright impatient and rude. The woman working the drive-through the morning of 8/25/24 took rudeness to the nth degree. We ordered five items including two beverages. We requested to use our points (balance 781) for the drinks as points were expiring. We had a previous problem with this location charging us and not using points when requested, so had called corporate and been assured everything was fine with our account. This location also has a history of not awarding us points to our account, but they ALWAYS send us a receipt with a request for additional tip. The barista could not redeem our points despite seeing that we had 781 points. She told us that had never happened before, acted like we were trying to pull a fast one, and told us the only thing we could do is pay now and call corporate. We told her we already did and they said everything was fine with our account, so she said we could come in Monday when the manager was there and call corporate in the store. (The call wait time was about 30 minutes btw.) She absolutely refused to honor the points she admitted that she saw we had! She then contradicted herself and said her system didn't register that we had an account, but we were sent a receipt and tip request from our `"non-existent`" account that she scanned. Her attitude and treatment of us as trying to get free stuff was ridiculous! Even with using points, we still would have been spending $15! We paid the full amount (receiving a receipt and tip request but no points), left, and immediately went to another Starbucks across the parking lot in Safeway. Guess what? Absolutely no problem redeeming our points and friendly, lovely service too! We will be using them in the future. This Starbucks is an epic fail when it comes to customer service and care. Minus ten stars really.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jan 16, 2022~I visit this Starbucks 4-10x a week as live nearby. The staff (especially Jocelyn, who works morning) is Super friendly and quickly remembers locals/ repeat customers by name and their drinks. I go early on the weekends and mingle with other locals and their dog(s) that everyone pets, plays with and even sometimes feeds..  We talk local stuff, sports, cars, etc.The mid day and evening crowd can be more quieter with laptops out and working or just relaxing catching up with others in person or over the phone.Drive thru can be stacked up which can cause parking to be tricky. But park to the side or closer to BKs for ease.5 stars; A+ as best Starbucks out of over150+ over 5 countries I've visited.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Nov 26, 2020~In the area and needed a caffeine jolt on Thanksgiving morning. When I arrived at this location there was a long line wrapped around the parking lot. So parked the car and went inside not a customer in sight. I was actually greeted and advise where to go to place order. Once I did I went to pay by my app on the phone. The nice lady behind the counter advised where to go. Every time the app is updated it is different. So she scanned my phone and transaction complete. Also a tall cappuccino was nearly a dollar less  at $3.75 than the last one I visited in South Florida at $4.55. Note prices do vary by location and region. If I blinked my drink was ready! It was hot and delicious. So thankful this Thanksgiving for the wonderful service and kindness shown to me in this location. Definitely will come back here again.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Mar 21, 2024~Service is iffy, i forgot to use my coupon so i got back in line, while i was waiting in line the cashier was helping someone who already ordered and paid for their drink and wanted to use a BOGO coupon, the cashier said she'll push it through even thought the lady already paid, so the lady in line got her 2 drinks, I ordered 3 drinks and when i told the cashier i wanted to use my coupon she said she can't help me, when she had just helped the lady in front of me with the same issue. she didn't offer a logical solution or anything.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Dec 30, 2023~Really nice staff and they are very helpful. If they don't get your drink to your liking they are always willing to fix it without getting upset with you
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Apr 22, 2019~It's your typical Starbucks :) the team seems to work hard and be attentive! This was a drive thru visit and I felt like everything went smooth, I truly have nothing bad to say other than it wasn't a WOW experience. Caitlin in the drive thru was great, she communicated well, had a smile on her face and my drinks were made correctly! We spoke about their new rewards program update for a quick minute and I learned something new- if you save up to 400 points (actually save and not use for free drinks), you could earn a Starbucks cup; so it could go towards actual merchandise which I like!A newer Starbucks opened about 7 minutes down the street so may have taken some of the bulk of the customers that come to this location, but this location has lots of parking, easy access and friendly employees.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~May 5, 2023~If I could rate it zero stars I would, the person in the drive thru taking order (Gia) was the rudest person ever... she does not know how to work with customers, plus she charged me wrong... there's no need to give bad attitude .....
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Dec 25, 2022~This Starbucks is hands down the best! Their staff are amazing I won't name them all because it would take too much time and sadly I would (because my brain ha) forget some and they all deserve to be named they know me and know my order. I'm one of those `"extra`" Boujee Starbucks orders and they are hands down the ONLY Starbucks that makes it right. They go out of their way to greet me and others and even when people are extra rude they keep a smile on their faces. I'm grateful they put up with me and love this one so much! If I ever move I'll have to drag them with me!! I would give them 10 stars if I could!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jan 16, 2022~Jocelyn puts her whole bussy into every coffee she makes. A+ customer service. Alyssa was also an incredible asset, sucks she left, but Jocelyn holds down the fort and makes magic in her drinks. Also, love how dog friendly it is!!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~May 27, 2018~Monday through Friday mornings are a lot like the old Alabama song, `"I'm in a hurry to get things done, I rush and rush until`" , well you get the point.  Typically I'll grab coffee from home, I can make my own Starbucks there, either Keurig or a nice Chemex pour-over. But on many a pleasant Phoenix morning I'll want the real McCoy made by a trained barista.What makes this possible on a `"school day`" is the wonderful Starbucks app. I have my gift cards loaded, my favorites saved (lately an iced americano with a splash of coconut milk, venti of course). I highly recommend the sausage, cheddar and egg sandwich if you need a protein boost. Or you can mix and match by walking across the parking lot to B-KIng for one of those heavenly but horrible crosissandwichs, sausage please.  Guilt but happy.  The app has some sort of gamification to it that if you collect the stars, you earn free stuff.  I'm lucky to remember to check in on Yelp let alone game on my way in to work with my 2 gig memory.While I always grab and dash, (my order is always ready to pick up when I get there) I'd love to sit and chill and people watch or surf the net.  This location has a great vibe to it, sweet patio also.  I love that Starbucks has changed their approach and will allow anyone to use their Facilites even if you're not buying anything.Oh, BTW, speaking of grabbing and dashing, my apologies to whoever ordered the spinach wrap last week and ended up with my breakfast sandwich.  I think you got the better end of the bargain on that one.   Cheers!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 9, 2023~This Starbucks had great customer service! I had issues with my drinks from another Starbucks and explained what happened to this store and they gave me two free drinks to make up for the problem with my last order from another Starbucks.  Very friendly staff and super clean environment here.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 23, 2018~This is one of the closest Starbucks with a drive thru. Also there is 3 Starbucks just on happy valley less then 5 miles from each other. They have a patio to sit outside with umbrellas! It feels kinda tight inside cause it's kinda small.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~May 19, 2018~I'm not quite sure why this particular location manages to obtain such low reviews.  I've never had any issues here at all.  After dinner this evening, I ran up &amp; got a couple of Frappuccino's for an after dinner treat. I hit up the drive-thru &amp; there was only (2) cars ahead of me.  I read the previous reviews about how slow the drive-thru was prior to heading out to this Starbucks visit.  From the time I spit out my order until the time the nice girl at the drive-thru window handed me my drinks, a whopping 2 minutes and 43 seconds passed.  How do I know that?  ...because I timed it. [insert climatic theme music here]  I guess I'm not personally the kind of individual who feels that's a horrific amount of elapsed time.  Obviously, when it's 7:30 a.m. on a Monday morning and the amount of vehicles in the drive-thru are wrapping around the parking lot into the Safeway gas station - I can't imagine that most of you are blown away that it may take more than 2 minutes and 43 seconds to get your drink.  If by chance you ARE blown away by that fact, perhaps you should stick to brewing your coffee at home.  Just sayin'...Anywho... the interior of this Starbucks location is exceptionally clean.  The restrooms are clean and the Wi-Fi is fast.  None of the staff has ever been rude to me.  I've been inside of this Starbucks numerous times and have been through the drive-thru even more.  The staff has always been friendly, cordial, polite and I've never had an order screwed up in the least.  Like.  Never.  The location is convenient and simple to access.  My only [minor] gripe would be the parking lot situation.  It's fairly cramped, but it's simply due to the sheer volume of surrounding shops and stores in the adjacent strip mall.  When the drive-thru line does get lengthy, there isn't a good place for the vehicles to oozing out of the drive-thru to land.  They essentially spill out into the small parking lot that can land lock the patron's who have parked to go into the location.  But again, if you're attempting to park here on a Monday morning at 7:30 a.m. - well, you're tempting a fate that you already know the answer to.My Frappuccino's this evening were fresh, ice cold &amp; sweet... just like my Yelp reviews.  Just kidding.  Sorta.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jan 9, 2020~Odd Starbucks vibe. The staff are very unfriendly. They seem more interested in talking about customers then actually providing customer service. Ordering a drink takes a bit of patience. I usually have to repeat myself. So much for listening.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Apr 30, 2021~I have never had to wait in line at a drive thru as long as I did here. Holy crow!!  It took 20 min just to PLACE my order. Ugh. I go to Starbucks drive thru because it's usually super quick. What is going on here?!?  This is like IN N OUT. Dang. If the line is around the parking lot, DON'T BOTHER unless you have 45min to kill. Which I do not. And now I can't get out of line. Super frustrating.   This drink better be freaking glorious.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Dec 8, 2016~My go-to Starbucks since I like the drive-thru as well as location. The inside is very clean and a modern/rustic feel. They have a ton of tables inside and outside on small patio which makes it nice to hang out on your computer or a great meeting spot. This Starbucks is always busy especially the drive-thru! The line goes pretty quick but just make sure you give yourself enough time because there is usually at least 10cars in line every morning. The drinks are always good and exactly what I wanted. Everyone is always friendly as well and hyped up on caffeine by 6am. HA!Starbucks prices are pretty high for coffee but that is expected for convenience. I love the holiday drinks &amp; cups but they definitely can get expense. I try to just go 1-2 days a week or stop by to get a refreshing tea as that is fairly cheap. My favorites are Pumpkin Spice Latte, Carmel Macchiato Iced, Cold brew, Carmel Frappuccino, and Green tea.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jul 25, 2019~I'm bummed anytime I give a poor review. This Starbucks In particular has poor customer service. That's always the thing I care most about. Treating others well especially when it's a customer.  Being in the service industry myself that's one of my main focuses!! My sisters and I came for a nice coffee date. There were 5 of us and 3 of the 5 drinks were made wrong. We asked for each drink to be remade and we got no apology. They simply just took the drinks from us and remade it. One of our waters spilled and so we went to the front to get a cloth to clean it and get a new water and we were completely ignored. It was just disappointing that simple customer service wasn't practiced at this location as well as not being able to listen to our orders. I will probably not be returning to this location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Oct 1, 2019~This is the 3rd time I have ordered a pumpkin scone and banana bread from this location and they have been so dry and old. I get them for my grandkids and will not be going back here ever again. It's bad enough they charge 2.95 for a slice of banana bread, at least it could be fresh.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Sep 13, 2016~Stopped by here after work and got a tall double chocolaty chip frap and a chocolate croissant. The drive thru moved quick, it was around 2:30pm and whoever Will is that was working the drive thru... he is awesome! The reason I'm writing this is because he just had positive vibes coming across that little voice box when I was ordering. You can tell he loved what he was doing and that just put a smile on my face. Plus he told me I was in luck today because all desserts were a dollar. YES! (Not sure if it's a usual thing they do, but if so, I wouldn't have guessed because Will made my experience so personal! And what I loved is that he didn't ask me if I wanted my croissant warmed up or not, he just gave it to me warm! Thank you. (Who likes cold croissants with the chocolate chunky??? Not me) AND the best frap I've had so far, I don't know what they did but it was extra good.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jul 6, 2018~Always out of food. Never have the spinach feta wrap after 11 am and then none or few of the follow up choices. My drink is messed up about 50% of the time. I order SF vanilla latte but they make it skinny with nonfat milk even though I order it properly and the label is correct, they still consistently make it wrong. Drive through is always slow and going in is slower. Do t waste your time, go to the Starbucks in Safeway, a little less convenient but worth the walk inside!
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Mar 18, 2018~Worst Starbucks in the valley!!!! Unfortunately, I would come here for convenience. My yoga studio was steps away. The staff are rude, drinks sub-par, pastries like rocks. Honestly, I have been in customer service for years and have never witnessed such nasty attitudes. It's a cup of coffee and a smile. This should not be much to ask for considering the prices  and the very grounds (maybe- pun intended) that Starbucks was founded upon. A great cup of coffee from a friendly community barista. Honestly, if you cannot be consistently pleasant to EVERY customer, perhaps you would be better off not working with the public. I have had to take my drinks from this Starbucks to a different location to have them re-made to make them palatable!!!! I have spoken with the manager and district manager that tell me the problem will be corrected. So far, not so.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jul 25, 2019~I used to love this Starbucks. Unfortunately, the service has gone down hill. They haven't made my drink correctly in the last three visits and it's only iced tea with no sugar. People make mistakes but it's how they react to them that is very telling. I never receive a free drink, apology and they even act like it's a huge inconvenience to remake it. I don't think I'll be going back to this location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Sep 11, 2012~This is a good Starbucks experience with all the expected amenities of WiFi, good coffee, happy service and some great people watching. However, beware of the cranky barista. Although my mom can be a bit much on the drink customization, that's no need for an eye-roll and huff. I would chalk it up to a bad day (everyone has them, even if they're made in the Starbucks Barista Kitchen, where only happy people are born). However, I've heard her be a bit short and huffy with a few customers. Overall, a great Starbucks in a great location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 19, 2021~11-19-2021 Pulled up in the drive five minutes before closing time was told they were closed. I asked would it be too much to ask for a water. Was told they already shut down the system  I use to be a shift here years ago when we gave customers water. Also your `"system`" has nothing to do with water. Little insider secret, that's not how water works but I appreciate the lie.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 22, 2017~After watching a barista struggle to scrape stuff out of the blender using her hand and a desperate cup, then getting the wrong drink even after I clarified 3 times which one I wanted (basic, simple frappuchino), then when I did get the 'right' drink it looked completely different than what it ALWAYS looks like when I get it from other stores BUT one of the other baristas was condescendingly repeating that was the right drink this time. One of the baristas dumped mocha coated ice back into the main ice bin!The first time it wasn't even the same frappachino, and the guy taking my order said `"umm, ya we have a mocha drink`" when I asked for a dark mocha. Sounded like he had NO IDEA what was on the menu! Nobody bothered to check anything with anyone else either. They acted like I was a nuisance.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jun 30, 2020~Starbucks is a vibe. Starbucks is one of the few public spaces I feel comfortable (currently). Given everything that is going on right now, Starbucks feels like a safe space. Being on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona during this time doesn't feel great for me because most people here are just mad and racist. I sought out Starbucks and I am happy I did. The lady at the window was so welcoming and peaceful; the food/drink was on point; and there was just an air of, for lack of a better descriptor, love. Additionally, they are taking social/physical distancing very seriously. It would be nice if most stores/restaurants/etc. felt this way inside. I generally go to the Starbucks in Noe Valley (San Francisco) and they are very, very nice as well.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~May 27, 2017~I love this location. I have been going to this location for years. Always friendly staff. Drinks are yummy, fast and generally made correctly. Drive thru time is usually the longest wait. I generally mobile order unless I have my kids then I go inside where we enjoy our drinks and snakes. I recommend getting a raspberry mocha. My favorite is the chestnut praline latte but it is seasonal and not till November. Kids usually get frapps.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Oct 21, 2017~This was at the bottom of my iced coffee.  Curdled milk.  Did not notice it until I started to stir with the straw.  This Starbucks location has steadily declined in quality in their product and customer service.  Gross!   Here's hoping I don't get sick from drinking some of it.  Disappointed.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 26, 2020~Leah is amazing here!!!! I called yesterday to ask about free coffee offer for healthcare workers! She confirmed the offer and we all got a cup of coffee for the afternoon to finish our 13 hour shift sharper! Thank you!
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Jan 14, 2015~Thats a bummer that they move the Starbucks over here. :(But I love the drive thru here. Long lines, but it moves quickly.... sometimes. :) it's smaller than usual. Very clean, great bartista here.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Oct 30, 2019~Slowest Starbucks drive through I've ever been to. It's slow every single time I go no matter what time of day. I wait less at chick fil a with 20 cars in front of me than this Starbucks with 2 cars in front of me. You can seriously assume it's about 5-7 minutes per car. They need to change something in the way they do things.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~May 3, 2018~Worst service ever.  Old lady taking orders sure thinks she's here for us.  Like we are a nuisance.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Aug 3, 2018~The worst Starbucks probably in the world. Never have product, and terribly slow. Inside or drive thru, doesn't matter. Always slow. Hire more people and carry the damn turkey bacon sandwich.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 16, 2019~This morning Leah was absolutely terrible. I didn't know they this location was out of pumpkin so I asked for a minute to decide on a different beverage. She kept mentioning the line behind me. I ordered quickly and was taking to the brunette at the window when again Leah chimed in saying no we are just out and we're not getting it back. We weren't even talking about the pumpkin at this point. Extremely rude. Not going back to this location due to the experience with Leah herself.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jan 6, 2021~I come here every morning and the employees are fantastic!  Great customer service and if there is an issue they are happy to fix it and make your drink the way you want!  New machines have really helped eliminate bitter espresso too!  I am so hopeful they reopen soon!!!  Miss my morning smiles from them!!
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Mar 18, 2018~Sunday mornings are crazy busy here. Sometimes the line for the drive thru is too much. My last three visits I walk in, get my coffee, and walk out. The best is seeing the same people still in line for drive thru. The store is clean. My coffee is fresh n hot, and the staff are super friendly. Thanks for being my pre-church coffee supply. Keep up the awesome work and fast friendly service.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Mar 25, 2018~Would add a zero if possible! The drive thru line took 45 minutes to get through. The Sunday morning crew must be different than other busy morning crews -- I've always had great experiences on weekday mornings. This team was rude and seemed annoyed. Mobile orders were prioritized, which i don't usually mind, but when your car has been trapped in the drive thru for nearly an hour, it's frustrating to see people pull up, order on their phone, and then go grab their drinks within minutes.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Dec 16, 2017~I'm done with this Starbucks as they have gotten our order wrong too many times now, every other place does a good job I am so confused on why this one has, had so many mishaps with us. We always say iced drinks, this time we got the salted caramel mocha and the mocha macchiato no whip like always and they gave them to us hot. Whatever it is I hope they fix it and maybe I'll give them another shot like last time.
Glendale, AZ 85310~3~Nov 29, 2017~I have been to this Starbucks three times, the third time was because i wanted to give them another chance. The first two times they messed up my orders, luckily the third time was the charm and they got my girlfriend and mines order 100% right. So the first time we went my girlfriends coffee was correct and i had a coconut-milk mocha macchiato (no whip just in case)... I have literally zero idea on what they brought me and it came with whipped cream (another starbucks i went to said that drink doesn't even come with whip). So i said I didn't want whipped, they just took it off and all it tasted like mocha syrup and coffee. Then the second time, decided to spice it up and get a salted caramel mocha. Mine was right this time but my girlfriend got the chestnut praline (again we say no whip incase over and over again to make sure for both of them). Hers came out with whip cream, they were nice about it and remade it for her.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Feb 13, 2019~The vanilla bean frappuccino is my favorite  this Starbucks is always so clean and the service is always speedy quick.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Sep 22, 2020~The customer service here is pretty good but I hate to say if you want a good drink then go to the one up the road in norterra, you can really taste the difference
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Apr 1, 2012~Excellent service. Friendly staff. They always greet me by name. And my drink is made just the way I like it.The drive-thru is for me since I am typically making a run up to Starbucks to grab a morning coffee or an afternoon pick me up and have my three children with me. There is no denying that this is a very busy location with a drive-through that can often span quite a distance, typically the length of one row of parked cars. However, I've always waited regardless since the line seems to still move quite quickly unlike other locations I've been to. The staff doesn't amazing job at managing orders while still making you feel welcome and not rushed!It's also great to see familiar faces when I'm not a daily regular but still I'm treated as one!I believe it's the staff from the previous location about 1 mile south on pinnacle Peak Road. Which that location closed a few years ago and it's nice to still see some of the same barista's working in greeting you from years ago. If you are at Starbucks drinker and I don't have a rewards account with them than my advice would be to get one because the benefits are amazing and include free drinks or pastries etc. I'm not sure the requirements now for the gold card; however back when I joined into thousand 10 I believe it was every 12 purchases and you got a free drink plus other benefits such as free refills on their in-house coffee and teas. I'm not entirely sure now what that for benefits are except that after so many dollars being spent or purchases that you do you earn free drinks as well as various offers and discounts from being a Gold card member. I do want to clarify that this is not a credit card by any means but rather a gift card that you would register into your name and make purchases on that gift card for the points or rewards. The gift cards can be reloaded or refilled.  Which means it is not at all a credit card of sorts but rather a prepaid gift card that is being used for purchases. Because I for one would not be signing up for a credit card just to get some coffee ;-)
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~May 20, 2019~Always come to this location and always get my coffee order wrong. I ask for cream in my coffee and it always looks dark brown like barely any is in it. Every other Starbucks in the valley gets it right except this location. Coffee tastes almost burnt half of the time or they don't fill their drinks all the way. Very disappointed. Not the nicest workers either.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Sep 15, 2017~I rarely go to any Starbucks anymore. The quality of the coffee and the customer service just is not what it used to be but yet the prices are higher. Go figure. This location in particular though has been super disappointing to me the handful of times I've been in. Employees who clearly don't care if you're there or not and espresso based drinks that are bitter tasting and way too expensive. Although it's close to my home, I'm done going there. Will either make my drinks at home or make the longer drive to a Dutch Brothers location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Dec 15, 2016~Robert is a super amazing employee to have their at your Starbucks!! Always has a smile while working through the drive-thru it seems to be a perfect way to start my day!!
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Jul 18, 2015~This is by far, the slowest Starbucks in the country, possibly the world! Even the home shop in Seattle is faster. Wait of average 15min just about 95% of the time.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Aug 10, 2016~This place have a old lady that gives horrible service,I felt like she's discriminated against Asians, today I went in to order a drink,I said `"purple drink`" 3 times and she make it sound like she didn't understand what I said,I pretty sure I pronounced it right and my friend hear that when I first said it.Every Time I go, in this old lady gives me the worst service ever!
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Sep 2, 2017~Went in for a venti iced coconut milk mocha macchiato and first they made I sloppy and the second time they made it sloppy with so much goop at the bottom I got a mouth full my first sip and they didn't use coconut milk. They have had progressively worse service recently
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Dec 12, 2019~I have been going to this starbucks every weekday morning for about the last five years. I have seen a lot of change over there over the years. It seems like every since they lost Nancy the business has gotten much slower and the employees do not move very fast at all. I have to wait forever to get my drink even though hardly any customers are there. This morning I ordered a sugar free skinny cinnamon dolce iced latte and the first time it came out it was hot, so then they re-made it and the second time it was iced but not sugar free. I never write reviews but felt that this time it was necessary.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Mar 7, 2019~The breakfast sandwiches were gross. And we ordered a puppachino and the said you mean a cup of whipped cream. Just unnecessarily rude. And to top it off we had to ask for it two more times because they kept forgetting.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jan 12, 2019~Unfortunately, Starbucks service and coffee is going downhill fast. I go to Starbucks daily, I use the mobile app. It's about 50/50 if my order is ready. I even allow extra time. Now if the core employees are working, it's ready and correct but turnover at this location is very high. If I go on the weekend, forget it. I will order ahead allow extra time and it will be missing something like today. Two coffees, one breakfast sandwich. When I came, I was the only customer in the store and there were 5 employees. They were doing chores, like cleaning the espresso machine, refilling ice and talking to each other. None would acknowledge me at the counter and went out of their way to avoid me. I finally asked for assistance. `"Do you have my sandwich back there?`" I asked. `"I don't have a sticker for it`" was the reply. She finally yelled over to the girl in front of the ovens to put one in. The reply `"I don't have a sticker for it`". Someone finally checked the machine, it jammed and there it was. So presumably they popped sandwich in the oven, I waited another 5 minutes (now it's 15 minutes since I placed a mobile order that was supposed to be ready in 3-5min). I finally walk over and ask again, another woman comes out and says she's terribly sorry they are out of the sandwich I ordered. Well what happened to it, didn't someone put it in the oven. Oops! There it was still in the oven, a bit too brown too. It has now been 20 minutes since the mobile order placed. I told her this was not good service and I was particularly annoyed since the 5 employees chose to ignore me. She apologized said I could use her name next time and get a free coffee. I told her there was no way I was going to do that, number one that just seems odd to say and second I use the mobile app. She said she was sorry but she was a shift lead at another store and employees had called out today, the sticker machine jammed and she'd been at lunch. Well I guess it takes 5 people to finally serve 1 customer who pre-ordered when no other customers were in the store. The worst part was my husband's coffee was awful. It tasted very week and old. He had to run back up to the store after this. I called the corporate office after searching for the phone number (it has disappeared from both the app and their website they now want you to email) and a very bored woman said she'd `"forward this complaint`". To whom I don't know. She was a bit rude as well. In fact when I related all this to her she said `"I don't know what to say`". Starbucks, you need to maybe hire some better people or take the time to train them. Well service like this encourages me to no longer come. I probably need to kick this bad habit anyway! Coffee at home is suddenly sounding a lot better.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Nov 20, 2019~One of closest to my house, so always on radar before and after work! Crazy small parking lot for the drive thru.....can't get in or out if it's rush hours, but typically fast and accurate! Friendly staff at this location too.
Glendale, AZ 85310~3~Dec 28, 2016~Wrote my first review of this location  in 2015. Sadly, doesn't seem much has chnged. I think the staff are overwhelmed  with the column of traffic this place receives. I now go to safety in the smell area since they now have a Starbucks, no waiting and the drinks taste the sme.
Glendale, AZ 85310~3~Nov 16, 2015~No one in the dining room but yet I waited well over 15 minutes for my tea. The cashier could have helped what looked like the only person working, Instead she spent her time socializing with some guy. Super slow for no reason.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Mar 21, 2016~Terribly slow service EVERY TIME.. Doesn't matter what time of day..No such thing as picking up a quick coffee here. I got stuck in the drive thru once for 20 minutes with 2 cars infront of me and had to listen to my newborn cry the whole time. Quicker to go into Safeway and use their Starbucks.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Oct 23, 2013~This is a new location to me. The one on Pinnacle Peak closed. And, thank goodness because the service there was the worst. Mostly old ladies worked there and they were slower than molasses.But at this HV location the servers are younger, quick, and not wasting time when people are in a rush.Recommend it.Also has drive thru!
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Dec 18, 2015~I have tried this location several times, not a typical Starbucks. Never seems customer oriented, always closes early, sometimes with people at the door. We were told thirty minutes before they were to close, they would make our coffee but we would have to take it to go. Previous visit I asked for cream for my coffee, there was none out they came back with a gallon of milk and set it on the counter and walked away. They have lost my business.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 15, 2018~Love Starbucks! The staff is friendly, drinks are consistent and location is easy to get in/out. We love this location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Mar 11, 2018~been going to various starbucks for decades.  Loooooongest wait I have ever experienced.  Took 20 plus minutes for a pour over and  hot chocolate.  Grossly understaffed  must be very poor management on A Sunday.  will NEVER return to this store.  Everyone very frustrated.  IGNORED people inside and concentrated on drive through.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Sep 22, 2015~I love how close this location is to us however it is the slowest moving and always good us my order. This morning, it was SLOW yet again, both our Venti coffee lattes were Luke warm, not even hot and the worst part they were BOTH 3/4 full!!
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Nov 2, 2015~So I hit a Starbucks every single day of the week.  I normally get my order to go or go through the drive thru. This was my first time at this location and it will be the last time. They were not busy inside but all of the tables were dirty. I had to wipe off my own table and chair. And it was so cold inside you needed a parka. It was actually warmer outside where it is 65°. Very disappointing for a Starbucks fan.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Sep 5, 2018~Super friendly but SO slow. Even if I'm the only person if the drive thru, it takes on average six minutes for me to get my drink. And it's always just a drink. It doesn't matter what time of day either.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Dec 18, 2018~I had a not great experience about 9 months ago. I have gone back several times and this Starbucks has been great! They have been quick, friendly and everything has been really good.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Jan 22, 2018~I'm disappointed today in this Starbucks. I have several times come in before and asked for a clean blender as I do not like the fall and winter flavors. Today they could not make my drink for 5 minutes as they had no available blender and it would take 5 minutes to clean one. There were barely any people there. When I said never mind she replied yah. The other times I have been met with no problem. It came across as she didn't want to be bothered with my special order.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Dec 17, 2016~I was hoping for improvement of this location before writing this review, but I believe it's not going to happen...First, let me say that I believe the staff doesn't want to be rude on purpose, rather, they can't help it because they are so totally OVERWHELMED and unprepared for the amount of traffic (both walk-in and drive thru) at this location.I can't recall in recent memory walking out of there thinking...`"what great service`"...rarely, if ever do I see someone smile when I stop in.The store is dirty and not properly cleaned up, again, probably due to amount of traffic.There is definitely a management shortfall in this store.Sooooo...my wife and I now walk in to the Safeway Starbucks (co-located in the same parking lot) to get our coffees in a calm and peaceful environment.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Feb 28, 2016~This place is disgusting. There is trash all over the floor and in the bathroom, the trash cans are all overflowing, the baristas are talking loudly and negatively about customers and there is no seating.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Jun 26, 2016~The only reason this location gets the second star is because of the occasional nice employee!  I drive all over the Phoenix area and this is the only location bringing question about charges incurred ...by that I mean, I always get the exact same thing at every Starbucks and it always costs a little more at this location!  To top it off the website says they close at 9:00pm and they actually close at 8:30pm.  The bitter old lady starts giving you a warning every 5 minutes the last half an hour just to remind you!  Looks like Happy Valley Town Center will be getting my business from now on.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Sep 5, 2018~I love this Starbucks! The young people working there are a lot of fun! I especially like John. His dry humor cracks me up! What happened to One? He was the other sweetheart barista that also always made my day!
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jan 9, 2016~Terrible terrible customer service at this location! Waited for over 15 minutes for a latte! Which would not have been a big deal but of the 5-6 people working there ONE girl was actually busy. The kid at the drive thru was texting, the older lady at the register was standing off to the side talking to two employees that had already clocked out and another girl was taking a break. There were 4 people in the store total, 2 were waiting on drinks. Unbelievable....I felt bad for the one girl who was actually working her tail off making drinks. Never again at this Starbucks.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~May 22, 2013~The location on Pinnacle Peak has closed, but there is a new one just up the street on Happy Valley &amp; 39th Dr. It has a drive-thru!
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~May 20, 2017~This Starbucks is super friendly in the morning, but the afternoon lot is kind of the worst
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Nov 14, 2014~Slowest SB ever!  The staff spends too much chatting and they placed, what seems to be the least experienced person, on the register in the morning rush.  It took her 10 minutes to ring up 2 ppl.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 29, 2010~Been a Starbucks customer for many years and this is the local store by our house and they are the best.  No matter how long the line, the wait time is always quick and the drinks are always right.  They are a chipper group and make the visit personal and enjoyable.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Jun 19, 2015~I like this one because it has a drive-thru--which is pretty much always packed. But the location and way it's situated is awkward. Cars will back the drive thru line up and block people in their spaces instead of getting off their fat butts and walking in. Always busy, generally fast, always good service.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Oct 21, 2014~I've been to many starbucks locations but this one is my favorite right now. In the mornings it does get a lot of traffic and it does take longer to get to the window. But my coffee always tastes good. Anything I get always has the right flavors that I like. They do know how to make good coffee and the staff is really friendly
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 25, 2019~This has been my `"home`" Starbucks for years and I've always had great experiences.  That has changed in the recent past.  Personally, I think it started when the mobile order app took off.  There is no longer a priority for people waiting in line at the store.  Over the past few months the wait time in the drive through has become ridiculous.  This morning's wait was the last straw for me and I will no longer even attempt to go through here anymore.  This morning I noticed the drive-thru line was fairly short so I decided to stop on my way to work.  I was the 4th vehicle in line (including the one at the window).  I ordered two Americanos, black.  I waited 22 minutes with the last 5 minutes at the window after I had paid!  UNACCEPTABLE STARBUCKS!  They really need to rethink their priorities and get things moving again or they are going to lose a lot of business.  I don't know anyone that has 20+ minutes to give up on their way to work for a simple cup of joe.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Mar 7, 2015~My teas were fine - but the staff member who helped me was really rude, will not be coming to this particular Starbucks again. Long brunette girl with glasses - learn some customer service, thx!
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Jul 3, 2017~Rudest SB I've been to in a long time. A smile, at least, goes a long way. Very slow too. I expect to wait while my drink is being made but I was the only one in there when I ordered.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Jun 2, 2017~This Starbucks seemed to have issues.  Each item was called for pick up one at a time.  So the danish that was warmed was cold by the time the coffee was ready.  The tables were dirty.  The bathroom,  the floor was black with shoe prints , the trash can was over flowing (as was the one in the main area), and there was no toilet paper.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 5, 2016~I agreed with Tiffany H. the old lady worked in this location was horrible.  She gave me terrible service every time I stopped there.  She needs to work on her customers service skill!
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Apr 17, 2015~Absolutely aweful store will NOT return. Drive through service is very unpleasant.  Employees give us a tall size when we asked for a grande and gives us next to no cream when we asked. Tasted aweful and aweful customer service will not recommend to anyone will not return. If I could give fewer stars I would.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Feb 18, 2012~A great Starbucks store with fantastic service! Twice now have asked for decaf in the early afternoon and was given a huge surprise!! This place rocks ;)
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Oct 28, 2013~It's the same friendly staff that was at the old Starbucks on 39th and Pinnacle. They make everything perfect! Every now and then they have gotten my drinks mixed up but they happily fix it!
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Jul 14, 2016~Truly terrible service. I literally lost money because they just didn't give me what I ordered, then all they had to say was, `"oh, sorry.`"
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~May 30, 2016~My mom and I stopped by to pick up drinks to go....we went inside since the drive thru line looked long. We're pretty understanding since we knew the drive thru was busy and there was only -one- barista making drinks. Even though there was one employee strictly taking drive thru orders and two other employees off to the side just socializing. I'm not sure how this particular Starbucks manages work flow but it appeared the one lone barista could have used some assistance. I noticed the average wait time was beginning to flash red for the drive thru as well. Eventually my drink was made but then the girl completely forgot my mom's drink. Which became obvious when the couple who ordered quite sometime after us got both their drinks. We saw a drink sitting in the blender which we realized was my mom's. The girl at one point appeared to recall the drink, blended it a few more times and then forgot it again making other drinks. When we notified another employee about the situation she asked if we would still want to taste it to see if it was ok....we politely asked for it to be remade. When we finally got the drink...there was no service recovery or anything. I work in service industry as well and the very least I was looking for was a `"sorry about the wait.`" Literally nothing. A quick stop turned into a 15-20 min wait. I hate writing negative reviews but this was pretty disappointing since my mom was getting upset and we ended up being late to an appointment. Drinks were on average and as expected.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Jul 7, 2016~So far my worst experience at a Starbucks. I ordered a venti coffee with room for cream. I had to have them pour some out. When I went add cream and sugar I found ants crawling on the counter. When requesting the pouring out of the coffee I was greeted with a frown.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jan 9, 2016~Worst Starbucks yet.  Rude and argumentative staff, told no black tea and cold oatmeal.  The parking lot was full of trash.  Several people turned the patio into an off leash dog park.  Never again.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Oct 14, 2017~I've been to this location many times and I've never been disappointed. However, this morning was an entirely different story. I work on some Saturday's and I usually have to be there by 5am, so I make sure I stop at this location for a quick coffee since they open at 4:30am. I've done this many times with absolutely no problems. I pulled into the drive through this morning at 4:45 and waited for the employee to take my order. I think I sat there for two minutes in complete silence before finally pulling up to the window to see if anyone was there. I pull up, and there's two employees just completely ignoring me. Finally, one of them looks at me, holds up her hand to signal that I need to wait 5 minutes and then walks away. I had to be at work by 5am so I obviously couldn't do this. Now, I completely understand running behind, It's 4 in the morning on a Saturday. But to completely ignore me? They were supposed to be open 15 minutes before my arrival and how hard would it have been to put on the headset, tell me they're running behind and need 5 minutes? I'm so disappointed in the customer service. I've never had a problem here before and I come around the same time every Saturday morning. Im very disappointed.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Dec 7, 2024~Great service I had $10 in Apple Pay and I tried paying and didn't work this kind lady said it was fine she can get it on the house for me
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 9, 2024~I haven't ordered from here in so long but couldn't pass it up seeing sometimes they have deals such as $6 for grande handcrafted drink with pastry. What a steal. Normally it's on Fridays. Staff were super friendly and helpful. I ordered the matcha with lavender cream and pumpkin spiced pepita. Both tasted great. It's $1 more to upgrade to venti.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Nov 8, 2019~Love this Starbucks. It's clean, friendly staff and near the house. Plenty of seating inside and outside. I usually order my usual chai latte and they've always gotten it right. Some places it is too milky. Normally i ride my bike here and chill for few hours. I'm sure it'll get busier now the weather is nice.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Aug 7, 2024~I went to this location and got two large Matcha and even tipped the woman taking my order I was disappointed to find out when I got my drinks that there was green big huge chunks in my drink.  I paid $14 for a drink that assaulted my throat with green slop.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Apr 10, 2020~Located inside Safeway! Only one open! Went to 2 other locations but they were closed. Got the iced white mocha. Yummy!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 18, 2021~This is one of best Starbucks locations. They are so quick and efficient even though they have so many customers every morning. Lexi is one of the best baristas too, she's so nice and kind and remembers my order everytime. Thank you guys for being a bright spot during this pandemic!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jan 8, 2021~Always have great service, never an issue with our orders. You whiny people complaining about your coffee, stay thr hell home and make your own cry=asses!Give the kids a breK!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Dec 1, 2019~I go to this location 2-3 times a day (I know it's an unhealthy addiction) abyways, It's finals week and I work across the street from it as well almost everyday. After my shift, I came home and realized how much homework I had around 8:15 PM and decided to order a coffee, I felt really bad about it because it was within 30 minutes before their close but I needed it for my long night. ANYWAYS long story short, when I got there I sat down and the drink wasn't made yet, which was fine because it was only 5 minutes since I ordered. After waiting a little bit, one of the employees asked if I did a mobile order because they never received one, it was now 8;25 or so and I said yes but no big deal I don't need one its not urgent... they insisted on making my drink and were so kind and positive and I felt awful because I didn't even have my card or cash to tip them. They seriously were so kind and uplifting and it made my week. I literally made a yelp account just to write this, if either of you see this thank you soooo much you both deserve a promotion. One was blonde and one was brunette and they were both young. Okay THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 4, 2024~This is one of my favorite locations. The customer service is outstanding!  They are so nice and friendly. My order is always perfect! I've always been satisfied when ordering from this location.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 17, 2023~This is why I've switched to Dutch bros...I walked up to the counter to order and the barista whispered `" oh my fucking god `" rolled her eyes and just stared at me, I ordered my drink and patiently waited for it to come out.. she continued to complain behind the counter about not wanting to be there &amp; disliking her job.. my drink came out but she didn't call it out or say here are your drinks.. I wasn't sure it was mine so I asked, she ignored me.. my drink honestly sucked. As I was leaving a said to her (kind of loudly as both baristas had an attitude) `"I hope your day gets better `" she rolled her eyes and I left.The whole experience was very bad. Every time, specifically this location, the service &amp; drink quality are significantly BELOW par. I will NOT shop at this frys or Starbucks any more. This was at 4:54 pm, I get they were probably getting ready to close however that is unacceptable behavior and if you truly dislike your job THAT much, maybe it's time to find a new one. This is not the first time I've ordered drinks from her and not the first time she's been awful to the customers.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jun 3, 2023~These have to be the most unfriendly, rudest girls in any Starbucks that I've ever been in. Des and Sid and dark hair girl in braids that throws everything around while mumbling to herself something she's bitchin about and could care less how you want your drink. Every time I'm in there I hear them talking shit about the company and you can just tell they hate their jobs. They need to get out there and find something that more suits them instead of making me feel like crap for ordering a drink that comes out right about 1 in 4. Summer and Cat are super sweet and friendly and always make me feel welcome.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 9, 2022~Really slow and not friendly. Not busy. Will not try this Starbucks again vs the standalones
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Nov 13, 2021~Worst customer service. The girl working right now, was upset I ordered 4 Frappuccino's and then was slamming things while making them. She didn't label any of them and just tossed them on the counter and walked away she didn't call out to what they were and when I tried to ask what one of them was she walked away and rolled her eyes. She needs to be fired, she shouldn't be working in customer service.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Nov 8, 2020~I honestly hate writing negative reviews but I couldn't help to write this. One of the major reasons I go to Starbucks over every other coffee shop, is because of the good and positive attitude of the barristas. This Starbucks has to have the WORST customer service I've ever encountered. I've been here multiple times, thinking it's just maybe a bad day. But the employees are slamming things around, rolling their eyes, acting like it's a total inconvenience for you to be there ordering coffee. I mean she was entering our order in the machine and basically slapping the register while entering it. Today was the last straw. I walked up the counter and got the deer in the headlights stare. I asked her, I'm sorry were you ready to take my order? She said umm yea. Like I was supposed to know she was ready. Then she rolled her eyes yet again. Slammed her pen down on the counter. She looked at me as if I did something wrong. And just told her never mind and walked away. I was so irritated, I couldn't even finish shopping in the grocery store. I left and went to the fry's I normally go to. I go to this fry's because it's on the way home from work. I will never go back to this Starbucks or even the grocery store. They ruin the whole Starbucks `"appearance. If you don't like you job, quit! There will be ser real others waiting for it. You are there to serve your customers. Not to act like we are an inconvenience to you and bothersome. Really a crappy feeling.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 23, 2020~Usually the service is good here but sometimes it isn't. I waited 15 minutes to get one iced coffee because what I originally tried to order ( which was on the menu ) they didn't have. When I finally got my iced coffee it wasn't that good. I'm just gonna start going to blackrock and Dutch bro's now most likely.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Nov 11, 2020~The lady at Starbucks in Frys is just simply rude and extremely discourteous with me and my family. I don't know if she's always like this with others, but she might be racist towards my family and I, which is Hispanic and the coffee is ok, but the way she treats us is simply undiplomatic and insulting. Don't go to that location if I were you.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 8, 2024~They have short lines and clean service nice and very good seating area for the store and also good grocery store 5 star
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Nov 10, 2024~It is a good drink good service and in groceries store but close early but good good good
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Nov 11, 2024~Every time I order something at this store and pick it up, it's wrong, or something is missing. It's coffee. Like literally it's just coffee and limited food options. It's not hard. I'm not doing anything wrong. It's you. Just try to act like you understand basic transactional process. Demonstrated a tiny bit of customer service. That's all. Starbucks: try....just try to hire competent people. Try. Also I order on the app, pick up my stuff, and am told they don't sell one of the things listed on the app, like ever, and to call a number for a refund. Are you kidding?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 29, 2024~This Starbucks inside Target Get's It.The Menu is More Eclectic than in the Past!. There are more menu items that Healthier and in stock like Egg-Bites. MyFavorites are Potato , Cheddar and Kale and Mushroom. Love to spend time here with Friends. Helpful Barista's that Go The Extra Mile!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 21, 2024~This is our `"go to`" place. Since we live across the street, it's very convenient. We know everyone here and they usually have our drinks ready before we even order them. Everyone here is very nice.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 13, 2024~The lady who took my order, tawny, was very sweet and polite!! She had a wonderful attitude which would make me come back.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 18, 2023~Marc was the best associate at that Starbucks location! He was very cordial and assisted me with my passion fruit lemonade drink. Would go again!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 20, 2019~They can't seem to get my order right, which is a `"Salted Caramel Cold Foam Cold Brew w/ a shot of white chocolate moca.`" I have been here three times and the issue always has to deal with the way they do their cold foam. I have got this same order numerous times at the Camelback Inn resort, the bell &amp; Tatiana location and the one by ASU, and have never had this problem. The issue is that their cold foam is watery, disintegrates 5 minutes after receiving the drink, and on two occasion the cold foam wasn't even sweet in the slightest. One time I even asked them to make sure the cold foam was made from sweet cream and they ended up trying to give me a completely different drink. I just hope they can change this, maybe they could coordinate with some of the other mentioned locations to see where they are messing up at when making the drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 29, 2022~Best service by far. Very nice and patient. Hayley was very helpful, she's the sweetest. My drink was very well made just what I asked for. I also purchase some merchandise. Thank you again will be back soon.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 1, 2020~I went into get a mobile order. That I could see was ready. And not one person acknowledged me. I get that everyone was busy. But 3 different baristas were facing me and made eye contact with me but just looked away and it took the guy on the complete other side to come help me. But as soon as a guy walks in without a mask he got acknowledged by all 3 of the baristas to put a mask on same ones that couldn't even say hi or help me. I know these are hard times for everyone and I do not like writing a negative review but for someone who is in the industry this was very disappointing.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jun 29, 2020~The employees are rude and never get my order right. They only give me short straws and everytime i ask them for right size straw they get mad. They completely messed up my entire order and i didn't realize it until i got home. They are also really slow and i am a partner at a different store and i try to understand that they are super busy and i didn't let it upset me but this has happened almost every single time i have gone to this starbucks since corona happened.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Oct 14, 2024~Always a great Starbucks to chill at and have a nice tea. Staff is awesome and friendly.I hit them up on my way up to Flagstaff for a break from driving!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 2, 2024~Not your average Starbucks. This location has a conference room that seats about 10 in a private room. You're able to make a reservation and rent it out free of charge. I chose to do work in there on a Friday. W. Also, free entertainment. A dude on something came into the store walking in half dressed and another dude was passed out cold falling out of his chair. Coffee is fine as always. Not the best, not the worst. Recommend cafe Misto, similar to a cafe Olay
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Dec 9, 2024~Well well well! Who knew Starbucks still existed as a place to actually sit inside and meet with friends. Cozy tables, light music playing. This is a good one considering how some have totallyGone to drive thru only.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jul 8, 2024~i absolutely loved this starbucks, its literally next door!! my apple pay wasnt working and they gave me a free one ughh and i was already having a bad morning, the workers were too freakin sweet!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jan 19, 2024~I came in today for my mom's birthday to get her free drink. Adrian was the best help ever, I will be coming back to this location. He was very sweet and helpful 10/10!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 20, 2023~I highly recommend going to the Starbucks on tatum and shea. It's extremely clean and organized.The staff is absolutely amazing! We had the pleasure of meeting Sox today. He was friendly, kind and knowledgeable. My daughters asked for super annoying tik tok drinks and he was so sweet and helpful.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 3, 2023~This is an awesome Starbucks inside a large Safeway. There is more seating than  usual at a supermarket location and it's comfortable and out of the way of supermarket shoppers; so it's more relaxing.Service is excellent. The Barista was friendly and professional.There is plenty of parking in the large shopping center lot. The Safeway closes at 10pm so I was able to sit in the Cafe area until then enjoying a pizza from Peter Pipers across the way and my Starbucks coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 2, 2024~Service by unhappy, sour dud!  The drink had sticky substances on the side from the way she put it together. If I see her behind the counter again, I will will not go there. I'm gonna stop at Black Rock to get my coffee for shopping from now on. I've always had friendly, special attention  from Regina but since she left, they're just grabbing the first person off the street to help.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jun 17, 2017~I am an extremely loyal Starbucks customer; daily, sometimes twice.  For the past 5 days, I have been ordering the Matcha Lemonade and it has been delicious!  However, today I got a drink that was clearly made with very little effort!  It had LARGE clumps of the powder at the bottom, raw powder sitting right on top of the ice, and even more powder sitting on top of the OUTSIDE of my lid!! It tasted terrible, even after rinsing the lid and mixing thoroughly.  I'm very disappointed and would like to advise that the baristas take effort with all drinks, but particularly those they are promoting for charity!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 14, 2020~REGINA, wow what a gem. A one minute experience with her made my day. Please don't every change, you're energy is infectious. She treated everyone in that line like we were family. THAT is what customer service is about.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jan 24, 2018~I love the convenience of this location!  Also-they serve the warm sandwiches-a plus in a grocery store location.  Plenty of clean tables in an open seating area!  Cawfee and groceries! One stop shopping!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 28, 2017~Always great service, friendly staff, timely and correct drink orders.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 13, 2015~I just fast tested Dunkin donuts coffee compared to my triple shot Carmel machiotto. Idk how DD even sells coffee with a Starbucks nearby! Definitely worth it.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 24, 2024~If i could leave 0 stars i would. This Starbucks is awful and the employees are rude. Its the closest one to my job so i have had the unfortunate pleasure of dealing with them on more than one occasion. The worker `"Jen`" yelled at me from across the whole store. They always make my drinks wrong as well. I will NEVER be coming back. Especially after condescendingly being told to `"have a nice day`"
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 25, 2024~Consistency and quality of drinks have significantly gone down! Used to come regularly to this location, but will be looking for a new one. Drive-through is always a long wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 18, 2023~This place is a joke. I came to get a pink drink. I usually get no ice and no strawberries. Never had a problem at other ones. This location however, said they need to start charging for ice and strawberries. Then handed me a tall cup with less than half of a pink drink. Still charged full price. And when they handed it to me. The ladies who worked inside were all looking at the window and smiling like idiots
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 7, 2023~Worst drive through- took 20 minutes to pick up my order. It almost felt like a hostage situation as you can't leave the line. The staff seemed to have no sense of urgency even it was taking them 20+ minutes for pick up!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Dec 12, 2020~Nice clean starbucks I always come to visit if I am in Scottsdale. Nothing more to say!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 23, 2023~I went here and ordered a black tea lemonade and they put no lemonade in it . it was so bitter and I went back in to ask them to add lemonade and spilled the drink and then they accused me of just wanting a refill!!!! are you kidding me never going here again. also the 2nd one tasted like sh*t too. very rude workers and waste of money.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 10, 2023~Do NOT visit. If going through the drive through, the odds are, you will get the wrong order. I love my triple espresso and plan ahead for the mornings I would like them. Then, I'm given chai tea lattes packed with junk. Not even close to a triple espresso. It is NOT worth the disappointment.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Mar 13, 2018~Usually I come thru the drive thru at this place. But today I came inside. It was pretty busy. I feel like this Starbucks has more seats then other ones. Also their bathrooms are gender neutral. They also have plenty of seats outside to sit as well. They seriously picked a good spot for their location because it's super busy on bell &amp; it's next to five guys which is super delicious. They have coffee, teas, snacks &amp; etc. My favorite is the caramel frappacino. Sign up for Starbucks rewards to get points for a free drink &amp; a free drink on your birthday.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 28, 2023~the works are all so slow and make everyone wait in line for atleast 15 minutes, they tend to always mess up our orders whether it be food or drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 23, 2023~Terrible customer service they make your drink wrong and talk bad about you behind the counter when you ask for it to be remade. Will never go back to this location. The guy up front with the thick black glasses should be fired.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Apr 25, 2019~Wow, the crew must be exhausted from a busy day. 15 minutes and still waiting for a small vanilla frappuccino for my daughter. They trashbins at the straw station are overflowing, there's tons of trash on the floor.4 staff members that look to be teenagers working the entire back. I would continue my review but finally got our drink. Oh and the bathroom I went into, had a filthy toilet seat - gross
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 7, 2023~my oder had gotten messed up really bad on my end which was not their fault at all, however they were very patient , remade my whole oder and then a worker named Dawn helped me carry my order out to my car ! the customer service they displayed was impeccable, however especially Dawn; she was so kind and really went above and beyond to help me and it really showed me that kind people still exist !!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 6, 2019~Not impressed my Starbucks cup was half full for the third and last time. I don't have time to let you do it again. But this keeps happening and is systemic. I will get my coffee from another location from now on.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 1, 2020~Today and yesterday was a bad tasting coffee  day. Yesterday cinnamon dolce tasted weak. I thought I would order a different drink today with an add shot. The drink was bland and no add shot. I explained to the drive through young man about my drink yesterday and his response was.. it's a hit or miss. REALLY! No empathy at all. Since I wasn't happy with my drink I went inside to talk to a manager whom refunded my cost. Bottom line is I will not be going back to this location again.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Oct 1, 2018~Positives:  One of few Starbucks in the area that have comfortable chairs to sit in.  For that reason alone I will be back.  The young man working was very friendly.Negatives: They do not have a nitro machine.  The older lady working wasn't very friendly and did not use my reward (that was expiring that day) like I asked her to for the purchase of my Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew.  Noticed (luckily) and ordered a hot breakfast sandwich to use the reward.  Did not hear when the sandwich was done so sat waiting 10 minutes for it and then ate it mostly cold.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Mar 6, 2019~Nice big Starbucks with lots of tables. It wasn't particularly crowded when I arrived and there was one or two people in line. It took 10 mins from the time I payed (with my app so I had the time stamp) to get my grande iced mocha without any customization. That's slow even for a busy Starbucks which this one was not.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 23, 2021~Horrible customer service. Jen, the manager (I assume based on being the only one in a different outfit) is arguably the least friendly or helpful manager to ever work at a Starbucks. She is never helpful and today I went in with an issue with an order and one of the baristas was helping. Jen proceeded to tell this person to not help me (I was the only one standing there) and didn't help me herself and instead told the person helping me to send me to the line to get help from the front. Literally didn't even say anything to me and then proceeded to stand around while I waited for the person at the register to help. It's no wonder this place has such horrible reviews with a manager like this running the place.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 6, 2019~This Starbucks store was not on Yelp.com when I went to search for it, but its been here for around 10 years according to some of the employee's. I never liked Starbucks, that is until I came here. The staff is very friendly and super speedy at getting people their orders. They use dealdash.com and many people order before arriving and I've never seen anyone wait in ordering through dealdash. They walk in, grab their food and drinks already waiting for them at the counter, and are out the door in seconds. The manager Ben is a super friendly young man and as I have managed many different businesses, he has to be one of the best I know. The barista's here are so friendly, you might think your not on planet earth when you visit this place. Kinda strange but very pleasing.. lol. I hang out here quite often and have gotten to know not only the staff but many of the regulars who come in, and its always nice to sit down, relax, enjoy the wifi and coffee, and check out the sites. Its better than sitting at home, but yet it feels like home and the staff make sure you have a great experience.This one place has changed my whole opinion and outlook about Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 8, 2021~Come here for every night for drinks but the girls are a big bonus. Same drink every day caramel frappucino always fast and the girls always ask how I am doing. Love you haha
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 30, 2020~I only come to the Starbucks because it's within walking distance. The employees are always rude and defense when you ask to remake a drink you've had for years. The store manager has the same attitude. Also don't grab a mask without asking, even though they're displayed right in front of you and easily accessible.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 10, 2019~I get the same drink at Starbucks because it's the ONLY drink I like. At this location I've received the drink wrong 100% of the time. Idk why I keep going back thinking I'll get the correct one, I think that's the definition of an idiot.... anyway, the store manager was probably the worst to ask have remake it, so try to avoid this location- it just stinks it's the closest one to my home.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Dec 16, 2015~I really don't know what all the bad reviews are about. I receive great service every time. The staff is friendly and competent. Whether I drive through or go in I never have a problem. This store seems to be a bit on the small side compared with some of them. Due to the location, though, there's nothing they can do about that. It can fill up pretty quickly, but I haven't had a problem finding a seat. And let's face it, if you can't find a seat in a Starbucks, there's always another one right around the corner!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 9, 2021~Do NOT recommend this starbucks. Each time I've went they have gotten my order wrong and the vanilla sweet cream cold foam tastes and has the same texture as water.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 11, 2021~I love this Starbucks location because of Mackenzie. She  knows my drink and is always in a great mood. She usually works in the early hours and is great with customers. There is never an issue at this location and the service is always fast !!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~May 16, 2015~This has become my `"GO TO`" Starbucks location. It is fairly new so in the beginning there were some hiccups I imagine with Customer Service.....but I believe all that is a thing of the past now. I enjoy the abundance of indoor and outdoor seating......the customer service is very good but could be just a little faster especially when there always seems to be enough people working. The establishment is well lit and very clean and despite the fact that it is in a strip mall per say the parking is pretty decent. This location has a drive-thru which I have yet to experience but I am sure it is fine as well since I have never really seen a long line here.I know Starbucks is not for everybody but if your live near this location I think it is worth stopping by. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 7, 2019~Always a good experience  some locations you go to and its just not up to par. If I was any to throw away 10 dollars on coffee, I better be he getting the full experience which includes outstanding customer service. These ladies and gents always deliver and I can't  thank you enough
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 22, 2017~I just have to say this has to be one of the most unfriendly Starbucks I have ever visited. The Starbucks never says hi when you walk through the door. They never have just regular coffee ready. I can say this will be the last time I shop at this particular Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 22, 2019~I went there today at 6 PM I want to work your name Lena she serve me and I said I want a hot chocolate she said OK I waited there one hour till it was Maurice like we're working on it and like all this worker like bitch give me to me right now what the fuck at her you she said no I'm like what is it what is your said no no no no what what witchcraft Scott the fuck up
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 8, 2017~Classic starbucks.  This place is clean and there was not really much of a wait.  The cashier was kind of cute too.  Today I gave in again to sugar and let them work there magic.  I was handcrafted a frappucino that tasted like kit kat.  It was on point and worth the 4 billion calories I'm sure comes with it. My only regret was not getting a double shot.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 8, 2019~I've been inside this Starbucks and it is very nice and spacious. There is lots of seating available inside and outside. The drive-thru is their downfall. I got in line at 10:00 and didn't exit the line until 10:21.  Given that most people are on their way to work this should be a lot faster. And being I am headed to downtown Phoenix this is making me late. If I wanted to wait in line forever I would go to Dutch Bros, where they are at least a lot nicer.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 25, 2015~Super weird starbucks. Asked for one of those carbonated bevs. Dude says they r out of bubbles but i can have a flat version (?!) blechWeird guyI forgot how strange this location isAnd worse some crappy mother was letting her toddler scream nonstopI will miss my eardrums.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 28, 2019~This is the worst Starbucks ! Very dirty tables that are stained white due to the faulty mist machine that barely works. Dirty bathrooms ! Just discussing and an embarrassment for the corporation, especially since it's located in Scottsdale.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 26, 2017~This is the absolute slowest Starbucks in the world. I've never waited so long every time I drive thru.  I won't go back.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Nov 12, 2016~Definitely the slowest Starbucks in the valley. I've never gone through the drive thru in less than 20 minutes and regret it every time.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 14, 2018~I come to this Starbucks I kid you not every morning  and they somehow mess up my drink almost every other day. It's simply a grande iced white mocha with no whip... apparently that's super hard to comprehend
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 6, 2020~This is to commend a very special young woman named Destiny Rosa for her excellent services and kind disposition with us the customers. What I noticed about this young woman Destiny is that she is always attentive and willing to go the extra mile in the delivery of her services. Her desire to please the customers she is taking care is immediately shown through her beautiful smile and kind greetings. I had observed Destiny to be very efficient and very multitask and no doubt she has the skills of a true leader in that she finds time to assist her new coworkers in the delivery of the services or in any preparation of the drinks we consume there. I want to congratulate Starbucks for hiring Destiny and for allowing her to make a difference in our day to day business with her kind smile and great services. She should be commended for it.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 4, 2019~Best Starbucks in all of Arizona!!!  They make the perfect cappuccinos, lattes and iced teas.  You guys rock!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 16, 2016~Worst location of Starbucks ever customer service is the poorest. Not only do you have to wait a long time because they do not make your drink as you order but you do not get what you ordered.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 28, 2018~Nice cashier but this place is filthy.  Baristas behind the bar are surly and fighting with each other.  Flies EVERYWHERE. Dirty floor, dirty tables, bathrooms did have soap and TP but that's the only nice thing I have to say. Thank goodness there are other choices, won't be back.  It's gross here. Did I mention the flies? Disgusting. Where I live we're surrounded by horses and I don't have flees like this.  Gag.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 27, 2018~Went through drive-thru 5 minutes ago. Just watched a dude pause from making my latte to grab a sandwich out of his pocket and take 2 bites hanging his head over my drink so nobody in the lobby could see. I'm letting the foam go down so I can see how many bacon gouda egg crumbs are floating in there.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 17, 2017~This is the slowest Starbucks! If it wasn't close to my house I wouldn't come. The typical wait for my order is at least 15 minutes. And half the time my order isn't right. Ugh!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 16, 2016~The slowest Starbucks ever!! It's the closet to my house but so slow all the time! Doesn't matter if you are the only person in line.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 23, 2016~Very poorest SB location. For a relative newly custom built site, no reason for its poor conditions. Dirty tables in and out windows not been cleaned in months?  . Flys everywhere inside. Slow service poorly staffed store. Expect when I pay more than $10 on two mid size drinks a lot more to enjoy while I sit and relax. Had to leave before we were done. Will not return. Where is the management these prices would pay for?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Nov 14, 2017~I've only been to this location once, but they were very nice and got our drinks right. It was closing time so they gave us a free cake pop they were going to throw out anyway which was really nice! Idk why this place has bad reviews.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 16, 2017~What others said. Slowest. Starbucks. Ever. How much time do you have and how badly do you want coffee? Ask yourself before going here.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 5, 2017~Slow and sloppy. My Double Chocolate Chip Frappe was actually a Java Chip Frappe. The difference is the caffeine content. I can't drink anything with caffeine in it so I basically wasted 20 minutes and $5. When I got the frappe, the cover wasn't on properly and the chocolate was running down the side of the cup. What a mess. Not worth your time.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 14, 2017~The worst Starbucks I have ever visited.  The lady two customers in front of me had a birthday reward on her phone that took 4 employees to figure out. The young lady at the cash register was actually very nice and articulate. She was obviously new so no judgement towards her. I asked for my beverage to have EXTRA almond milk and even went so far to say that I would like  it to be light in color.  When I got my coffee I tried to verify that there was extra almond milk. The girl serving the drinks said yes almond milk, to which is said EXTRA almond milk.  Again she said yes almond milk. I informed her that I had asked for EXTRA almond milk to which she said yea just come back and ask for more if it's not enough. The coffee was almost black. I went back and asked for EXTRA almond milk. She poured me the equivalent of a shot of almond milk in a paper cup. So glad o don't live in this part of town.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 11, 2017~How can they have five people working and take 10 minutes to prepare a coffee. Worst aStarbucks ever!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 29, 2014~This is the slowest Starbucks they don't seem to have a priority to get things going in the morning I used to think it was when it was new but by far the slowest I go to. If there was another one closer I would not come here!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 5, 2014~This starbucks is one of the worst I have used.  It's disappointing since it is so close to my house.  I will drive out of my way to go to a different location.  The customer service is non-existent.  When I go through the drive thru, my order is typically wrong and this has happened multiple times.  When I go inside,  I typically need to wait 15 minutes or longer for my drink due to a poor process for managing the work flow.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3.9~(478 reviews)~Yes - 4 stars! Coffee and food were excellent!  Bacon Gouda breakfast sandwiches and pumpkin bread. Both YUMMY! Patronize this location - got it right and staff were very pleasant. Will go back when in that area. Skip the McDonald's and get your breakfast here. Well worth it!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4.2~(162 reviews)~Makes sense why this location specifically has 2 stars. I went this morning at 5 am for an egg white spinach wrap. After receiving my wrap which was dry and over heated , I asked for a sriracha packet to help with the flavor. The woman Jen, had an attitude and proceeded to tell me that I needed to ask for the siracha packet prior to receiving my food for inventory reasons next time. I feel that is the most ridiculous rule and how would anyone know that. Also at 5 am being reprimanded for not asking for the sauce packet at the right time is not anything anyone should deal with. Starbucks do better at training your employees on customer service skills. Jen should probably be demoted.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 14, 2024~I was going to give this SB 4 stars for the nice location, seating area and hardworking staff. Unfortunately, the Managers, Ben, unprofessional behavior toward me knocked them down to 2 stars. I've been going to Starbucks since 1994 and this guy made the worst move I've seen.While I walked out of the store, this toolbag Ben tried to block my way(bordering on committing a serious crime)then followed me out demanding I clean the one paper starbucks cup I drank from off the table I sat at! I was shocked and rather bemused that someone(who apparently is the store manager)would have the audacity to order me to clean one cup off a table for him. I told him no and his behavior is totally unprofessional.FYI: I've sometimes cleaned trash off the floor and other people's tables when in SBs when they're really busy to help them out. So the issue is his improper behavior. Customers are never obliged to clean their tables unless in rare cases when they make big messes that are not accidental. I've had years of customer service and sales experience and there was no excuse for his behavior and tone was way over the line.Not recommended SB.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 5, 2024~Terrible customer service!! Don't come here to this location. I asked the lady at the drive thru if it was possible to add more water and ice to my drink and she said she needed to charge me simply because she had to go to the bar to get the extra water and ice. She was very condescending and snobbish she told me I was holding up the line!!! Unbelievable!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jan 13, 2022~I asked for a pour over black coffee and was told multiple times it would take too long and to just have the drip coffee in the pot. Every other coffee is specially made: mocha, macchiato, Frappuccino, espresso, americano, etc.. I'm paying money and I don't want burnt drip coffee (I can taste it every time because I drink black). It was literally like pulling teeth for her to do it. All you guys do is make coffee and it literally takes the same amount of time as any other drink. Really disappointing and only went because I had a gift card.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 10, 2023~Want the WORST customer service at Starbucks? Come to this location, they will screw up your order then make you feel bad for it. They will give you weird looks if you ask for things and tell you to come inside to get your drink because they are too overwhelmed to get it right and give it to you through the window. Jack is the only nice person there - everyone else I've encountered has been incredibly rude.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jan 12, 2023~I can't tell you how many times I've received my drink improperly made by this location. I stopped going here but do so as a last resort- even though it's the closest location to where I live. I've asked for my drink to be remade in the past and the store manager is far from apologetic, yet seems to only come up with excuses as to why I should have expected something else. I highly suggest avoiding this Starbucks location unless absolutely necessary. For example, your other `"go-to`" locations being out of cold brew or temporary closed due to a pandemic.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 1, 2021~I have been here 2 times. Each time it took 15 minutes to make the drinks. The drinks we ordered where very basic. Also, stated `"Merry Christmas`" as my name and they did not put it on the cup, wtf?Not coming back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 24, 2020~I give this Starbucks 5 stars because:- They get my order right (Venti iced green tea with half the sweetener) every time!- They remember to ask me my name for my orders. - The food is great there as well!!! The only thing I do not like is that my Starbucks app will not get stars for a reason I do not know.Keep up the amazing work, Starbucks!!! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Nov 21, 2015~This is the worst Starbucks location by far. The drive through is terribly slow.I had ordered an americano with 2 pumps of flavor and at first she said $5.25. And I said, for an americano?? And then she proceeded to tell me I didn't order my drink right. Which I've worked for Starbucks so I know how to order... so she re rang it at $4.75. Nearly $5 for a freaking americano when normally they charge $3.50. I wish Starbucks was more consistent on how they charge individuals.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4.1~(92 reviews)~Probably not returning to this location anymore.I usually only stop at Starbucks if I also need breakfast, as I think their coffee is just okay, but I do enjoy their breakfast foods. Anyways, I've been here a handful of times, and while they seem to get the my food ready quickly, they fail at every other aspect.No one is particularly friendly. I've only had friendly service one visit, and I've never seen that barista again.The lines are generally very long in the drive thru. It seemed to be quicker to go inside, but recently, thats been really slow too....even though there's generally just a few people in line inside the store.Last straw was last week. I got an iced coffee for myself and a flat white for a co-worker. When I got to work, my co-worker said there was no espresso in his drink. I waited 15 minutes and paid $4 for steamed milk. How do you forget the espresso?! You had one job Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4.2~(162 reviews)~Came here cuz I have a gift card. And to remind myself why I wouldn't otherwise.  Way over priced and way sub standard quality!  Here is what a $5 breakfast sandwich looks like at Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Aug 18, 2016~Just tried to buy two drinks &amp; a cake pop totaling less than $14 and they had to turn us away because they couldn't make change for a $50 bill!!!!  Are you kidding me?  Who runs this place?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 6, 2016~Always fast and apologize if at times it is slow. Since they are only human and not robots, one can not get mad at them during those rush times. Within those times you NEVER see anyone standing around they are all trying to do their jobs and or ask if others need help. Seeing this makes the wait worth it as thats how a team should be and again they aren't robots and sometimes will have to remake drinks and when there is 10+ cars in the drive thru 10+ people inside and mobile orders, it is perfectly reasonable to have patience and wait for my perfectly good cup of coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 30, 2014~This is the worst ordering experience I have ever  had anywhere. Multiple times the girl just gave up while taking my order. Like didn't respond. It took so long while the two just laughed and did nothing while I waited. Do not go to this location. Tried three times. Disaster. Wrong order then argued with me that the didn't hear me say that. Ugh seriously wonder how this location is still here.I accidentally went to this location today 08/07/2016 and realized it too late. This time I actually was yelled at and told I didn't order sf and next time if I want it I need to ask for it, I said I did and the lady snapped at me that I did not! And wouldn't give me my coffee. I drove off with her yelling in the back ground. Wowwww
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 13, 2019~This is the worst ordering experience I have ever  had anywhere. Multiple times the girl just gave up while taking my order. Like didn't respond. It took so long while the two just laughed and did nothing while I waited. Do not go to this location. Tried three times. Disaster.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 6, 2016~Let me start off with I've worked at Starbucks before. No it's not the most enjoyable place but these people are extremely rude and have no personality at all. This is the second visit and I just got a stare and they just handed me my stuff with out saying anything not even a have a good day or sorry we messed up your order. This location has always sucked and I should know better than to go but I do anyways in hopes it would be different.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 31, 2016~This one is clearly improved, sat for twenty minutes and didn't order anything and nobody called police, but I'm white so could be that and they were pretty busy at the time, napkins and half and half ran out they didn't get refilled.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 27, 2017~This is a new store.  HUGE, clean, SHINY new, and love the comfortable feel to the place!  Tons of tables, chairs, desk, couch, comfy chairs, etc.  The employees are friendly!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~May 13, 2018~I am a fair regular here since it's right across the street from work. As Starbucks stores go it's pretty average. Nothing stands out but the service is usually friendly and on point. I did prefer the older location and layout before they built the specific site for this one. The seating here is somewhat cramped and boringly laid out. There is a decent patio area to use when the weather is milder, so that mitigates the interior situation somewhat. There is a drive-thru if you need to grab your concoction on the run. Overall a good store.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 15, 2013~First nice place and clean as well the service was good today the young man was very good if those I have a special needs but he repeated my order must sure he got the order right
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Oct 4, 2017~I just moved to the area a few months ago and have been going to this Starbucks to work 2-3 days a week and I have been impressed. I love the large, comfortable outdoor patio with shaded and sunny seats. They also have a few couches inside and well as bench seating which is nice to work at. It is always relatively busy, but not too busy to not get a spot to work. The staff is very friendly and fast. The restrooms are always tidy. All-in-all, they deserve a big red 5 stars from me for offering up such a nice work environment for me each week. Thank you Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4.1~(92 reviews)~I love starbucks. And this place is within my walking distance so I came here.one thing I noticed before also that the attendants are too busy always. I don't understand why. Coz there are always few customer whenever I go.last time I came here there were 2 boys and 1 boys attending everyone.the boy who took my order was pretty friendly and good attendant.but other two attendants were so busy talking with each other that I had to wait more than 10 mnts (though there were no other customer) and as after she gave me my coffee she had no time to say anything or to give a single reply of thanks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4.2~(162 reviews)~I love this location because there is plenty of seating both indoors and outside.  No worry about snagging a seat!  Love their lunch sammies- tasty for something that is so convenient.  Consistent employees.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jan 6, 2015~Customer service is amazing.. they always get my drink right amber is awesome with how friendly she is.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Apr 26, 2017~Worst service through the drive-through today. The gal didn't even acknowledge me when I drove up. She looked and got my drink, then just handed it to me and told me how much it was. Didn't tell me what my drink was or ask if it  was correct.  Took my debit card swiped it and then just handed it to me and didn't even look at me. She was way too busy having a conversation with him ever was there with her working. This is one reason why I don't like going to Starbucks the customer service pretty much sucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 10, 2017~It's Starbucks, you know what you're going to get: good coffee, and friendly service.As a side note, I happened to walk into this location right when they were cleaning the coffee machine they needed for my drink.  Even though I had to wait an extra 4 - 5 minutes for my coffee, the barista was very apologetic and kind, so I hardly minded the wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jul 25, 2016~I love Starbucks. For real. But when I have a dance competition and y'all wanna be hella slow in your drive thru it's ridiculous. I've been sitting here for ten min and there was only four cars in front of me. Do you guys not know how to be fast and efficient? Honest question. I love this place and the workers but i DREAD having to come thru the drive thru bc it takes way longer than should. Thank you for ur time
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Apr 26, 2011~Terribly disappointed.  Ordered a marbled mocha macchiato but they messed it up.  There was caramel all over the cup and the Starbucks employee saw it and before I could ask for napkins slammed the door.  I will not be a patron of this Starbucks ever again.  Also, I'd like the tip I gave them back.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Feb 17, 2019~slowest drive through ever! I'm 12 minutes into this and still 2 cars back. you MUST specify `" no whip`" or you end up with a half full coffee. Very disappointing.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 17, 2015~I sat at this Starbucks for 3 hours cause my car broke down. Super nice staff and a nice atmosphere.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Oct 7, 2016~WARNING!! WARNING!!  ALL PARENTS BEWARE!!  I should have know it was going to be BAD with the vacant look in Jasmines eyes.  I guess asking for honey with my oatmeal was more than she could handle.  Our 7 year old (yes seven year old boy) ordered a hot chocolate and she verified to temp it for a child.   After receiving our order he complained it didn't taste like hot chocolate.  We both tasted the said hot chocolate and found it to be coffee with mocha added.  WHAT ADULT give coffee to a 7 year old that ordered hot chocolate!!  It took it up to the barista and was told yes it was coffee with mocha as ordered?!?  I informed her that we had in fact ordered hot chocolate!  She was the only one working there that seemed to care about this mistake.   Then Alissa comes into the picture and offered to remake the drink as she rolled her eyes at me.  I explained we were leaving and to just refund our money.   She didn't seem to be happy with this option.   So rather than refund our money promptly she made two more drinks.  I asked for a number and contact person for this Starbucks location and she explained she was busy and it was going to take her a while.   I explained that the longer it took her to get me the information, the more I would complain.  Well here I am starting my complaining!!!  And this is just the start Alissa!   I am not sorry to interrupt your busy morning with my complaints!  And at no time did she apologize for such an error!  Seriously!! Who thinks it's ok to give coffee to a child!! FAIL!!!!  I wish Yelp would allow negative stars for rating!  And when I asked for a corporate number for Starbucks she took over 5 minutes.  At this point I just left and decided to do it my way.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4.1~(92 reviews)~This place needs to get organized. The time i wasted here waiting was crazy. 15 minutes. Also they all talk to much.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4.2~(162 reviews)~Worst wifi ever. On its best day it barely works. 3 months of weekly wifi complaints an Google wifi provider can't get it functional
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Feb 29, 2016~This was not a good experience. My drink tasted too sugary! And the customer service was horrible, I can't believe this was a Starbucks since all the other ones have much better service.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 9, 2013~I'm a Starbucks junkie and I wasn't really feeling this place.  It took forever to order and I was actually pretty cool with that.  But they never asked for my name or anyone's name so getting the drinks was a little confusing.  If you ordered the same thing as someone else, everyone was standing around trying to make sure they weren't taking each other's drinks.  To make matters worse they were making the drinks out of order.  So two people behind me that ordered the same thing as me, received their drinks first.  The only reason I knew they were my order was I added extra sweetness to mine and they ordered theirs regular.  It just seemed like a lot of chaos without any real system. It appeared to be two people were focused on the drive thru window and occasionally they would make a drink for the walk in customers but like I said it was completely out of order and without names on 3/4ths of them to tell them apart.  Thankfully I was only there because my tire was getting changed.  I would avoid going here if I ever needed a fix again.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Aug 20, 2014~Great location with a drive-thru window.  Plenty of seating and parking with well lit lights in the parking lot so you feel safe walking to your car at night.  I never buy their food items as everything were made in a warehouse and shipped it to the store.  My Starbucks app worked every time, easy!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jun 26, 2016~Bathrooms were dirty with no toilet paper. Staff fought about who was to take care of the customers so I waited 5 mins for someone to come to the register to greet me. Egg sandwiches come frozen and are nuked. Staff is not educated about the food or the coffee. Very sad this a new place but service is horrible. Don't ever get food at any Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~May 23, 2017~Update: went back today for my beloved Passion Tea Lemonade... it took 17 minutes from stepping in line until I finally got my drink. And to make it worse, my tea was luke warm at the bottom if the cup and only cold at top where the ice is.. how did they manage to pull that one off? Not shaking it properly? Who knows..
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 15, 2014~Not sure how the levels of service vary so drastically between Starbucks, but this location is literally the worst one I've ever been to. And, it is unfortunately the closest one to my house. The service is always extremely slow, so decent personalities behind the register and no noticed care for their customers. I've been at this location several times hoping it wasn't just one bad day, but it's been every time. Why does it take over 10 minutes to make a passion tea? And no `"sorry for the wait`"? This location really needs to get completely restaffed.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Oct 9, 2014~They take care of their customers here.  Drive-through took a little longer than I would've wanted but was pleasantly surprised to receive my order for free when I got to the window, thanks for the great customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Sep 26, 2014~Terrible service. The lobby is always full of people waiting for orders that the staff has forgotten, the drive through is always backed up into the parking lot.I've waited as long as 20 minutes for an order (combined time between ordering, learning they forgot my order, and having to wait for it to be made), and there's no sense of urgency or customer service.The staff is terribly disorganized and out of their depth.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 24, 2017~This store has come a very long way in the last six months. It's extremely busy in the drive-thru lane and in store as well. I've been here almost every day for the past few years and they've gone thru several managers and tons of staff! The service has been spotty because of all the changes. I think they've got it together now! Kimber and Amy are rock stars here. Give them a chance.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4.1~(110 reviews)~A typical Starbucks layout but the baristas are very quick here and it is one Starbucks that has never disapointed for a good pull. The place is always clean and the employees can been found with a smile on their faces.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4.1~(92 reviews)~What can you say. It's Starbucks. I like the way it's set up. Nice location. I think the A/C could stand to be turned down a couple of degrees.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Dec 28, 2014~5 star moment when I called out hot and got to the window and you remake my drink anyway. Thanks for that.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jul 6, 2013~One of the most careless Starbucks staff over here. They don't care for your time.. And they don't show any sign of regret for screwing up.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 28, 2014~Worst manager with customer service I've ever had at a Starbucks. Just got a venti iced caramel macchiato and she told me I could only get a certain way and now I waited in line to have it taste horrible. And she proceeded to tell me how they could not do it the way I had requested when I get it the same way for the past year at a different Starbucks locations anywhere else I go. And she has to answer with annoying welcome about coming to Starbucks through the microphone and show her face. Just awful I will never return to this location! She has a ponytail with a nose ring in her nose...in case u get her. Is much money and I spend on a freaking coffee here I should be able to get it how I like it! Because of her I am officially not going to do Starbucks any longer which I have been meaning to do for a while. support your local coffee places.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 24, 2016~The baristas at this Starbucks are the BEST! They are very friendly and make my drink perfectly every time. This location is always clean and organized. This is my favorite Starbucks location in the valley!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 16, 2015~It's Starbuck's right?  It's a Friday, it's hot outside.  Green Tea-Lemonade would hit the spot.  Sorry we cannot make it, we ran out of lemonade.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 8, 2013~Overall, not too bad.  Fair amount of seating when you include outside, but I like to plug in.  Luckily they have a long table with some outlets.  Service is hit or miss, mostly good but sometimes less-than-pleasant.   Wifi is hit or miss, better than stores with att; but not as fast as I've had at other google wifi locations.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Aug 28, 2015~Other then the potato for a worker, Carson Panipinto, this Starbucks is amazing. I am one of his best friends, and he disrespects me! A customer! How dare he! XD
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~May 13, 2015~Quick service, friendly personable staff.  Always helpful and much more room than the last facility that was not a stand alone in this same area.  I love the drive-thru as there aren't many drive-thru Starbucks options in this area.  Definitely going back and enjoyed my coffee just  the way I ordered it!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Oct 3, 2024~Good morning breakfast sandwich eggs cheese sausages and drink Frappuccino whip cream with caramels
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Sep 3, 2024~Im eating for breakfast eggs cheese sausage sandwich and drink lemonade and strawberry
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Sep 1, 2024~It's drink coffee iced latte and some Frappuccino whip cream caramel drink and strawberry leomade drink coffee latte
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 26, 2024~Frappuccino whip cream caramel drink and sausages eggs breakfast and lemonade drink and coffee drink
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jun 3, 2024~Good morning breakfast sausages cheese eggs and Frappuccino and some coffee some food
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~May 7, 2024~Frappuccino whip cream with caramel drink and lemonade cake about this morning  with Starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Dec 31, 2020~A special kudos to the wonderful ladies making the drinks at this Starbucks. Not so much as a grimace as they wade their way through the fits and starts of people ordering an array of dessert drinks (its a coffee shop people! Try it, you might like it, and these barristas are splendid!) But seriously, considering the heavy foot traffic at this location, they deal with it admirably, and with smiles and laughter - and those ingredients always make the BEST coffee. A massive thank you from your favorite Brit customer.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Dec 21, 2020~The ladies at this location are amazing! Super friendly, cheerful and they even sang happy birthday when making my peppermint mocha.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Oct 13, 2021~This Starbucks Never has cold brew. Either they are not stocked very well or they forget to make it at night. I highly doubt that they are not stocked well as it is a daily occurrence for me. It has become an extreme waste of time. Extremely disappointed
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Aug 7, 2016~Service is great but I really don't understand why there's only one person working... Taking orders and making drinks? What is this a sweat shop?A few people in front of me got outta line cause the wait was too long smh this isn't the first time I've seen this happen
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Nov 7, 2020~Big fan of Starbucks coffee and rewards! Never had bad customer service by any employee till coming to this location. The girl Taylor working was very unfriendly and short with the customers. Coffees came out watery and not the usual.. definitely won't be going back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~May 13, 2018~On Mother's Day, there was only one girl working. She was making drinks and taking orders alone! I ordered a Starbucks double shot and it tasted like there was no espresso shots at all. I was in a hurry so I couldn't taste my coffee til I was out and the line was way too long for me to come back in. I'm done with these Starbucks inside grocery stores they never get it right
Phoenix, AZ 85021~4~Jun 30, 2015~Starbucks is pretty much the McDonald's of coffee.  Not cheap but you know you will get the same thing the same way at every single location.  The coffee is good, I like the dessert element they make coffee into.  The food is ok and you can usually count on it being consistent and fresh.  The writing of your name on the cup in TOTALLY obtuse and weird phonetic fashion has got to be something they either train them for or look for that quality when they are hiring.  The staff is not ignorant and they are always pleasant and courteous.  I love the new Cool Refreshers to take to yoga!  Yum.  I also like the new app they have which makes the whole ordering, paying and tipping process cashless.  That makes it convenient and make a me more likely to search out a Starbucks.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jan 24, 2019~Thursday 1/24/2019 at 9 a.m. English is my second language I'll try my best to tell you what happened to me at this Starbucks store. I was awaiting for my iced tea and a coffee an young employee gave an iced tea first while I was waiting for the coffee accidentally I dropped the iced tea all over floor the employees right away came and cleaned up the mess for me and I was planning to buy another Iced Tea but the the same employee gave me another tea right away without charge. .After I got my iced tea and coffee I opened the doors to get out somehow I accidentally I dropped Iced tea and coffee all over the floor again I was so embarrassed to picked up the cups, said sorry to everyone but everyone was just smile and gave me the looks that they understood the situation and forgave me my mistakes. Again Starbucks employees helped me out and offer me another iced tea and coffee with all the beautiful smiles.I did trying to pay for the iced tea and coffee again but she said she loves to give them to me again without charges.It was a bad morning at first but I saw Starbucks employees and customers at this store were so nice to me. I'll never forget yours kindness. You guys are awesome. Goddess you and peace to be with you always I'm an American now and I'm very proud to be part of your community.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Nov 21, 2022~I love this statbucks! it's not to far away from my house and the employees are so nice! the drinks are always delicious and filled to the brim. definitely recommend!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 22, 2021~Fantastic Service on a Friday morning this location is packed!!!!! They got everyone their orders in a timely manner, were very nice. Love the staff. Definitely coming back
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Mar 4, 2019~Always go into this Safeway Starbucks because the folks are friendly, suggest new things to try, and care about customer satisfaction. There's a free standing Starbucks in the same strip mall but I prefer the Safeway Starbucks because it's quicker service and you can pick up any grocery items at the same time!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Mar 22, 2020~terrible !!! went in before work, there was no line, and i ordered my drink, which he repeated back to me, and it came out wrong. the man nicely remade it for me, and as i was driving away, i realized they forgot the lemon loaf that i originally ordered. very disappointed to start my day off like this. especially with how expensive starbucks food can be. with all the options of starbucks locations, definitely will not be returning to this one.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 22, 2022~If you like this place you are a very good person cause there drinks are amazing in many different ways so this is why I think you should by there amazinggg drinks and food we all love food so muchLove you guys
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Feb 16, 2024~Despite years of being an avid Starbucks fan, I have to say that this location (as well as another one on 27th Ave) are the two worst locations ever. When we entered the person who was taking the order didn't even let us hit the counter before he robotically stated, `"what is your order`" and `"is there anything else`"?  He said this around 10 times as there were three people in our group. What was worse was no eye contact when I asked him a question and he continued to touch an earphone despite this location not having a drive through.  Things got a bit tense when I told him it was my birthday for my free drink and he told me that I `"should`" have told him this at the beginning.  Despite this location having a great patio area, I probably won't go back.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Apr 4, 2024~I haven't been to this location in months and I wish I didn't go there today. When I ordered the women at the register was a real biatch. It was obvious that she hates her job. I felt like how dare you come in and bother me to place an order. When I asked for a receipt she glared at me like WTF. She tore it off and I never got as much as a hello or goodbye. The bathroom door doesn't lock the knob will not stay pressed in. So after using the restroom and was walked in on twice I returned  to the pickup counter to receive my coffee a food order. And to my surprise I had to deal with another rude employee. The young man not pleasant and didn't call my name out for the order because the rude cashier didn't ask for one. So I waited and waited and after a number of people picked up I asked if the drink on counter is mine. He replied yes by not making eye contact. I will not be returning to this store after another terrible experience.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Mar 12, 2024~Love Starbs and always enjoy their drinks. I've already had the lavender oat milk latte a handful of times and LOVED it. I ordered from this location and was given my drink with the powder just sitting at the bottom of the cup. I asked what it was and was told it was the powder and that's how it comes. Not only is that not how it's advertised but not how I've received it the handful of times before. I was told to just stir it in. I asked if it could be remade the right way and the barista looked at me and snatched the drink while rolling her eyes. I got a new drink... with no lavender at all. Very disappointed in this location and service. I understand mistakes happen however the customer service was not good. If a drink is made incorrectly you should be able to get it remade with no attitude and get the correct drink you paid for.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~May 23, 2020~Update:I've been back a number of times and the recent and current staff are pretty amazing. I am always warmly greeted and feel like they truly appreciate my business. I'm grateful to have this location nearby, they're doing a great job!!!First review:Always takes awhile to be acknowledged (they don't tend to keep someone consistently manning the register) and orders always take longer than other locations. Tends to be hot inside. I definitely only come bc of the loc
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Oct 19, 2019~Always takes awhile to be acknowledged (they don't tend to keep someone consistently manning the register) and orders always take longer than other locations. Tends to be hot inside. I definitely only come bc of the location.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Mar 17, 2019~This stop has a terrific artist that draws fun ads on their boards and great service.  I like stopping by on my way to my in-laws house.  We can get coffee and then go hang out. They have tons of shaded outdoor seating and plugs for indoor seating.  There is a long community table and little two seaters. I like the *bar* seating myself.  This is a great stop.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 25, 2021~GREAT SERVICE!!! Happy welcomes when anyone walks in!!! My Starbucks is on 59th Ave. and Union Hills Road. That has been my Starbucks for 17 years I want to say or even longer since they opened. I have seen many many gifted and talented barista's behind the counter go on to extraordinary careers in various professions. Fav drink is ICED GREEN TEA...NO SUGARTRY THIS LOCATION!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jan 1, 2019~Love love love this Starbucks. Let's just start with hello my 2019 review is going to be about my fav Starbucks. Everyone who lives in the area should just come to this one. They listen you guys. You tell them the order like mine (venti iced coffee with classic, vanilla and cream) and guess what it's perfect every time! That's crazy bc a lot of other location will say this `"you sure u want that?`" Why why question it. And I always get a cute little note on my cup. The lovely ladies and gentlemen that work here totally always go above and beyond for me my husband my kids. Even the people are are there working at a table or enjoying the huge patio are so friendly.I'm here every morning and there is never a line BUT if there is you are guaranteed it's going to be quick.It's a great location tons of parking and it's a rare one bc it's not a drive thru. My fan Starbucks in Glendale.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Dec 3, 2018~Nice and big Starbucks. They also have a patio! Even though it's cold outside I still like my caramel frappacino. Great place for studying.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Dec 22, 2016~This is by far one of my favorite Starbucks locations.It is near my dad's house so we stop here whenever we are going to see him.I love the layout, especially the outdoor patio area.  Plenty of shade and seating.Been here several times and they have always gotten my drink and my name right.Every employee I have interacted with here has been friendly and nice.  Very sociable.Would highly recommend this location.  You won't be disappointed.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 23, 2022~Quick service. Spacious, beautiful outdoor seating. Tables need to be cleaned sooner, though.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Apr 23, 2019~What a disappointment. I visit the establishment weekly with friends. We are very disappointed with the cleanliness of the patio. The patio was built for the customers who pay $5 per cup of coffee to enjoy it outdoors. Today was not unlike any other day bird poop is everywhere. The tables, chairs and the concrete is coated with bird crap. The manager of the establishment should have the patio washed off with a hose daily knowing that the birds poop daily. We also wonder how bad the back of the house is considering no attention is taken in the front of the house.Very, sad such a nice establishment in a nice area.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Aug 31, 2022~Well that was horrible. Waited over 12 mins for my drinks (they were sitting there) I had told her my name (she looked upset) a while later I noticed her putting some drinks on a carrier but couldn't see them from where I was and she still left them on the side until I asked again and she says okay just wait a second like wth not happy with waiting so long specially when someone has an attitude, just her facial expression was so uninviting...  I know ppl might have bad days but it can make a difference in us as a customer.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 17, 2021~Fireball Alina and Mang Tory have Hearts as Warm as my Vanilla Latte. Open Super early and make your Coffee experience feel like you're Family.   Will become a Frequent Customer as  they take the Time to make Customer a Priority. Five Stars isn't enough.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 13, 2019~Since I moved across the street I have been visiting this Starbucks daily. They truly  have the most courteous staff reminiscent of the good old days of the non hurried baristas. Inviting,  clean, orderly store. The pastries and food items are always fresh, outdoor seating is nice also. The staff really make the whole experience exceptional. If I am a little ways aways and craving a cold brew I will wait until I get close to home to pop into my favorite Starbucks ever!This store is a top model for the other stores in the district by far :)
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jan 27, 2016~A nice start to the day This Starbucks is not my usual stop however, it just might be my favorite. I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks iced white chocolate mocha, I can't think of anything and vanilla scone.The service at this Starbucks is phenomenal and the staff are always very friendly. This location is clean, inviting, and feels comfortable and they have seating outside at the patio, and wuth this cooler weather what a perfect option.My coffee was made exactly the way I order and tasted great. In addition, to the great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack. I really enjoy grabbing a cake pop or two to go.Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jun 3, 2016~The service is terrible here! I come because it's so close and I need a coffee fast but don't expect customer service to be a priority! It's also always messy and dirty, out of napkins and straws. $5 for a cup of coffee, it should be made that way I like it and a smile?! Not everyone is rude here but majority rules. They also have a whole wall of holiday sale items with no sign of how much they are or even a percentage for customers to figure it out.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Dec 28, 2015~The service is terrible here! I come because it's so close and I need a coffee fast but don't expect customer service to be a priority! It's also always messy and dirty, out of napkins and straws. $5 for a cup of coffee, it should be made that way I like it and a smile?! Not everyone is rude here but majority rules. They also have a whole wall of holiday sale items with no sign of how much they are or even a percentage for customers to figure it out.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 1, 2021~I seriously hate going to this location. They never get anything right and are very rude
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Nov 22, 2017~I don't recommend this location. Last time I was here was about 6 months or so. The lady playing manager acts like she's on a doctor Phil show and customers are at fault for things they obviously are not responsible for!There are plenty of great Starbucks around! Just not this one!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 24, 2020~This has to be the SLOWEST Starbucks I have ever been to. This is not my first interaction with this store. This store has let me down more than once. I placed an online order 15 minutes prior to arriving and order was still incomplete. Order should have taken 7-8. After going inside still waited over 5 additional minutes. They seem to work with no  purpose. Half made drinks sitting on counter. Yes mine was one of them. Oh boy was it a difficult one. Iced green tea with a splash of apple juice. I would go out of my way to avoid this location.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~May 20, 2021~This is the best location within a fifteen-mile radius. Everyone greets me with a smile every day, and I love stopping here on my way to work. I am writing this review after experiencing another location; I just like going here because they are polite and helpful, and the coffee is always good anyways.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 19, 2019~So I almost didn't stop because it didn't have a drive thru but I'm glad I did. Jordyn who took my order was so nice not only did I give her a tip, but I'm writing a review because she was so sweet wishing me good luck on my state board! I hope she gets major credit because she's awesome.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jun 5, 2017~This is a good Starbucks a lot of room inside and misters outside on patio. They also have the reserve coffees.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jun 20, 2014~They stop making decaf at 12. So I was told, that's odd since you would figure a lot of people don't want caffeine later in the day. Oh well. It is what it is.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jan 28, 2017~I usually go here for an after dinner cappuccino or when my mom is visiting since she loves her Starbucks! Everytime we've been here it has been not busy at all and the staff was always in the front cleaning or waiting to take orders. One day I was feeling extraordinarily brazen and had my boyfriend grab me a breakfast sandwich. It was delicious! I'm not usually a morning person so I'm not too sure what it's like at peak breakfast rush but after dinner it's always a very chill atmosphere.The outside area is pretty nice, I always see people sitting there talking and relaxing. The straw/napkin area is always pretty nicely stocked and every time I go in there's always an employee sweeping! Some of the workers there have gotten my boyfriend's name wrong a couple times but it's pretty funny seeing what they write and since the establishment is always empty when we go it's not an issue! I will continue to go back here!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Feb 27, 2020~The service is great there!  Super fast orders too!  Love it!I usually visit 2-3 time per week!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Apr 11, 2014~This place is literally in walking distance from me making it unfathomably irresistible to try, so I did. The million dollar question is, how does this Starbucks differ from the rest? It is a chain after all. Well I'll tell you. After its recent remodel it's one of the nicest in the valley, as well as one of the cleanest, with one of the nicest staff. Whether you're sitting inside or out, it's enjoyable. It seems the main complaint here on Yelp from others is the `"smokers.`" Well I personally don't think the staff has the time and energy to constantly check on this issue as they make coffee. The best thing they can do is put up signs. Maybe you, the patron should suggest something to the smokers you are vehemently eyeing. :P
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Feb 3, 2019~Randy saw me trying to figure out the hours on the door. He came and unlocked the door and said we're closing up, but you can be our last customer. Unfortunately they had just poured out the tea for the night. They kindly offered to get me something else or at least a water. I thought they were kind and I appreciated them both. What great workers!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 4, 2018~Favorite Starbucks in the area. I love sitting on their outdoor patio. It's shaded by a few trees and they have water misters as well!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 1, 2018~Drink is ALWAYS right! Staff are so amazingly nice. You can tell the manager truly fosters a positive atmosphere because every single employee I have ever come into contact with has been so nice. Gorgeous patio to boot. Love this location!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jan 9, 2016~Go there if you have time to wait for your coffee. Saturday morning they only had one cashier and two other workers. It is nice and clean. I wish they had more seating. This is one of the busiest Starbucks I have been to. Disappointed by the shortness of staff!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~May 1, 2018~Hit or miss. Sometimes I get friendly service, and other times, I get ignored while the barista carries on a full blown conversation with someone else like I'm not even there. I will not be ignored, Dan! Drinks have at least been consistent in my experience. Nice patio as well.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~May 23, 2017~First time I went in was today. My drink was fine; it's the baristas that I had an issue with. For one, no eye contact from anyone. Then someone in the back room (Ryder? Spider? Who knows...) had a visitor so this involved a lot of screaming towards that person in the back room to come out and say hi. Apparently this was more important than making the drinks in a timely manner and saying thank you when said drinks are picked up. Y'know, how other baristas in other Starbucks do.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 29, 2017~I've been here many times over the last several years and I have to say this place always has a great vibe to it. The staff are friendly and the drinks are always perfect. I highly recommend it.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~May 26, 2009~Okay if you are a smoker, prepare to be offended. I drive by this Starbucks Coffee often and it looks perfect from a distance. The misters are going full force putting out billows of mist. The grass is a lush green and the plants around it give it a tropical feel. The deck is amazing with about 20 tables that seat 2-5 people each. The tables have umbrellas and shade trees above them and the place is ducked back out of the way of the general public - away from the hustle and bustle - in its own little private oasis.But upon closer approach, it begins to loose its charming appeal. As I got closer, I noticed that the billows of mist were not solely mist but more like billows of cigarette smoke, and the odor confirmed it. As I was walking from my car and even before I got to the pavement, I began to smell the scent of tobacco and addiction. I gave it a shot though. I coughed my way across the deck looking for a seat that was not located next to the smokers, but there were none. Oh, there were seats available, but the deck was filled with addicts sucking away at their poison and ignorantly blowing it into my air. No, no place for a non-smoker or anyone who is semi-health conscious. But this is a place of vices - after all, it is coffee - caffeine and another form of addiction so - really - what else should I have expected? The deck and all of the beauty outside literally disappeared behind a giant wall of smoke, and the smell was horrible.I quickly walked inside where I could breathe without taking years off of my life, and it was okay inside. There were a few comfy looking couches, a few wooden tables with wooden seats and one long bench area with tables. It worked. I was comfortable. The coffee bar was small. They did not have Stevia, but they did have chocolate and cinnamon and Splenda. I did not see computers so idk if they had wifi. The inside was not very peaceful and I found myself wishing I could sit outside. It looks like the smokers dominate this place. I will not go back. I would love to be able to sit outside and feel that I should be able to without breathing in all the poison and stink - but like I said, it is a place of vices.If you smoke, you should really like it. They even have live music outside sometimes. I was disappointed and did not stay. I left to go get a movie and went home smelling like an ash tray - not very attractive at all - which was especially bad considering this was a date night.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Mar 7, 2018~This is my favorite Starbucks in the area. Nothing special about the drinks, they are consistent with other Starbucks locations I've visited. However, what sets them apart is the friendliness of the staff. When I walk in I'm usually greeted by name and I have my coffee in hand within seconds of walking in (since I always use the app, but at other locations I normally have to get someone's attention to get my drink).
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~May 15, 2016~My family and I popped in to this Starbucks tonight for a late night caffeine fix. The barista, Riley, was very patient with my younger daughter and we appreciated her suggestions for new drinks--vanilla bean frap with peppermint flavor and chocolate chips.  Yum!!  We will absolutely come back here.  Thank you and I feel tonight's trip to Starbucks was worth both our time and money.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Mar 18, 2017~I generally have had great experiences with Starbucks, but this location is miserable. The service is extremely slow. It took me almost 30 minutes to get my drink. It seemed that the staff was more interested in helping their friends than the paying customers.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Apr 8, 2009~Bad location for many reasons.  Parking is inadequate.  There's nowhere near enough seating for the volume that this place has.  There's not enough room to accommodate the morning line to order.Consistent like most Starbucks locations are, however not as appealing to those of us who prefer black coffee because they no longer rotate the coffee varietal in the drip.  Everyday it's the same now, over and over and over and over.  Great decision, Starbucks.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Apr 10, 2015~Normally when I come to Starbucks I order a caramel Macchiato  a.k.a. latte lol. I like it a lot but if I order a large they over milk it and that's why I'm giving them a three star. I don't like companies out water down my coffee with milk. All other legit copy shops that I go to don't do this except for Starbucks.  I'm not saying they're bad I just get annoyed when they do that and I have to ask for extra shots. Also do not really consistent how they make their drinks. Are they good? Are they bad? Well there you go guys three stars it is we don't know. Well I hope the review helped and I'm sure everyone knows were Starbucks is on this is just another average Starbucks nothing special. Only thing legit about this Starbucks is that they have outside seating area. And it seems comfortable other than that that's it
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~May 23, 2013~This is pretty funny - so I reviewed this place back in 2010 and an ex-employee (the guy who I placed the review about) commented on my review which I refuse to post.  But in a nutshell he said if I didn't get caramel in my drink then I probably didn't need it any way?  Hahaha!  Why would they have a caramel frap without the caramel?  Wouldn't I order something else?  I mean I know I don't `"need`" caramel in my drink but that's the purpose of ordering a caramel frap.  Wow!  Maybe that's the reason he no longer works there?  If you work at place where the recipe calls for sugar then it's probably best that you put sugar in the recipe.  Oh and he also said that  Arizona doesn't move 100 mph like California.  I don't understand what that has to do with making my drink?  I was the only one there waiting on a drink - he had no other orders, so it takes longer than 15 minutes to make an incorrect frap?  Any way....
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Nov 14, 2010~I went this Starbucks last night.  The service was awful!!!  I ordered a venti carmel frap.  The guy who made my drink, Kyle was flirting with these 2 girls and took forever with my drink!  Fifteen minutes later after I stood up looking for my drink he was pouring it in a cup and forgot to put carmel on it that he had to take the lid off to do that.  When we got out to sip our drinks there was NO syrup in it.  Straight expresso with ice!  This was bad!!!  I'm glad I live in California I will never have to visit this Starbucks again!!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jan 17, 2010~I've been going to this Starbucks for many years now and thoroughly enjoy going there to get my coffee fix.  While I'll agree that the parking can be a bit challenging during peak times I will say there is plenty of parkiing if you don't mind a short walk from the adjacent bank parking lot.As for the patio - I do not agree with the review that it is a smoky nightmare...haha - I have sat out there plenty of times with my family (including small kids) and have not had a hard time breathing.The staff of this Starbucks are some of the most friendliest people you will meet.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Sep 26, 2017~A Starbucks just like any other. This one has a great staff though that is friendly, efficient, and provides great customer service.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jun 22, 2018~This has to be the slowest, filthiest Starbucks in town!!!  Girl named Mickey was not only rude, and didn't know Starbucks customer service at all. Thank you for making me realize that not only did you just ask for a health inspection of your store, but also I will be talking to your regional manager about your attitude, professionalism, and customer service. Thanks for not giving me my refund, they can run the records on that specific day! Per Corporate. So that uncooked bacon you refused to refund, Corporate did so. Thanks again.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 7, 2015~This has been a local haunt since I we a kid. I've been coming here for over ten years and still enjoy it (I feel old). I like trying new places instead of just going to Starbucks all the time but it's close, wifi is always available, and it's open pretty late so why not come here? People are nice here and you see the same friendly faces, which is great. They renovated a few years ago and the design looks so much better. I can barely remember what it looked like before. If you've never been to a Starbucks before, here are my favs:-Iced white mocha with soy: sweet and wakes you right up-Flat white: a regular cup of joe with a little pizzazz-Chai tea latte either hot or iced with soy: something yummy and sweet without the coffee jolt-Mango iced tea: simple twist on a regular black teaEnjoy.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Nov 15, 2014~Still slow. Still sucks. Still forced come here because it by my house. Come here to view the wonder `"cup traffic jam`" on the counter at any given time.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Oct 17, 2014~This Starbucks is the slowest one I have ever been to, and lucky me I get to live right next door to it so I am forced to come here. As I type this update there 8 people in here.  I am on minute 11 of just waiting for a god damn ice coffee. All you have to do is put ice in a cup and add coffee. And as I type this I am now walking up to the counter to tell them they forgot to make my drink.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Dec 25, 2013~I've been coming to this Starbucks for over a decade now since it has the best outside seating of any coffee shop on this side of town. There are several unplanned groups of regulars who meet here most days of the week and a lot of smaller groups and individuals from the pharmacy college nearby who come to study. Quite a few friendly people and pretty girls. It's a nice place to hang out and drink and there's almost always an off-duty or uniformed police officer somewhere inside grabbing a drink. The staff is always friendly and knows your drink after just a couple visits. The recent renovations are also an improvement but it still definitely doesn't have enough seating sometimes. The patio outside used to be really bad because of smokers. So bad that I stopped coming here for a long time. They've mostly clamped down on people smoking now but people smoke outside after dark when the staff doesn't check anymore and there and even during the day, people cheat the system by standing just outside the fence to keep talking to their friends while they smoke, defeating the whole purpose of the smoking ban. Continued smoking irritation is the only reason it's not getting. 5 stars. If they fixed that, it'd be a great place. Start serving beer and I'd never leave.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Apr 6, 2014~Great coffee experience.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 27, 2017~Wow what a great little hidden gem of a Starbucks. Although I don't live nearby I will definitely be returning to this one. It has a great outdoor space that I would love to enjoy when it gets cooler. Erika was our barista and she was awesome. She had a great personality, was fun to talk to and had some great recommendations. Not to mention she was also fast and efficient, I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 15, 2019~8:15 Pm and they don't have decaf coffee.  I thought this was a coffee shop whose main product was coffee.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Mar 18, 2017~Stopped by this morning for a Trenta black tea lemonade. Customer service was terrible. Also they filled the entire cup up with ice I might as well just got a small. Not a  pleasant visit this morning.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jan 20, 2010~Good coffee, decent environment. Great for on the way to work. Right next to the 101.However Parking SUCKS!!!!!  Sorry, but its true.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Feb 25, 2017~Slooooowwwww!! Don't go to this location if you have less than 25 minutes to do wait. We went there with plenty of time and left running late!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Sep 7, 2014~Pretty much what we've come to expect from a Starbucks.Decent location with the usual fixings of great coffee, friendly staff, free wifi with inside and outside seating available.Seasonal selections for fall are always my favorite.Caramel frapacinno and caramel macchiato are my two favorite. Iced teas are always pretty good too.Parking located all around this location.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 14, 2013~I guess I caught them on a bad day - Monday at 12 noon. The barista was rude, slammed the change in my hand so it dropped everywhere on the counter, didn't bother to help me pick it up.Service was terrible: It took over 10 minutes for a standard order of a 12 oz. cup of iced tea. The staff is friendly to people 20 years of age or younger, but if you're older like me, forget about it. They cater only to a young crowd, and don't want business I guess from anyone else. Go elsewhere.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Mar 13, 2016~This Starbucks is pretty good until they get busy. When it's slow, they are very friendly and make sure your drink is made perfectly; 5 stars. Once things pick up, all is slammed together and the quality goes down. They got my order wrong again this morning during a rush. Sad part is that I had already left and now I've paid $5 for a coffee I don't like. Blah.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Nov 22, 2012~This location is conveniently located near the freeway.  It gets busy, but they are efficient and get the drinks out in a reasonable amount of time.  For how busy they get, they manage to keep the place reasonably clean and orderly.One of the prettier patios starbucks has in the valley.  I don't mind the smokers, but there have been a few times when a group of them sit next to me and billows of smoke come my way.  And its too packed to find another seat, especially since its has been 80 degrees in most of November.  It still doesn't deter me from enjoying the patio scene.Finding a seat is a problem during their peak times.  It would be great if they could take over the business next door and expand just a tad bit.  It can be hectic when the morning rush line forms, so this Starbucks could benefit with a little more room.Parking is not a challenge for me, even during their morning crush.  Compared to other Starbucks I have been to across the country, this one is really not too bad. You will have a problem if you are just aiming for the L shape lot directly in front of the door and the side. I usually go to the huge lot kitty corner to it (between kinder care and those empty businesses) or across to the bank lot, walk time is 20 maybe 40 seconds longer.  But maybe to your typical surburbanite in a hurry, it can be frusturating and challenging to get into the front row.Overall a good starbucks.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Oct 25, 2016~Inviting and casual atmosphere with great coffee and tea as well as tasty sandwiches. I love coming here to study as a student.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 24, 2015~This location is clean and the staff has always been friendly. It's on my way to my carpool so that is a plus! I like to have their ham and cheese for breakfast.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jun 1, 2014~Slowest Starbucks in history no matter how many people they have working. The best Starbucks in the area is at the frys at 59th or safeway at 67th. If the kiosks could give the reward drinks I would never have to go to a store again.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 19, 2018~Why the Mobil app if Coffee isn't going to be ready when you get there. Mobile app says 3 to 7 minutes I put it in 10 minutes before I even leave my house and it's still not ready. Also can never get anybody up front to hand the mobile order to you
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~May 3, 2010~Good service but there's always a lot of tools that sit on the patio all day and chain smoke.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Nov 5, 2012~My favorite Starbucks in the valley. Great patio and a great feel and energy inside. This place is always busy though. Good place to grab a coffee and hangout.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 31, 2015~I'm not a typical fan of Starbucks but today this place knocked it out of the park. Great job
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Aug 18, 2014~Great patio, extremely busy &amp; tight quarters inside. I always wish for a drive through at this location, overall clean &amp; efficient.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 16, 2015~This is an edit to my review posted...idk....two years ago. I love these girls! They know their regulars and remember their names. They always have a smile and say good morning. In my old review, I wasn't a fan of the staff and started going elsewhere. I love them now! They don't get confused if you change up your drink and they are pretty fast for how many online orders they get. Keep it up girls! Sometimes a male works there but they never stick around long :)
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Sep 14, 2014~Fantastic patio area.....as long as the weather is good! Friendly service with your standard Starbucks menu.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 16, 2014~Nice patio .. Nice to sit outside when weather cools.. good service
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~May 12, 2016~Slowest coffee shop I have ever been too. Takes 10-15 minutes to get a coffee. I think the second espresso machine is there for looks cause it never gets used...
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Nov 5, 2015~This Starbucks is okay. Depending on the employee who serves you. Some of them never greet you. I personally like to come when my friend works there. Everybody else isn't very good with customers and aren't very helpful with explaining drinks.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Dec 5, 2014~This Starbucks lacks good workers. They don't talk they just look at you when you try to make a joke or try to talk to them. I love when workers are full of energy talking and being loud. You make drinks. You can't be happy making drinks? Really that hard? Come on!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 4, 2014~Surprisingly relaxing find next to one of the former Blockbuster locations. Very attentive and friendly staff, and service is generally spot on. You could miss this one if you don't know where to look, but it's worth checking out.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 8, 2014~Nice comfortable Starbucks. We enjoy hanging out on the remodeled patio. Great staff. Jen is always smiling and helpful.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Aug 1, 2015~I love this location in the AM!  The staff is friendly and they know just how to make my drink.  I will say it can be a little hit or miss if you come later in the day or on a weekend.  Overall it's a good spot to get your caffeine fix.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 16, 2015~The staff here has always been pretty good - even when I brought another store's mistake to them to fix. The reason they get 5 stars is the patio.... huge, shaded with trees, and lots of seating. I love sitting outside here on a nice day!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Oct 17, 2015~First they got our orders wrong then they did not place the lid correctly on the cup the whole thing spilled over our seat and carpet when I ask for assistance they (Kevin)hand me two dry towels and did not offer any assistant to help did not even get apologies nor offered to help. Very poor service. Now I have to pay to clean the carpets.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Mar 18, 2013~This is a great Starbucks!  Huge patio on the east side in the shade. Some lounge seating inside.  Gotta stop for my espresso..
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Nov 28, 2014~I go to the Starbucks at frys and there's this teenager who works there and I asked for water. And then I came back 10 minutes later for a water again for my sister and she gave me a snotty look this is 3 - stars down
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Sep 1, 2015~Great place! The people are very nice! They always make my coffee just right. The great at following directions and super patient.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 20, 2014~Just like any other Starbucks, great drinks and great atmosphere. But the staff is excellent here. Cathy and Alexa were so helpful and went out of their way to give us great service. Refreshing smiles, even during the slow hours!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~4~Sep 2, 2021~SB inside a nice Safeway(shopping center at corner of Glendale Ave and N. 7th st.). The service was excellent. The two barista ladies were very professional. I subtract a star because after shopping for food, I wanted to sit down at one of the tables designated for the Starbucks counter and was told they were closed with closed signs. It was like that last time I was there as well.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Mar 8, 2021~The brand new brown sugar oat-milk shaken espresso was released last Tuesday. Now being a Starbucks barista myself, I know how to make this drink on my own. Upon receiving it when ordered at this location - I knew right away they made the drink incorrectly. Having the word shaken in the drink name you might expect to receive a drink that was shaken. The drink I received came out looking more like a macchiato and less like a shaken espresso. Let down - I tried the drink anyways only to not even taste sweetener in the drink. It tasted like an ice coffee without flavoring after I mixed the possible `"oat-milk`" and espresso shots.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Feb 9, 2022~Julie was by herself and still managed to have my 12 orders out super quick while helping other customers load gift cards. Very impressed!!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Apr 11, 2014~Teeny, Tiny Mobile Starbucks onsite at Safeway that offers all the wonderful drinks you would find at your traditional Starbucks locations. Even a free standing location has lots to offer. They have several tables and chairs to dine while you eat or drink your favorite Starbucks treat.This is the perfect addition to grab and go while you shop at your neighborhood store. They even recognize gold cards for all you frequent Starbucks drinkers who hold a status.Bake goods and other Starbucks munchies are onsite as well. Served by the same great Starbucks staff who love their patrons.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Jun 28, 2021~Horrible customer service. Slow. Slow. Gave this place a good 3 tries. Strike. Yo, Barista, try to  be a little more  discreet trolling on your TikTok
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Dec 22, 2019~This Starbucks makes the drinks amazingly.  I have a complicated drink request, and it usually has to be remade, but this girl on her first day, nailed it!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Jun 15, 2016~This location doesn't honor Starbucks Rewards, Birthday Drinks, or same day deals on receipts (ex: Granita/Trifle Sunset Menu).... Lame
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 22, 2024~My Go to Statbucks since 2019Lots of seating. Great MenuFriendly Baristas. Really like the storeManager. His Staff well trained
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 1, 2024~Most Wednesday Mornings I meetMy Spiritual Mentor at this location .In the 4th QUARTER OF 2023 we beganMy Journey with Larry to grow as a Christian.As long as I have lived in Phoenix. This locationFeels like HOME. Managers have hanged ,Barista's come and go. The Mission of a Starbucks Location is to provide an enrichingExperience drinking a variety of Hot and ColdCoffees along with Prepared Breakfast ItemsThis morning I ordered a Venti Veranda CoffeeWith a Bacon, Egg and Gouda heated Sandwich.Excellent . As usual there was a well represented of Coffee lovers , who came to do work on their Laptop before Going in to the Office and or meeting a Customer in the field !I have included a picture of me Corporately Dressed for an interview back 2020!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 30, 2023~This was the first Starbucks I visited when I moved to Phoenix. 5 years have come and gone! I love the service and food and coffee.Met many new friends here...Meet , pray, read and get to know others
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 30, 2023~Great coffee Bar! This was my Go To Place whenI first Moved To Phoenix. Across from PVMALL.Great Service , Great Coffee Almost 5 YearsAgo!. Times are different?Manager fun personality. Last week when they re-introduced  PumpkinSpice I got a free Sample Being hooked , I ordered onHomeyYeah atmosphere. Benjamin is the Manager.

Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 24, 2023~It has been years since I have written a review for this particular Starbucks Oasis. Yup , for me this particular store has fond memories. When I first moved to this area on 01/02/2019. My time in Phoenix amounted to 3 weeks. So this my usual Hang Out. It is across the road from the new building of Paradise Valley Condos and?For years this exact location was inside the Old Paradise Valley Mall. I met the Husband of AmyWho used to Pastor at PVCC. That is a share for another day?This morning I stopped by to earn my 100 points for this contest! Buy X Goodies over 5 days and earn 100 Bonus Reward Points.I ordered Cinnamon Coffee Loaf with a cup of Sumatra Hot Coffee with Oat Milk (Chilled).Great taste. No pictures Starbucks has been my Coffee Oasis of choice.Even when I was Back East in Forest Hills, Queens, NY.  Love to meet new people or catch up with others I know.Have a Blessed Weekend!! Happy July 4th!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 24, 2023~This is my Head Quarters in all of Phoenix.I have seen 3 Managers Come and Go!My favorite Barista that I know by name And they know me are (Righter's Block),REBECCA, CARLY , PATTI AND PAUL.4 years.

Do not know why , other than the water they use and the FRESH GROUDCOFFEE makes a Difference, FOR REAL!Became a Coffee Geek when I lived BACK EASTin Forest Hills, Queens. Néw York. I perfected the Introduction lead on and asked Each person to excuse my interruption. Genuinely interested in who they were. Love meeting New People. I would be Great as a BRAND AMBASSADOR? Hmm, now there is a thought. Does anyone know how I can travel across the country and share about a NATIONAL BRAND and DO PODCASTS?I am the MIDDLEMAN, which actually is my last name; no Pun intended.Starbuck's Coffee may not be for Everyone's taste . The experience can be worth the visit. Got to let people read your reviewsToday was a check in to see a dear friend who had skin surgery. He didn't share and I didn't ask. We spent an hour and he felt that he needed to get Home.Pictures don't tell what is behind my experiences , my words do. Have an awesome day! Happy Memorial Day!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 9, 2023~This is my HQ. Been a frequent customer forOver 3 1/2 years . Know Barista's by name.They know what I like . Professional Friendlyand great customer service(A++) Manager is awesome!Clean , roomy and well lit. Love to sit outside as well. #1 in my estimation
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 2, 2021~Been here for will be 3 yrs in December. Know the Manager. Great service ! Recognized many of the Baristas by name. Good rapport. Staff is well trainedto service customers
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jan 3, 2024~Slow down! My coworker brought me a Honey Citrus Mint Tea. It apparently spilled when it was being handed to her. She asked for a stopper but they were out.Before I finished I opened the lid because I noticed only one tea bag tab and the taste was a little weak. Guess what, the entire bag was in the cup. Not very hygienic. Slow down. I gave 3 stars because we all have challenging moments. Take your time. Breathe! Do your best.I couldn't finished. Next time will be better.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 2, 2023~I only frequent Starbucks when traveling as generally the hotel coffee is not very good.  Love the convenience of ordering via the app as well as accumulating points for future purchases to redeem.  This location was a fairly good size with plenty of parking (definitely needed for the behemoth of a truck we got as a rental).  Store was very clean and had around 6 or 7 employees.  Only downside is no one acknowledged me and were not friendly (experienced this same thing at a Palm Springs Starbucks last weekend).
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jul 5, 2023~I go to alot of Starbucks and spend alot of $ there because there customer service is usually great for one of the reasons. It's a very large company now with thousands of employees so I knew I'd eventually run into some bad ones and the Manager Ben at this one is the worst Starbucks employee I ever met.Over a year ago, I was in a hurry and left my cup on my table at their Bell and Tatum location. The manager at that time, Ben again, ran after me outside and ordered I go back inside and throw the cup away. I usually do clean up after myself as a courtesy but in my opinion customers are not obliged to clean their tables. This is part of the employees job when necessary. Starbucks is not cheap and thats part of the service.I told `"Ben`" I was not going back in to clean my cup off and bye.I posted a negative review on `"Ben`" for this incident as I believe it was totally out of line, as well as his demeanor, tone and phrasing was very aggressive and demanding after I already left the store.About a year later it turns out `"Ben`" is managing the SB at Thunderbird and 40th st. I didn't realize this until he jumped in my personal space and again demanded I clean one cup off the table as I was leaving. He even demanded we have a `"talk`" at the table that I must watch my behavior at `"his`" Starbucks if I want to remain a customer there. I told him I just won't go there anymore because I don't pay a premium for coffee to be harassed and treated so disrespectfully.Note: I have been going to Starbucks regularly since 1994 and have never dealt with a manager as rude as Ben and have never had anyone else tell me to clean my table. I usually do this anyway but on the rare times I leave something it's a cup or two and not my job to clean everything as all other employees understand apparently except Ben. He is literally the only manager I've encountered acting this way in my close to 30 years of Starbucks patronage spending thousands of my $$ at over 1000 Starbucks.Today, I go to this PV location looking to get out of the 115F heat for a cool drink and there is Ben again! I literally thought this guy was like Jack Nicholson in `"The Shining`". He was behaving in a very creepy, threatening way and jumped in my personal space again blocking my way shouting `"REMEMBER ME!!!`"I was seriously worried this guy would get violent and backed away and realized it was Ben from the Bell and Thunderbird locations(which presents the question why is he  moving around so much apparently other people have issues with `"Ben`").Note: I do know a Barista that recently left this PV location and now I know why apparently.After I realized this guy was the new PV manager, I told him `"I am leaving`" (not said because I don't go to Starbucks for drama and arguing with crazy acting staff). I asked him if he wasn't managing the Thunderbird location anymore(so maybe now it would be nice to visit again). Ben then said `"I know that Thunderbird manager`" which sounded like an implied threat to me that he would badmouth me.After I left, he apparently called a company called `"SS SECURITY`"(interesting name like another infamous SS)on me and the SS car actually followed me to another shopping center across the street. WOW.Note: I have done several years of sales and customer service including owning my own business with over 1000 customers as a professional portrait photographer and would never treat a paying customer like Ben behaved.If Ben acted professionally and had didn't have an integrity problem he would have said to me`" Hey Jon nice to see you here; I moved here from the other store. I overreacted and was rude to you a few times and apologize and here's a Frapp on me it's such a hot day.`" Now if Ben said that I would have accepted his apology because he would have behaved like a professional and an adult and would have not decided it was necessary to post another review on Ben.Ben gets my `"award`" for worst Starbucks employee I ever met. Fortunately, most are fine people so I am not blaming Starbucks for this lapse being a huge company. I will be lodging complaints to corporate in Seattle which will be a first for me in 28 Starbucks customer years.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 3, 2023~This is one of the best Starbucks in Arizona. The Staff does an outstanding job at a very busy location with a nonstop drive thru.The seating area is nice with a nice patio and the hours are until 8 instead 6 for many locations now.Highly recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 30, 2024~Slowest drive thru in the country!  ‍‍‍ I'm not sure if they are short staffed or what the issue, but I won't be coming back to this location
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 19, 2024~Asked for four waters, said thank you after each one and told the barista to have a good night. She simply ignored me. It isn't hard to say thank you
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 2, 2023~I was shocked at the low rating for this store...I come almost every day and it's ALWAYS fast, accurate, and the staff are so friendly!  They recognize my order in the drive thru, are so sweet to my toddler, and the food/drinks are always good.  I haven't combed through the reviews to see why it's rated so low, but I absolutely disagree...I think it's possible that because Starbucks is a chain, it's only reviewed when things go wrong (I've been guilty of that in the past myself) but in a time where this industry is struggling w staff and consistency, this location has always been
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Oct 1, 2022~Great drinks, but John needs to lighten up and maybe smile while taking drink orders in the drive-thru window.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 27, 2024~Worst starbucks I've ever been to. There were a couple ahead of me in line and I ordered two drinks. They took about 7 minutes through the drive through and they made me the wrong drink. When I asked for what I ordered, the heavy lady at the window said I'd owe another $.22 and they wanted the other drink back. It took so long and they messed up. I felt I should've been able to keep both and they should've fixed their mistake rather than taking it out on the customer.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 21, 2023~Friendliest staff I've ever come across at ANY Starbucks! So nice!!!  Been coming here off and on for years and always have the same experience!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 24, 2018~Came to the drive thru to order a drink. I got a grande caramel frappacino with no whip cream. When I was about to pay I saw she was holding a white drink &amp; i told her I didn't order that. She said I order a frappacino cream base, I never heard such a think &amp; it was definitely the opposite of what I wanted without whip cream. She did make me a new drink but I saw she was mad/upset that she had to remake a drink. They do have seating outside.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 31, 2023~I absolutely LOVE Gilbert and Hayleigh at this location. They are very sweet and efficient (plus, I've never had any issues with the food!). The whole staff is very kind and helpful.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 9, 2023~The food drinks and friendly service were a real treat!  The friendliest Starbucks, I have ever been to, and I used to go to the original Starbucks coffee shops in Seattle, 1000 years ago. Thanks crew!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 11, 2021~I was on my way to do a work drop and had to respond to some important emails so I pulled off at the closest Starbucks (this one!) to use their wifi and handle them! I ordered a tall vanilla cream cold brew (SO YUM) and really appreciated all of their outdoor seating! This is definitely one of the biggest patios that I've seen at a Starbucks to date. The service was so friendly and fast. The internet was speedy. They had everything that I needed! They also have a drive-thru which is always a plus. I would definitely come back here to get some work done on a nice AZ spring day! They currently do not have any indoor seating available, so if you go, plan to sit outside.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Mar 19, 2017~Raising to 4 stars because I made a mistake. I am a relative Starbucks newbie, and it seems the whipped cream melts really fast, so my order may have had it.-----Lol, it appears my 3 star rating may help this location raise their overall rating : )I am trying to not be biased just because I loved the 5&amp;Diner that used to be here before them.Not a big fan of Starbucks until recently, this was my first visit to this location.I used to stay away from Starbucks because I try to do low-carb and even their sugar free beverages may end up having tons of them.A few months ago I started asking for just plain coffee with heavy cream and I have bought more from them in the last year than in the past 20 years.Recently learned to place orders online, and my first experience was great at this Bethany Home and 16th St location. My second order at the PV Mall location did not go as well.My third order here, so-so. I love having the option to select my beverage and all ingredients on my mobile, and see the nutritional information right there. It also works great for me because I do not like my coffee very hot, and if I order online it is a little colder by the time I pick it up.This time I decided to try the Misto option (half coffee, half steamed mild). I never had it before, and it was almost what I ordered, it tasted great (great find!), but was missing the whipped cream, hence the 3 stars. I did park and walked in to pick up my order.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 15, 2022~Went to Starbucks today they know I have cancer and they did something really nice for me gave a nice drink they are the best.  Drive the extra mile to visit this location the best I thank you wonderful Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 18, 2023~The food and drinks are good, but the service is absolutely terrible. If you ever are served by Larcy, then get out lmao. Went there on my birthday after getting an email from the starbucks rewards for getting my free drink, but apparently it wasn't automatically added on the rewards app, so Ms. Larcy wouldn't let me get the drink for free, despite me showing her the email confirming that I, indeed, deserved the free drink. I also offered to show her my ID but she refused and said she couldn't do anything because there was no button for her to push on her screen that would allow me to get the free drink. F you Larcy.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Sep 7, 2018~This is a very nice Starbucks location in a major mall located in Old Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area.  We ordered two coffees and were very happy with our drinks.  The half and half at the coffee prep area was empty and it took a little time to get a fresh decanter...no biggie!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Mar 3, 2018~There are three Starbucks in this general vicinity, but this is the real one (not in a mall, not in a grocery store, not in a discount store).Pretty big store inside and completely packed with no open tables, so we asked to share.  If you are coming here to study or hang out with a group, it might be difficult to find a place on a regular basis.This location does have a Clover, so you won't find the exclusive coffees on the drip. You'll have to order the reserves from the Clover.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jul 24, 2018~First Starbucks have been to in a long time where the guy taking my order was very blase and borderline rude. When I asked a question about a new drink he looked at me like I was an idiot. I don't normally come into Starbucks because I would much rather support local business, but I will send the pass every time I've come into one they are all incredibly well-trained and very happy. In fact, I know a manager at Starbucks so I know that their training handbook is one of the best. So pretty disappointing to have that kind of service
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 13, 2021~I love this place. I go here several times a week before work. They're always polite, fast, and accurate with my drink. I have to have drinks made dairy free and they have never, ever messed that up. It's also a great place to hang out.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 28, 2022~Awesome friendly staff even when busy. Above and beyond most Starbucks locations. Wifi hasn't let me down yet either
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jun 15, 2019~Kinda dirty...it's a relatively new store, so not sure why. Mentioned a few egregious areas (bathroom and serving counter) I was met with indifference. McDonalds have crappy bathrooms as well. Just saying.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Mar 4, 2017~This is my neighborhood location and while there was already one inside of the PV Mall and Target this one is perfect. The outside seating area is my favorite. So much more comfortable than sitting inside. This staff here is pretty cool too! Weekday mornings I definitely utilize the drive thru, and any other time it depends on my mood and how much time I have. Gotta love that they're open early and close late at this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Mar 2, 2019~Very busy Saturday Morning at this location...I know the employees are doing the best they can....had to wait a while between getting our sandwiches and getting our specialty coffee. Loved the bacon croissant sandwich! Only major issue is nats inside the food display case.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 18, 2022~Super friendly staff, especially the sweet girl at the drive-thru window, and a perfectly made brown sugar latte! A refreshing experience!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 17, 2020~Customer service as I walked in not a smile not a greet not a happy person and the gentleman that waited on me was absolutely one of the most non-personal customer service reps I've ever dealt with at Starbucks. I ordered a cold brew with almond milk cold brews usually have ice not a drop of ice in there. The coffee was probably one of the worst coffees  I've had at Starbucks. Definitely won't be back to this location what a disappointment it's not like it's a dollar cup of  coffee. Thus was $5.15 After seeing your reviews maybe you guys need to work on some customer service at this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 1, 2018~What's up at this Starbucks location. Took 15 minutes to get an iced soy latte and it wasn't even busy. No one seemed to care or even try, honestly. Starbucks is known to get you your Joe so you can get on with your day, not this location....If you want to waste your time, go to this location, guaranteed to happen.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 9, 2018~Starbucks is Starbucks and this one is consistent with the rest of them. Every time I'm here the staff is extraordinarily friendly and they all seem to know what they're doing. It's nice and new and very clean. I really enjoy the outdoor seating. It's in a giant parking lot but that can't be helped since it's next to the mall and the cushions are quite comfy. Ordering food in the drive-through line can definitely mean that you'll be sitting for a while, but that's pretty standard too.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 7, 2020~This loud mouth obnoxious woman Theresa ruins the whole morning. She walks in screaming and screams the whole time. I try and not come here when she is working but she came in after I was already here. I'm leavening now and going to 32 Shea! Can't stand this broad! I can't believe she keeps her job!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 23, 2019~There are two baristas here that ruin the whole experience. Never been in a Starbucks that is so loud and these two scream all the time I'm here. They think they are the stars I guess! Big mouth loud baristas. One gal one guy! I'm finding a new place till these two are gone. The rest of of staff is wonderful. It's too  bad these two obnoxious folks ruin the place!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 21, 2021~I was looking up what time this Starbucks opens in the morning and I was shocked to see the low rating. I felt like I had to leave a review. I have had lots of good experiences at this Starbucks. I've been coming here since I moved to the neighborhood in 2019. I usually come here before work in the morning and they are usually quick, accurate and efficient at getting my order out to me either through the drive thru or the mobile order pickup. There is usually a barista (I think his name is Patrick?) who works in the AM and he is always happy and positive and puts me in a good mood before my work day.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 18, 2020~Best Starbucks ever, friendly staff and costumers. We really like Teresa! She knows everyone's name. Reminds me of the TV show Cheers with the bar where everyone knows your name. Maria has a good team and your drink is made quickly and correctly. Love all the baristas. Good place to just hang.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Dec 3, 2020~I enjoy a nice fresh bagel. I like the extra butter. Also can't go wrong when a friendly barista hands me a cold grande frap.Thank you Starbucks I'm loving it right now!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 2, 2016~This is my favorite Starbucks in the immediate area. I've always gotten a greeting with a smile from Alex, Maria,  and Pat.I usually mobile order when I am in a hurry. The drive thru line is popular, but there are plenty of parking spots if you don't mind walking just a few feet inside. In some locations this would be a huge hassle but it's easy peasy here. If you are driving north on Tatum, this is right after Chili's.Patio area is inviting.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 12, 2019~I pray that you never bump into Teresa she is the rudest woman I've ever seen provide customer service rudely cutting me off to not finish my sentence jumping into finishing my words as if she knows what I will order and got it wrong because she kept cutting me off , Dennis is the Man you need to make your drink from he's got class!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Nov 22, 2016~Worst customer service ever at a Starbucks location. I've been to this location on multiple occasions. My drink has never been right and it always takes forever to get it made. As a new store I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt in the beginning, but they've been open long enough now to have learned the Starbucks process.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 19, 2017~New to the area and been here a few times. The staff has always been friendly, and welcoming. My coffee and or food orders come out quickly. My only peeve here is the Wifi.   Slow as molasses even when not busy/full.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 7, 2020~SLOWEST STARBUCKS IN THE WORLD!!! I am a very patient person have worked in different food service industries but oh dear it took 25 minutes to get drinks we ordered through the app. People who came in after us and ordered in line got their drinks first, when I finally got my first drink I nicely said oh I had a second just to make sure I was going to get it and the lady (she had red hair) snapped back at me ITS COMING. Overall one of my worst experiences at Starbucks will not go back to this location!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 10, 2019~Stopping by early in the morning this week I thought maybe I was tired. However this morning I watched a custoner storm off with frustration. The staff is mixed and doesn't work together. Needs training ....
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 14, 2016~Worst customer service I have ever received. there were only 2 cars in front of me and it took longer than 10 minutes each car; it was 3pm, not a very heavily busy time but whatever. Anywho, it's finally my turn and the young lady comes to the window. Runs my card and said its not reading. I asked her to run it again because it is a new card and I have never had problems with it not working. So I ask her if she tried typing it in? With amazement she says `"I can't type it in because if I type it in wrong and it charges someone else, they could come after me and I could get sued.`" Stunned. I also work in the customer service industry for over 9 years and have not once ever heard of this blasphemy. make sure you get the numbers right before you send it then... after me asking her to run my card which seems like the 3rd or 4th time she finally runs it again and it goes through. All I could think was b*tch.. I'm never coming here again.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Nov 10, 2019~I love Starbucks and i think the coffee and drinks are great. However, this specific location is extremely slow. Their window time per car was at least 3-5 minutes so it took quite awhile to get through the line.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 21, 2019~This location sucks. Every other location doesn't charge me a whole cup for almond milk with my oatmeal. I just wanted a little splash on the side. That's complete Bs. Won't be here again .
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Feb 14, 2020~A solid Starbucks. It's a cool space. But the wifi is always abnormally slow here, to the point that I create a hotspot from my phone to get work done sometimes. The staff is real friendly! But wifi is pretty important at a coffee shop.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 11, 2018~I just have to say what awesome customer service I got today. I was out with my two year old daughter and they could see I had my hands full with her and helped me out so much.  I feel bad I wasn't able to tip because I was chasing her out the door as we left, while carrying our drinks. So I hope this 5 star review helps you all. Thanks for your help today!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 4, 2016~I was so excited when they open this new location so close to my home! Took longer than it should for a fast in and out experience expected at Starbucks-  hence the four stars instead of five, but they are brand-new. I know I will be here again and will do an updated review.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Mar 6, 2021~Messed up the order and shut the window so we couldn't ask for it to be fixed. I just wanted a matcha late and they gave me a coffee that was bitter and black. I hardly ever go to Starbucks but every once in a while I try to give it a fair shot. I think this is the last time. :/ I hope they are able to get it together at some point.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 3, 2019~This location continues to disappoint me. They mess up my order like 75% of the time and always seem to take way longer than other. Such a bummer, I continue to return to be patient and every time I question why I return :(.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jun 25, 2016~I walked in at 7 AM and, amongst the four employees, I was not at all greeted, which I understand; they're busy or whatever.  But wait-- they're not busy; I am the only person in the place.  They're ignoring me!  There is a family eating outside but nobody else inside. Perhaps the drive-thru is busy?  Nope.  Maybe one car at the most.  Not sure why they felt the need to go about their business like nobody was in their line. So after I check to make sure I'm not invisible, I wait a good five or six minutes before I speak up &amp; I'm actually acknowledged by the barista who says, `"have you been helped?`"  You can't write comedy this good! 6/26/16 - Gave this place another shot (drive-thru this time) and boy did I regret it; worst tasting, most sour iced coffee I've ever had and the cup had something gross smeared on the side. No thank you!

Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 29, 2018~I would give this location a 10 out of 10 if I could! They are absolutely amazing here, they never get my order wrong no matter how busy it gets. And their costumer services is exceptional! This morning I went through the Starbucks drive through  around 8:30 am (where it's usually the busiest) and I got all the way up to order and realized I have left my wallet at home, I then tell the person who was taking my order that I left my wallet and I'mGoing to pull forward so the next costumer can order. The Starbucks worker told me that she will cover my order and to get whatever I would like! Because she knows it happens to the best of us! It was the sweetest thing that has ever happened to me at the drive through! Never go to another Starbucks I promise you that you won't regret it !! She definitely deserves a raise! She represents the company very well! (Her name is Amanda)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Mar 26, 2019~Really clean. Friendly staff. The WiFi is really slow. Makes it hard for me to want to come back because it slows my work down immensely.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 27, 2020~Service was lethargic and unenthusiastic. After walking in, and with full staff on hand not to mention, it took 10 minutes of standing in line to be asked if we were ready. A small amount of customer satisfaction was provided, as well as refusing to allow a reward redemption. Hands down the worst Starbucks I have been to in a very very long time.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 4, 2017~Slow rude service! Unbelievable! Three baristas and still took longer than person who ordered 10 minutes after our order.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 5, 2020~Andy behind the counter at the PV Mall location has got to be one of the worst customer service employees I have ever seen in the retail and food industry. If you ever come in the evenings you have no choice but to have your order taken by him and served by him. He works no other position but register. You would think this would be the last position to put this person, to be the face of the store for customer service.  His presentation is horrible, his hands are dirty, and he seems to be on drugs half the time, as well as rude to customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 3, 2017~Friendly and quick service through the drive-thru. Fresh beverages at the usual Starbucks' premium price. Excellent audio from the ordering panel though. It sounded like the guy was IN there! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 27, 2019~The ladies at this location stand at the coffee machine can gab. Mobile orders don't get processed and when you show up your empty handed. It happens on a frequent basis that i just go to Dutch Bro, McDonalds, or another location. Tired late starts to my morning so the staff can chat in lieu of doing job.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 11, 2019~I did a drive thru today and Eris(sorry if I misspell it) help me out. I ordered a venti caramel frap + 1shot, green tea frap, caramel frap + 2 shots, and a black tea no sugar. I even confirmed before I drive up to pay `"that's 4 drinks total, right?`" Eris say `"yes`". When I pay and get my drinks, I only received 3. I was like `"I ordered 4 drinks`" she was like `"what's?!?`"... no sorry, no apologize, even about to argue with me too.Ring me up my 4th and I pay. Dear manager, please give ERIS some coffee seem like she could use some!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 17, 2017~I have visited this Starbucks several times this year, every time the customer service has been poor, to their initial greeting and everything in between. My order is always wrong, when I correct the order, I get an attitude about it as if I am to blame. I think they are trained to be rude.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 7, 2016~Worst Starbucks ever. Incredibly slow. When I drove up it was obvious the coworkers where in a tiff with each other which was awkward and uncomfortable.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 19, 2019~I live around the corner, their coffee is good 1 visit out of ten!! Most of the time it is like warm water with a little cream, terrible, don't waste your money or time waiting in the drive thru for 10 minutes or more. Maybe they don't brew long enough.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 11, 2019~One of the worst locations I've been to. Drinks are incorrect 90% of the time and come out sticky and messy. How hard is it? Employees definitely need customer service training and learn how to work as a team. Called customer service and was on hold 36 minutes. Dutch Bros. Is around the corner. Much better coffee and always happy to have you!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 20, 2016~The drive through is incredibly slow. Not to mention they are always out of there `"freshly`" baked goods at exactly 9:30 in the morning. Get it together Starbucks, you have a rush of people around that time. Poor team management in my opinion, there's plenty of people willing to take your money but only one person willing to make and give you your coffee or if your lucky enough to get food.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 16, 2019~The people who work here are amazing and they do the best that they can especially during a rush. Every single employee I have come into contact with are super friendly and very helpful. Great service and great drinks! Definitely will be coming back
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 9, 2016~I have now given this Starbucks four or five tries. every time it  has been poor customer service a 10 minute wait in the drive-through line when no one is in front of us and the worst coffee. Whether an iced Americano, iced coffee, or vanilla latte all taste awful. Coffee is either bitter or no coffee taste at all. I would not recommend it... stay away!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 27, 2019~I purchased a coffee and sat at a table to work on homework and my stomach became upset after drinking about half of the venti iced coffee. I went to use the restroom and soon had a worker pounding on the door threatening to call the police because I had `"been in there too long`".
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 20, 2019~This has to be one of the rudest and disrespectful starbucks I've ever been too, they couldnt even get my order right which is weird because all I wanted is steamed milk foam in a americano and they mess up making my drink 3 times after waiting 10 mins I had to ask for a refund. What's worse is the leadership here when asked to talk to the manager she replied  that she was the shift supervisor in charge. Definitely not coming back.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jun 22, 2016~Slowest, most unorganized, Starbucks, I've been to. Very nice building great location, but!!!Today 6/22/16 we visited this location for the third time, each visit was slower than the one before.We believed because it was a new location they would get better, but that's not happening, this is our last visit.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 21, 2017~This is absolutely my new favorite Starbucks in the area! After numerous dismal encounters at the PV mall location, and weary of driving farther for better service, I had sworn off Starbucks for quite a while. Like more than a year. Even tried DB for a period of time. Happy to say that this location is friendly, fast and gets my order correct without 20 questions about my life story (sorry Dutch Bros, you are awesome but too nosy). Love the convenience of the drive thru and the drinks served up with a smile!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jan 6, 2019~I've been here a couple times and my orders are never right or there's something that's not supposed to be my drink. A black tea with remnants of fruit from a drink previously, or just recently I ordered coconut milk because I have an intolerance to milk and my drink was made with lactose instead. The staff is really friendly even when there's a rush and always welcome customers in. So I guess just make sure when you receive your drink it's what you ordered otherwise the place is quite nice.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 24, 2016~Poorest SB ever. Dirty, trash over flowing, flys everywhere. Slow service with one poor guy doing walk in and drive thru. For the $10 i gave them for 2 drinks you think they could put some work into this recent new location that is now a pit. We will not return.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 26, 2018~Extremely slow there is no sense of urgency. If you are going make sure you have about 30 minutes to spare.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Apr 5, 2018~Don't do a mobile order for this store.  They say that mobile orders are a priority.  However seeing the line in the store,  I placed my order.  Went in and  waited a few minutes.  Received my food,  then watched as every person who walked in after I did, placed their order received their drink and walked out.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 28, 2017~I've only been to this location twice so far, but both times I've gotten great friendly service and yummy drink. I really like this location because they're patio seating is very nice.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 15, 2016~This is absolutely the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. The coffee and espresso is always burnt. This place has only been open a few months and I doubt it survives long enough to pay the franchise fees. Again do not go to the Starbucks under any circumstance. Worst coffee you will ever have. Ever!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 26, 2017~When we walked through the door a guy named Alex (black slicked back hair) was behind the register looked at us I smiled at him he rolled his eyes grabbed a broom and began to sweep. Not a problem I thought they must be busy... so we stood there with no hi, someone will be with you in a minute, I'm sorry for the wait, no nothing. We stood there completed ignored for at least three minutes and my fiancé even asked if I wanted to go to a different location. Then Alex and blondie started talking amongst themselves about problem solving across the counter while still not even looking at us... haha great problem solving by making the costumers feel like they don't exist. I did interrupt them and asked `"is no one going to help us?`" Blondie rolled her eyes at me Alex stood there dumb founded he had to actually do talk to customers. I was so fed up with the attitude so I gave them attitude back telling them this is bullshit and walked out. I will be calling back for a manager.

We live right next to this location but if it is going to be like this we will gladly go out of our way to get decent customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 12, 2018~I'm done going to this location. The customer service there is by far the absolute worst out of every surrounding Starbucks in the area. I don't know his name but the bald male with the dark beard should be fired! I cannot tell you enough how many times I have come through the drive thru with him taking my order and every single time I receive nothing but rude snappy service. He needs to lose his EGO and his JOB. The tone he uses should be unnacceptable and today he cut me off short after ordering my beverage and sure enough they ended up getting my order wrong. And that was after waiting in the drive thru for well over 10 minutes. Slow and rude service, dont waste your money or your time when there are many other locations to choose from although it's a bummer because this one is closest to where I live. I won't be coming back and I'll be spreading the word about the unprofessional service
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~May 13, 2017~This is my favorite location not just because I live within walking distance. It's always clean, the staff are smiling and once I was given a generous sample of the single-origin coffee I came in to purchase, but they were sold out of. Only once did I have a negative experience where I was standing by the counter waiting for someone to return to the register to take my order when another customer came in not knowing there was a line (ie: ME) and a staff member zoomed over to take his order, not even acknowledging that I was waiting first.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 10, 2017~Terrible customer service... The employees would rather gossip than acknowledge you. Spend the extra two minutes and go to a different Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Aug 3, 2017~Roach crawling on the floor in the ladies restroom. I was told by a patron it was probably a water beetle but none the less it was a big bug crawling on the floor
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 26, 2016~Please someone help these people learn how to make a cup of coffee without burning it. Coffee here tastes like boooty
Phoenix, AZ 85051~4~Jan 3, 2024~Nice Starbucks location, you can find Food City and Five Below in the same plaza. The service is great and most of the time accurate. If you're a college student, keep in mind this location does NOT have tables or chairs. This location is very small. My favorite part is the two mobile order parking spaces in the front of the store. It helps out especially if there's a long drive thru line.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Apr 27, 2022~They just recently opened like 2 weeks ago and I've personally had great service from the staff, they are friendly and welcoming . There sitting area is always clean and the restrooms! They did let me know that their Café Opens at 6am and closes at 5pm, (since I had a Mobile Order and decided to get down at 5:45am but with no problem I went through the Drive Thru) I believe since is for the safety of the staff since this area personally is not the safest at dark hours.  I will be visiting this Starbucks for sure!
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Aug 5, 2022~Very nice experience visiting this Starbucks!! Driving through on vacation and needed a pit stop. Found this Starbucks, glad we did. The location was clean and found staff to be friendly.  Ordered my drink with Kaylan, she was very nice. Asked to use the restroom, she said of course. Very pleased with this Starbucks!! My drink was correct... No issues.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Dec 10, 2023~They just ripped me off. 1/2 cup full. Are you kidding me!Shameful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~May 11, 2024~Fast. Friendly. Clean. They make sure your orders are correct. If there is an issue, they are courteous and quick to fix! Food/drink prepared when ordered. This location is the `"Cheers`" of coffee shops!! Manager is exceptional. His employees are top notch!
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~Oct 30, 2023~Morning drive-thru...my Venti order wasn't full to cup size, shortchanged me with a Grande size fill. Tap water warm coffee...beware of the drive-thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~4~Mar 15, 2024~Drinks were good, the lady was nice who was there. The guy was a bit of a ditz but was doing his job well!
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Dec 17, 2022~I will NEVER go to this Starbucks again. I asked for water in my personal Starbucks bottle. Employee took my bottle, then a female came to the window and stated that they are unable to fill up my water bottle because I'm in the drive thru, I must go through the cafe and it is in their policy. The male barista had taken my water bottle inside the store. He hands me an ice water in a plastic cup that I did not order. First off, I did not ask for a water with ice. Secondly, what about reducing plastic is that not Starbucks mission? I'm so hurt that the employees discriminated me at the window. What difference does it make if I go through the cafe and drive thru? I have never experienced this, I go to Starbucks around the valley daily!!!! I even tipped them... how sad that I'm unable to receive the basic necessity, of water, in my Starbucks bottle.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Nov 19, 2023~Recently Starbucks decided to become greedier and start charging $1 more for the drink I normally get which is a venti mango dragon fruit refresher LIGHT water no inclusions. They told me that because I was doing light water there was an additional charge as I was receiving `"more`" of their product. I told them that I always get this beverage and should I then ask for a discount as I'm not including their fruit and to their logic I'm consuming less of their `"product`". Regardless when I got my cup it read, no water. I never stated I wanted no water. I went to my reg Starbucks and they clarified that it's for no water drinks not the light water drinks which only annoyed me more. Starbucks get it together please. This place didn't even make my order right since there are no strawberries in my drink. I also stated light water multiple times. I added previous orders to further prove my reg order.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jul 14, 2022~Very bad service I ordered on the Mobil app and all of my drinks came HALF FULL!! I also ordered a venti and received a grande ver disappointed in this location I recommend any other location except this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Sep 23, 2022~Ok now the lobby closes at 3pm!? Wth!? Have to wait an additional 20 mins for a mobile order is totally unacceptable.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~3~Oct 2, 2022~So first I have to say this is a Starbucks location I visit multiple times a week and have since they opened a few months ago. I've never had a problem. My coffee always tastes great, store is clean, batistas are always pleasant. My issue is on a recent Friday after I picked my son up from school we both needed a afternoon pick up. Mobile order My coffee and his Frappuccino. Pull in walk to the door to find it locked with a sign that the cafe closes at 3. So I get in the drive thru line, with about six cars ahead. Wait. Wait. Get to the order kiosk tell the girl I have a mobile order. She says ok thanks. Wait about another 10 minutes, mainly because the lady in front of me had like 6 Frappuccinos. Now when we get our order I ask the drive thru attendant if they have a walk up procedure for mobile orders and she says no, you have to wait in line. Why mobile order? By the time my son received his white chocolate Frappuccino it was half melted. Sigh. I like this Starbucks, I like the employees but the app should have some sort of disclosure you must wait in the drive thru line after 3. It'll still be on moist several times a week in the morning coffee run but not in the afternoon.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Apr 24, 2022~This Starbucks location claims to be open until 10 pm. Only if you order online or use the drive thru. I live a block away, so I decided to walk there with my daughter since she loves Starbucks. To our surprise, the lobby closes at 5 pm everyday (even though the hours of operation clearly state 10 pm on the door sign) The employee came to the door and unlocked it to tell us to either order online or bring the car.... I doubt this is a staffing issue, since there were 4 employees inside and this is a pretty small location. This is a brand new location, and l understand this neighborhood might not be the nicest at night, specially the street intersection but c'mon... don't open a business that has a sitting area if you are afraid to have it open. Since I don't plan to drive a block, work from home and get off work after 5 pm, I won't be visiting this Starbucks ever.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~May 24, 2023~The guy at the window was soo rude, forgot one of our items and then dropped it when handing it to me.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jul 5, 2022~They might want to put on the app that the lobby is closed at 5 and you must make the long line to get your mobile order.  I place an order and still had to wait an additional 30 min, so that's 30 min of my drink sitting there. At least be like other locations that have the pick up location window
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~May 2, 2022~I like this coffee store very clean and most people is polite however and unfortunately last time visit for a mobile order they didn't make me feel with the same welcoming experience. my mocha cookie frappe came with a huge piece of ice which is about 1/4 of the cup Anyway I will keep coming to the store, accidents happen all the time so it be nice if next time they keep that in mind.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Apr 24, 2022~Barely 8:00pm. Placed an online order to pick up and their lobby was closed. I had to wait almost 30 minutes to get my drinks that were already sitting there for 30 minutes and won't even taste the same. Like come on.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Dec 3, 2023~Location is so so. You see a lot of people walking around who appear to be homeless or on drugs.I quickly walked inside, and the interior of the Starbucks is nice and clean. It's modern and updated and well-maintained. I ordered via mobile order on the app and by the time I got there which was seven minutes later my order was ready !I do hope they clean up the area as I feel like it takes away from the Starbucks.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Nov 12, 2024~On Veterans Day you offer only giving regular coffee? If you advertise to give a free coffee to our servicemen then make it worth the visit and you should allow them to pick what they want. You suck!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 21, 2024~Service for drive through is horrific.  I honestly think they make the drinks after you pay!  Not mention out several items.Don't waste your time at this location.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 13, 2024~Went in for an iced matcha at 6:30pm 09/13/2024 and when i received my drink it wasn't shaken at all! There was so much matcha chunks floating around so then i asked them to reshake it for me. when i got it back it was still the same..like what did you do to it ? you think i wouldn't have noticed you guys didn't do nothing? paid 8 bucks for a grainy iced matcha smh.
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Jan 5, 2023~Hit or miss cause sometimes my items are not ready until long after the promised time. I tend to order through my app and pick up in store. For some reason my banana walnut loaf does not come warmed like I order so I switched to the cheese danish.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Nov 6, 2022~Extremely busy location, espresso has a burnt taste almost every single time unfortunately. The drive thru entrance can be accessed through only one way, there is normally a `"do not enter`" sign on the other side. The inside is very crowded, people were standing in front of the mobile pick up area making it hard for me to get my drink and return to vehicle. This Starbucks is across the street from GCC, I'm assuming that's why it's so packed. I've tried to give this location several chances but I'm truly let down. I rather drive to 35th Ave and Glendale.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Dec 9, 2023~This Starbucks is one of the closest ones to my house, but I avoid it as much as I can. I have never been to this drive through without waiting at least 20 minutes, even when there are only a few cars in front of me. The employees are nice when I get to the window but so slow at making the drinks. The slowest drive through I have ever been to, every single time.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jun 3, 2023~Worst service ever. GirlWith the short purple hair was rude because I asked if she can re make the frappe I order since it was all water down. She ya Med the cup from my hand and proceeded to make other order to make me wait longer. Waited about 10 mins for one frappe. Very disappointed!!!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 27, 2023~From 8:25am-9:01am I was getting my 1 basic iced DRINK! RETRAIN! LOOK HAPPY! CHECK EXP DATES OF MILKS! Starbies Management needs to retrain the baristas again! Two were not friendly, looked irritated to be at work and didn't smile at all. It hurt me to watch them here. No my usual store I frequent but today confirmed I will not be going back. I was in the drive thru at 8:25am, 4 cars ahead of me to place an order at the speaker. It was my turn at the speaker at 8:38am, I finally paid for my order 5 min after that. Iced venti wht mocha, oat milk w/whip and light ice. SIMPLE. Payment was scanned as I watched my drink sit at the window for 2 minutes while the window barista did everything else except hand me my drink. I finally got it and concluded my drive thru visit at 8:46am. I routed out of the parking lot and drove over the intersection to finally taste my drink- IT WAS SOUR! I mixed it and tried again- MY STOMACH TURNED. For a $7.88 drink, I made a U-turn and went back, parked, went inside to the mobile order/hand out bar where a male barista with blonde/brown curly hair and glasses was at the espresso machine and stood there looking at him until I was noticed- that didnt happen so I said excuse me and held up my drink and said `"can you remake this please, its very sour`"- He said no words to me as he grabbed my cup, took the sticker off and said- you can throw that. I stood there and waited for my drink. He passed out 2 other drinks as I waited for my remake. He placed the drink on the bar and said here you go and that was it. No sorry, not checking the oat milks to see if they were expired NOTHING! I did not throw my expired drink away because the barista is to do that. I made it back in my car at 9:01...From 8:25am-9:01am I was getting my 1 basic DRINK! I am a Vet barista with years experience from 10 years ago so I know the standards of Starbucks' customer service, I know the mission and values along with the Starbucks experience. THIS WAS NOT IT TEAM! They are lucky I wasnt a mystery customer to rate them because they would not have a good rating. I will be reporting this store.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Feb 6, 2022~Drove OUT OF MY WAY to use their bathroom &amp; buy breakfast &amp; their lobby/bathrooms are CLOSED. Yes Covid is still happening but the situation has changed w/ people getting vaccinated, wearing masks, etc. WTH?! Every SB I go to is fully operational: the location is open, bathrooms are available &amp; patrons can order AND eat/drink/meet inside the building as well as drive thru open. What the hell?I didn't waste my money buying breakfast/coffee there. Staff were not helpful/friendly. AZ HQ needs to assess this site - definitely not operating up to Starbuck's standards.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 12, 2024~Starbucks is normally customer friendly but today was a different story. Not sure if it was because they were so busy because of the bogo deal.  When I walked in they told me there was a bit of a wait. I waited 45 min and left without a drink. When talking to the manager to ask for a refund, she came off as very callous as if she didn't care. I understand it might have been a rough day for her but you don't project your day on to the customers. Especially if they have been waiting without complaining for 45 minutes.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Aug 29, 2023~Not open 24 hours . Drive thru blocked for an undisclosed period of time . Oh well ....
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Apr 2, 2024~If you hate your job then quit lol. don't say that i was disgusted by my drink when i never said that, you just made it wrong and i corrected you. next time you want to talk shit about a customer literally standing right there to your coworkers, maybe next time wait until they leave . or maybe you need another day of training learning how to make a drink!
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Feb 18, 2023~Slowest Starbucks on the planet. Coffee is Starbucks quality and worth it if you have time to kill. If not, choose a different coffee place.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 23, 2024~i went there just about 30 minutes ago it was supper busy which i expected because the fall menu just came out yesterday. i ordered a caramel macchiato with pumpkin sauce &amp; cold foam . As soon as i got my drink handed to me i knew it wasn't right , there was NO pumpkin sauce at all theyre was coffee ground itty bitty bits in my coffee it tasted so black i have never had a caramel macchiato that tasted like that before , i tasted no pumpkin at all ! why did i pay 8$ for a regular caramel macchiato . very confusing and upsetting, it was so busy i didn't even bother to go back inside . i will not be returning to this location again
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jul 8, 2023~Any time I have been to this location I've had the worst experience ever. The line is consistently a 20+ minute wait regardless if you are inside or in the drive thru. Additionally, the employees are not kind, do not acknowledge me when I walk into the lobby, and make me feel like a nuisance when I order. They make no effort to make a connection with the customer. As a previous Starbucks employee I would be embarrassed to how this store is run.  I would not recommend this location to anyone. BBC
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 4, 2023~Look at this cup! Barely filled up! Since when is it ok to fill up cups barely and pay so much! My cup was filled up the exact same way! I asked the gurl to fill it up and she added ice to it! Then I said wow so your just gonna add ice! She says`"yup`"!!! Then 1 minute later asked what my name was and took another 15 minutes to get my daughters drink out! This is pathetic!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jul 29, 2024~this is for ALL starbucks but this is the location i most recently had. starbucks has gone so far downhill, let's be honest, the coffee actually sucks arse and does not deserve to be $10 each. which is absolutely RIDICULOUS. starbucks used to be the best goto coffee spot and it just has turned ghetto and expensive. dutch bros is way more bang for your buck i would recommend trying this place out if your a starbucks hater like myself.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jun 1, 2022~Wow we were headed across town. I haven't been down Olive in ages! We've been to Peacock Park a few times with the tots but hadn't been this far south to notice. There used to be a Chevron gas station here. One of my girlfriends in high-school used to pump gas for customers and wash their windows. It was a unique service they offered there. Once fueling our cars it now fuels humans with yummy drinks in hundreds of options! Perfect for GCC students to chill. Looks a lot nicer than places in the area that are in thr surrounding shopping center. Service was fast and friendly. They had no issues making everyone's drink in a timely manner and we had a big group!
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Nov 8, 2023~Do not come to this startbucks if you are in a rush.  Friendly staff but slow lines.  If the holiday flavors didn't just drop, I wouldn't wait 30 minutes in line for any drink.  But that Caramel Brulee calls my name.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Oct 27, 2023~This is the closest starbucks to me, and every time I go, they some how get slower. Like physically no sense of urgency whatsoever, I ordered my drink mobile order 20 minutes prior and a cafe order got theirs first, so I went and politely asked when mine would be finished and I got a bothersome `"I'm finishing it now`", and then was ignored when I said thank you. They have the worst attitudes and even worse work ethic. I don't know how their store manager can keep on some of this morning crew with their awful attitudes. The only thing I enjoyed was the Halloween music playing in the cafe.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Oct 3, 2023~Worst customer service ever. I was ignored for 18 minutes before the girl in the grey sweater, long eyelashes, black hair who was working on 10-3-23 at 11:30am shoved my drink to me because I POLITELY asked if she can make my hot drink cold. She then refused to tell me her name and she told me to shut up and get out.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 24, 2023~Workers are so rude!! Worst location I've ever been to. If you hate your job so much just quit!!! Don't take it out on the customers. Please do better
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Mar 9, 2023~Being a Barista is a craft and unfortunately there is no pride taken in this craft here at this Starbucks location. My order was wrong again, my matcha latte was made with whole milk instead of oatmilk which anyone who works around food or has even eaten any food should understand the severity of this mistake. I will never go to this location again, this is not the first time that this has happened.  The rushed anxiousness of individuals just spoils the whole Starbucks experience for me; which I thank because I am now cured and done with Starbucks all together.
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Oct 14, 2022~I came to this location and the young lady that was taking orders was beyond rude. No nice greeting when I started to order just what can i get you, then is that it when i was finished but i wanted something else. Then when I arrive to the window to do my payment, luckily there was a nice young lady. They're taking payments. But the other girl was still there laying on the counter and looked over and rolled her eyes at me. Completely unprofessional. I won't rate this Starbucks bad because everybody else there is really nice but I've never seen her before and it was a horrible experience.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jun 18, 2020~This Starbucks recently opened and I'm loving the location and the drive thru line has not been crazy. Hubs and I parked and walked in to place our order. There was designated spots on the floor indicating the 6 ft spacing from walking in the door to waiting for your order. Everyone was friendly and the order was quick and correct. This might be my new fave Starbucks to get my fix at!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 14, 2023~I understand they are under stress but when they just respond with an attitude doesn't make your day especially if made to your little brother. Worst customer service Natez taking order responding with an attitude. But the rest was good thank you :)
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Sep 17, 2022~Honestly, I hate Starbucks coffee but there's one on every corner. This review isn't for the coffee I got since currently I'm still waiting for it. This is for the girl that took the order outside. She was the nicest person employee I've ever encountered at any Starbucks. The sun is hot and this girl is outside taking orders in the most Plesant way. Unfortunately I did not catch her name.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 15, 2021~We went to this Starbucks for a coffee pick me up. Saw that the drive thru line was excessively long. We decided to go inside and order. We were not greeted by anyone while going inside. The cashier seemed new, she did not know how to ring up the order in front of us nor our order. No one was helping her as well. The drinks came out fairly quickly but the one food item we got took 8 minutes. When the food was being delivered I could hear the shift lead saying, sorry they put it in the wrong place as a bunch of food came out at once. The hand off person was not attempting to see what everyone was waiting on nor trying to connect.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jun 2, 2023~I was doing an Uber Order after the lobby closed. I called to see if they could bring the order out because the line was about 15 cars back. The man who answered refused to take the 100 feet out and give me the order. Instead they made me wait in the line for 30 minutes when the order was ready when I first pulled in. I would not recommend coming to this Starbucks it is the absolute worst. Every time I've come here the service is terrible and extremely slow compared to other Starbucks!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 26, 2023~There's no need for me to be in line for 20 mins when there was only 2 cars in front of me. Every time I stop by this location they take forever!!! Never again coming here again.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jun 25, 2022~Locked in the drive through for 30 minutes now and no end in sight! They should just close the drive through at this point.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 6, 2023~I was so excited a few years ago when this location opened up because it's right by my house. I know that COVID did damage to businesses, but what has happened to this location is way beyond that. The last time I ordered an iced caramel latte and an iced vanilla latte and the girl kept asking which on I wanted with no ice! I've ordered on the app and the wrong drinks were made, I have gone several times and it's just been closed. Starbucks used to have a very high standard and it showed in how they trained ALL of their employees. The people at this store seem to have very little training and would benefit from being on an episode of Undercover Boss. I won't go back, and that sucks because I am blind and can walk to that location. So unfortunate.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 23, 2022~Went in on my way to a meeting. Ordered a pumpkin cream cold brew. Waited 15 minutes and still didn't have my drink. I finally asked about it and they said it would be another 10 minutes. When I asked why it was going to take 25 minutes for a cold brew I was told it was because they were busy. Then another employee stated they ran out of cold brew. No communication. I guess they were just going to make me stand there all day - no care about anyone having to get to work or on with their day. Horrible customer service.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 19, 2022~If I could give no stars , I would , line is always super long but it's the closest one , I've gave it a chance many time an only gets worse , when I order a venti I get a grande at the window an they get upset cause I correct them at the window , so this time they did the same to my daughter and she told them it was a venti an what they did was just put more ice in a venti cup an pour the grande in there an were rude about it when she asked for a venti ugh
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Nov 8, 2022~Don't go to this Starbucks unless you bring a cushion to sit on. The seats are UNGODLY uncomfortable!! And there's only one electrical outlet in the whole place. The baristas are super nice, though.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Mar 7, 2023~I can always taste the difference when the baristas here allow the espresso shots to go bad. If you have white mocha sauce at the bottom of a cup go ahead and swirl the cup around and mix the shot in before it goes bad. Not hard to do.
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Nov 23, 2021~I just wish the baristas would actually mix the espresso shots with the white mocha. I get a triple shot espresso over ice with 3 pumps white mocha. When I was a barista I would mix the hot espresso shots immediately with the thick sauces like mocha or white mocha. This helps to keep the shots sweet. I hate seeing a layer of white mocha at the bottom of my cup when I get it. It doesn't taste as good when you let the shots sit there without mixing it into the white mocha.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Nov 26, 2022~If I could I would rate this experience I would rate it a negative one and here is why . I went there around 10:30-10:40pm tonight and I ordered 1 large hot chocolate and a ribbon crunch coffee with two BIRTHDAY cake pops . The coffee didn't even taste like ribbon crunch.The cake pops are not even birthday they gave me vanilla so at this point I'm very unhappy and I should of said something but I was in a rush . Also I did not get the correct straws for my drinks either because both straws do not even pop out of the cup when I placed it in . Anyway I'm very displeased and hope you guys can do better with your employees next time . I hate poor customer service.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Feb 16, 2023~Even with them being busy, I've gotten my order pretty fast. Walked in with no line and the drive thru was packed. Informed them when placing order to take their time and I wasn't really in a rush, but not even ten minutes later from placing, the order was ready for me. While this location is next to a college, the morning line in the store isn't quite bad as the drive thru. Keep up the hard work!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jan 22, 2023~No matter how good the drinks are, they always take forever to get your drink. I have had to wait over 15 minutes after the estimated time for finishing my drinks every time and it's not ok. They don't even really care. One of they guys will stop making drinks to go in his phone when they are busy. Not recommend. Go to a different starbucks or dutch bros.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Feb 27, 2020~5- Stars! I love this new Starbucks! Everything is so shiny and new; best of all, the drinks are perfect and the service is very friendly. I feel like family when I walk in and look forward to coming back for many years ahead. Welcome to the neighborhood
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jun 11, 2021~I know Starbucks is always busy but I'm reminded why I never come to this location. Easily spend over 20 minutes. The line here never moves quickly.Update. After waiting over 20 minutes to even order (I would have left but I was trapped in) my iced coffee didn't even have a single ice cube in it
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 23, 2022~This location closed its cafe for no apparent reason. I believe it's because the community college nearby started classes and they don't want a lot of college kids inside their location. I am appalled that this location cares that little for the community they serve.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jul 7, 2022~If you value your time Do not go to this location. Poorly run and always super long wait times. (30min+) They even keep their mobile orders on when the lobby is closed so you still have to wait in the forsaken drive-thru line.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jun 3, 2023~The customer service I recently got was horrid. This girl Dora was very rude. I was in the drive thru for some time when I decided to just pull into a parking space and go inside. Inside the store, things seem to be chaotic and there seemed to be no clear communication between the staff at this location. I was at the counter waiting to order as this young girl, whose name tag said `"Dora`", was working the drive thru window. There were there two other baristas making drinks and after 8 minutes of waiting, I asked if any of them can help me when they got a chance and the girl at the drive thru window, `"Dora`", stated to me that I `"should just wait patiently`". I began to explain that I already was waiting for awhile in the drive thru line and have to make it work and she stated that I `"should have gotten up earlier, and then she mumbled `"lazy ass`" and then opened the window to serve drinks to a customer. I was in shock and I left the store and didn't place my order. I am so appalled that a Starbucks employee, would talk to a customer like that. All I asked if I can get some help. I have been going to this location for some time now and have never been so mistreated. I will be going to the Better Business Bureau with my claim.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Mar 28, 2021~Soooo slow. They are pretty disorganized. Waited 20 minutes for a banana bread loaf in a small room filling quickly with people waiting for mobile orders and walk-in orders during the pandemic. Driving past this one next time.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Oct 17, 2022~they didn't give me a free bday Drink bc I don't have the app, ridiculous! Like it's still my bday even if I don't have the app lmao tf. I even offered to show my id. Service sucks here
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~May 2, 2021~Like every other Starbucks yes they get very busy! but I love my coffee I always ask for americano extra hot and the afternoon/night staff are always super nice and accurate, yes sometimes you have to wait but you don't see the staff doing nothing like they are busy cuz they have a bunch of orders and they are 10/10 doing their best
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 4, 2022~They didn't have any drizzles and had bad customer service, they took so long just to come up to the cash register
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jan 16, 2022~This place has gone down hill the kids running it are super lazy &amp; immature. It was near closing only a few cars left and the put the cones across the drive thru when they could've did our order, just plain laziness especially giving attitude. We waited so long and they do that. Not to mention earlier we went and the drive thru worker was rushing my order trying to make me be quiet. I give this starbucks 0 stars. Starbucks is a company that is represented by hard workers with great attitudes not lazy people with grumpy attitudes,  this location had the worst customer service ever.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Mar 14, 2022~This Starbucks location is entirely too slow. I have been in the drive thru line for over 30 min and I'm still two cars away from the window.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Oct 30, 2022~I placed a mobile order and it took nearly 30 min after it said it would be ready. It was 2 very simple drinks and 2 treats. I saw multiple cars go and leave through the drive through. Worst service. Never coming here again. I feel like I wasted so much time.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jan 9, 2021~Ridiculous. The whole state of Arizona is open but I can't go in and buy a coffee? The only reason I came here was because it was closer than Dutch Brothers. I will gladly drive the extra mileage to get better coffee.  For anyone reading this message, if you haven't tried Dutch Brothers, you really need to. A much better quality of coffee.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jul 5, 2022~Yet again a 5 am visit with no cold brew available.  They assured me that they would follow-up with the night crew when I expressed this being a frequent problem.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jun 28, 2022~This location is on my route to work.  Inevitably they are the slowest at opening.  They are filled with excuses and are so ill prepared for opening hours.  There is never a sense of urgency or consideration for those waiting unnecessarily long wait times.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Dec 26, 2020~Rude.. there was 10 minutes until close and they put cones in the drive thru. My bf asked if they were closed and the person was like nope but we will be by the time its your turn and we waited to see and they cleared the line before close... he didn't even apologize or anything and we were the last car and we were next.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jun 20, 2022~If you'd like to wait 20 minutes in the drive thru line when there's two cars there total and receive lukewarm below average coffee this is the place to go. When we asked for a new hot coffee instead of one that was just sitting there while we were waiting for the line, the drive thru cashier was upset with us for it. Below average in every aspect especially customer service. Will never be coming back to location.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 3, 2022~This is the worst starbucks in Glendale, and there are 3 a mile away. The 67th Peoria and 59th Olive,are always short staffed. The employees complain and have attitude. They dont care about making the drinks right. The drive thrus are always packed in an excessive wait. You are better off placing an online order on 59th thunderbird. They are very consistent.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 17, 2022~I had ordered 2 drinks at 5:40 and the app said it would be ready by 5:54. I walk in. Super dead super slow. The baristas are just talking, not making drinks. 10 mins in and they ask what i was there for, i pointed at the hanging tickets and they laughed and took an extra 15 mins to make the drinks. Just fo to the horendous drive thru cuz these people dont care: they need to fire everyone and hire a whole new staff, with better customer service and working skills
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Mar 26, 2022~This place is always ran by women who are very rude, inconsiderate, and inconsistent. Yeah rhey look like they are working hard, but they don't give grest progress. The drinks are always made out of order. You order 3 and get 1 wait for like 20-30 mins for the other 2. Like who trained them?
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~May 29, 2022~Would be 5 stars but they are no longer open 24/7 I guess smh  but I come here late night bc I work overnights &amp; they are all super nice especially the girl w/ red or pink hair! Can u guys pls go back to being open 24/7 for the ones who work overnights
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Apr 16, 2022~Placed an online order and they won't even let me pick it up. I now have to sit in the drive through line that goes around the block because I already paid. It's supposed to be 24 hours but they rarely are actually open. This place is ran by immature rude kids. Every time I come here they either mess up my order or are straight up not even taking orders or the doors are locked. Last time I go anywhere but my regular Starbucks
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Mar 12, 2020~To be honest I don't even want to give one star very poor customer service was in last week for happy hour ordered two caramel macchiato's it was charged full price for all of them even though I paid with my app the girl running the register her name is Ariana said that because I didn't say it was happy hour I don't get it half off I explained that it doesn't state that on the app or in the emails that I'm supposed to say it I assumed because I was paying with my app I was covered I generally go to Starbucks about four times or more a week I will no longer especially this location very bad customer service
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~May 29, 2021~I usually always go to that Starbucks and don't have any problems but tonight i went they gave me my drink once i got to the window which was great but my drink looked very old as if it has been sitting there for a while and tasted bad as well which I didn't end up drinking the top of the lid of my drink was also scribbled with pen which made me think it was a random lid they got from anywhere. bummed out because i bought a drink i didn't end up drinking so i wasted my money please don't give out old drinks We pay $5  + and we expect to get for what we paid.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Mar 24, 2020~I love this Starbucks, everything is new and clean. The employees are really nice I love it. They make the best chai latte and coffee.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Mar 7, 2021~This Starbucks is awful. Terrible service. Took forever and they got our order wrong. Will not return.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Mar 22, 2021~I went inside because the drive thur was to long it took them 10-15 mins for my drink ONE drink they focus only on the drive thur not the people inside so by the time I got my drink and went outside the drive thur line was gone ‍ focus on all your guest oh I also got a ham and cheese croissant they gave it to me right away but by the time I got my drink it was cold it was just a horrible Experience never going back to this location
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Dec 17, 2020~Horrible experience ever! I ve never had bad experience at any starbucks and never seen such rude waitstaffs. Thank God I never live nor work around here so I dont have to visit them anymore.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~May 19, 2021~Keirsten is my favorite employee there. She always gives me the best quality of food and drink. Everyone greets me excitedly when I walk in. Could do without the weeds though.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Mar 7, 2021~Bad customer service!! they pay no attention to customers and such a long wait for mobile order
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Nov 17, 2020~This place has the best coffee ever.The staff was nice they get your drinks correct, and really patient.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Mar 12, 2020~Leah is such a nice barista and I liked your guys service very fast and the Carmel trap with dulce was very good I loved it one fr again thank you sooo much
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Oct 19, 2024~Well Sports Fans,Once again I am at my Favorite Place , Starbuck's ! Why you inquire because I love their Coffee and the Ambiance and their impeccable service. Does not matter if I am at aTarget Store; like I am now or a Corporate Store on 40th &amp; E. Thunderbird ( affectionately referred toAs My HQ). Fortunately they don't chargeme rent? My Coffee requires 1Splenda  and enough cold Almond Milk so I can enjoy my coffee as soon as it's prepared.99.99999% of the Barista's deliver my order with a Smile. WOW, I love Starbucks .What went well was Just Another SBMoment
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Dec 12, 2024~Ordered two specialty lattes via the drive thru. Upon being handed the cups, they felt light so I checked them once I got back home, only to find they were both around half full. At $7 per drink the bare minimum you can do is fill the damn cup up.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Nov 6, 2024~I used to love this Starbucks. It was my favorite. And then it went downhill. The customer service just isn't the same. The lady has forgotten to give me my change twice. She just says I assumed you wanted to leave a tip... miss mam I already left a tip give me my change ...  they just do not properly mix drinks anymore. The floors are always gross and sticky and I just idk the grilled cheese sandwiches are good so I'll give them that. I miss who ever used to run the joint. What happened to Greg. He was the best
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Jan 24, 2018~I want to take a star off for the lack of cleanliness but the customer service and freshness of your coffee won't allow me. Your employees are kind, especially to the elderly. Yeah, I watch out for that when I come here. Your shift manager is nice as well. She had a disgruntled customer and what made her stand out to me was how she handled him. She didn't call him a liar. She listened, apologized then corrected the errors made. That's excellent customer service!  My venti iced caramel flavor and drizzled coffee was delicious! The bagels are always fresh and soft  taste great with butter btw.  I'll be back tomorrow.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Dec 4, 2024~For there to be five people working, this is the absolute slowest Starbucks that I've visited. I travel across the nation. The women working on December 4th 2024 were clueless
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~May 13, 2024~They showed they were open and no one came to do anything .  I came before closing and they acted as if they were closed.  Very poor service didn't even let me know.Zero star
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Mar 1, 2024~The customer service is slow.  Additionally, it is always busy and difficult to get into.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~4~Jan 14, 2023~This location is close to me. The drive through is near desert ridge so a very convenient location. I have never had any issues with my drinks and the staff is amicable. I love that they are so dog friendly!! The only con is it is located in a narrow corner so when it gets packed you end up stuck there.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Sep 12, 2021~Came from New York and decided to order from this location. I understand that I'd have to speak slower and break down my drink but honestly if I tell you light ice, pls give me light ice, if you put powdered matcha in my drink pls don't leave it in the bottom sitting and not shake it. Who's training this location? Do better
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Dec 13, 2021~This is a convenient location for waiting for patients from thee nearby surgical center. It's not large, but plenty of seating. Very nice decor, large restrooms, very nice staff.  And of course, good coffee and scones.  I enjoyed watching the staff greet the regulars enthusiastically by name. Nice.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Dec 10, 2020~I have to say, why,  other than convenience and my stupidity ,  why do I continue to come to this location!   This is how I received my drink order.Ugh!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~4~Feb 5, 2023~They get the job done. Very much your average Starbucks. Drive thru was crazy which is why I think the in-house people where slow.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Jan 20, 2023~I have never felt compelled to review a Starbucks before but I just visited this store this morning and had the roughest morning leaving the house. And the gentleman who took my order and greeted me at the window COMPLETELY shifted my mood. He was so bubbly even though I was not and I just want him to know that he made my morning better by being so kind and excited to see me. Thank you!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Jul 13, 2020~12 years since I first reviewed this Starbucks location. Just amazing. I've never lived in one place that long, but time flies.Other than being cramped in many ways this is a great location to get your caffeine fix. Whether it's a latte, frappuccino or iced tea they always get the order right, at least for me. By cramped, I mean I don't understand how everything in Arizona is packed in tighter than sardines. The parking lot is made for maybe 20 cars, but there are that many businesses. Pre-COVID the seating area was always packed making it impossible to find a place to sit. Now for the good stuff. The baristas are friendly and make you feel valued as a customer. The only thing I ask is that you don't line up out on Tatum for the drive-thru. Please just take a minute to go inside, Heck, you probably need the steps anyway.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Sep 23, 2008~Hey, it's coffee and that's all I get, a good ole cup of joe...Black. The service is great and this location is always packed. It's near my cleaners and my bank making it even better.Five stars for great service.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Mar 1, 2022~Mhmm.. this location has kinda bugged me it's right by my work so very convient but literally it's open every other day or every other week....I don't know why but super inconvient when it's the closest one to my job and the next one is at least 10 mins away ...Is there a particular reason some days are open and others are not ??!!Would help out a lot and I'm sure other customers
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jun 16, 2022~Come here and do the drive thru, but of course they don't have what I want. The staff is indifferent and could care less. I won't be back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Oct 11, 2019~Oh my goodness Starbucks! Help me understand what you are doing. The redesign of the interior is HORRIBLE. Very cold feeling and teeny tiny tables with hard tile floor and chairs that make a screeching noise every time they are moved. People are shuffling around to try and get a spot at a little table and it just gets obnoxiously loud. It was very difficult to have a conversation and enjoy the coffee with the atrocious acoustics. There are two tables outside but they are right beside the drive through which is always backed up. I won't be back to have coffee inside and judging by the reviews on this yelp page, the drive through is pretty disastrous too. Change it back!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Oct 8, 2022~They are slow as f@ck here! I gave two stars only because at least the drink was made well, but by the time I got up to the window it was almost completely melted. I thought about telling them to remake it, but I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for a Frappuccino. Definitely would not come back to this location!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Apr 14, 2019~I used to love #Starbucks. Used to be focused on good #coffee and great customer service but they've turned into a oversized Corp company that doesn't care about quality. I swear something always is messed up at this location. Today half my fams #caramel #macchiatos were spilling everywhere and caramel was all over the dang cup. I used to work at Starbucks, the recipes aren't hard. Pay attention to the lines and quit overfilling the cup. The only reason why I continue to go to Starbucks is because they're on every block compared to independent coffee shops. Starbucks needs to quit raising their prices for sub par coffee n customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Dec 1, 2018~Love this Starbucks cause there's a drive thru. But when you get to the window it feels like your really far. Also it's in the corner which there's not much room. My order was wrong and specifically told them what I want but at least they fixed it. Usually they do a good job.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Apr 2, 2022~Super friendly &amp; super fast - my favorite Starbucks location to go to! Customer service at this location is on point!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~4~Dec 19, 2019~Not a fan of the entrance/exit and seating area. It's a very small location, maybe about 10 tables. I never used the drive thru so not sure if they provide fast service through there. But inside, we are greeted with a smile and have our drinks ready in a timely manner.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~4~Jun 9, 2019~This particular Starbucks is one of the smaller locations.  The staff is friendly and atmosphere casual.  It's different to find parking since it shares a parking lot with other busy stores.  There are only 3 tables for outside seating.  The drive thru line is usually backed up into the parking lot.  It's my least favorite location for all the reasons I mentioned.  Overall it's a convenient location, just not ideal.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Dec 9, 2022~I tried this location out of convince on my way home.  Never again! Tasted absolutely terrible. Ordered two drinks for $13 that went in the garbage.  TERRIBLE
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Dec 2, 2021~Employees were extremely rude. I went Thanksgiving night and was rushed into placing my order. The employee (had a blonde bob) then forgot to give me a straw and when I went back through the drive through, she told me to go across the street to the gas station. Inexcusable. I will be going to corporate and not returning to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Apr 10, 2021~Hey Starbucks on Tatum! Can we give more training to the team members taking orders outside? There is always a huge line of cars outside &amp; close to the road which is dangerous and causing traffic. Your employees need to utilize the space that's open between car to car &amp; ask them to move up! Just a thought. Thanks!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Aug 25, 2021~Worst mobile oder  Location I have ever been to I waited  15 minutes past my pick up time and watched people walk in place order and get their drink before me pretty ridiculous
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Nov 8, 2018~I never do this review stuff but I was in a couple weeks ago and had very pleasant experience and thought I should write about it. My latte was great but my service at the register was even better. In particular, one very sweet lady. I can't remember her name but she had short hair and was an older lady, I believe her name started with J?? She helped me out so much with picking something that I would like, I was trying to do something different than regular coffee. She recommended my new favorite drink. Her service made me LOVE Starbucks and this location. This location is a bit out of my way but I'm going to start making the effort to come in and get this great coffe and see this amazing sweet lady. Thank you for the great experience!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Mar 23, 2019~If you are in a hurry do not go to this location! On multiple occasions, I have been in the drive through line with 2 cars in front of me, and it takes 15 minutes to get my order. The associates at this location do not know what customer services means and can't recognize regular customers. Despite service issues, my drink order is always correct.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Jul 24, 2020~I've worked at Starbucks for 6 years previously and I have to say I love this store! They're consistently quick and friendly. Can't ask for a better store to visit in the morning before work.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jul 1, 2022~So i always go to this starbucks because it was near my work. Baristas were friendly and in the beginning of me going here it was fine. As time is passing by my items were just not going well. I would uber eats a drink for a co worker and i and when we got out drinks it was missing things like caramel drizzle and things like that and i was like oh well its fine i used to work at dunkin so i get they make mistakes. Second thing that happened (multiple times) is when i would scan my gift card thingy on the app with money in it so i can get double the points, they used my points and left the money. Okay i didnt rlly understand how they mistakenly used my points instead of the money !multiple times! even when i say `"hey pls use the money`". Was kind of getting agitated by this starbucks. The most recent one is when i used uber eats and they didnt put the lid and the sticker on properly. The uber driver said the lid was not put on properly and a lil less than a half was spilled. When i got the drink out the bag the lid wasnt on. The bag was dripping and i could barely taste any esspresso in the drink. It was just milk, white Mocha, and caramel drizzle. I wish they would pay more attention to what theyre doing rather than just put it in and go without paying too much attention to the drinks that they make.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Mar 22, 2018~Every have one of these mornings when you need a second breakfast?  Yup, Happened to me recently.  Had an early start at work, so I stopped and ate with Jack (the one in a box) at 6 am and my tapeworm was screaming feed me at 9:30. It was also crying for some coffee and since I had recently received a nice gift card to Starbucks, I pointed the Truckia (my Kia Soul) to the nearest Starbucks.Now despite conventional wisdom that there is a Starbucks on every corner in America-I'm going top smash that connotation right here and now. This Starbucks across from Desert  Ridge is the only Starbucks within 100 miles of another coffee shop, let alone another Starbucks.  It has to be based on the line of cars in the drive through at 9:30 am and the number of caffeine-deprived coffee seekers and computer toting intellectuals inside. Mixed it up this morning and went with a Blonde (they're more fun) cappuccino.  Had a ton of foam on it (there's a visual).  Excellent cup of coffee!  Like I said, I was hungry and Starbucks, if you can resist the valley of sugar in the display case has a good selection of breakfast sandwiches.  I had the biscuit with sausage, bacon, egg.  It was terrific!  It held me over until Timmy the Tapeworm started crying again around 1 PM.  This really is a smoking busy Starbucks but the service and attitude of the employees was chill and welcoming.  Food and drink was as expected.  Would love to see another one, even next door but that's above my pay grade.  Go grab a blonde and a biscuit, they're perfect for a mid-morning snack.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Jan 21, 2019~This Starbucks is a hit or miss. The drive through can be terrible. I have waited 10-20 mins in the drive through with only 3 cars in front of me before. Also the barista that hands you the drinks don't lean out to hand you your item. I always have to reach out pretty far and I'm a pretty petite girl. I've tried driving closer to the curb but end up scratching my rims. If you are the 3rd person in line, expect it to be a minimum 10 - 15 min wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Dec 5, 2018~I have one word to describe this location, slow!!! Beyond slow.  The drive through is a mess and the scanners for the app hardly work.  I've waited over 30 minutes for a drink and finally had to leave with no drink or refund.  There are people waiting everywhere and there is no room to move.  This location is ALWAYS slow.  Hire more people.  There is no excuse, this has been going on for years at this location.  If you are totally backed up you in the store, take more time for mobile orders, stop taking counter orders and have that person work the bar.  Call in more staff, make solutions not excuses like the barista was doing.  Also a refund would be nice since I never got my drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Nov 25, 2020~10 min wait in drive through without moving, went in. Oh well, he said, it's always like that, don't know what to tell you. As usual, stellar customer service
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Apr 29, 2022~Very delicious love it the tea is amazing boba so sweet can't get enough. very nice people and nice store. defiantly would recommended and come back
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Feb 11, 2019~I live right next to this Starbucks so I visit it pretty frequently. However, last night, I went through the drive thru at around 7:30 PM. No one was in line except me, and I got my order taken very promptly. One thing that bothers me about Starbucks is that the baristas never take 3 seconds to repeat your order to make sure they have it right. So when I ordered my iced drink, I pulled up to the window and waited about 5 min before the barista came and told me their machine broke so it would be out soon. I waited patiently and I understand that things happen.A few min later, my drink was out and it was hot.So I told her I ordered iced, and she went to remake it. A few min later, she came back with the right drink, but the wrong size. So I told her I paid for the bigger size and she went to remake it. I was in the drive thru for about 15 minutes for one drink. And I was the only one in line.I understand a machine broke, but remaking my drink more than once is a little too much waiting in my opinion. Repeating my order the first time around would've had my drink made right the first time.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Apr 20, 2021~The staff at this location are always super friendly and give fast service. I recently started using the mobile ordering app. Since I have been using the app my drinks have been shorted.. haven't taken a sip from this....
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Sep 1, 2020~Well Starbucks is Starbucks : you like it or not.  I like their breakfast sandwiches and the coffee is ok (I always thought it tasted a bit `"burned`", for lack of better word).  This location can get busy in the morning as there are not a lot of coffee shops around that area, including other Starbucks).  Sometimes it feels they could improve efficiency though.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~May 5, 2015~Stopped in briefly for a quick coffee. Efficient service. Strong coffee. Nothing really different than other locations.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Apr 1, 2019~I do not recommend at all to come to this Starbucks. Their drink is horrible and when you ask to remake the drink they give so much attitude back. The interior is nice but the customer service is horrible and make tasteless drinks. Also it's pretty clean but again if you want a good Starbucks drink it is not good at all.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jun 30, 2019~I used to love Starbucks, and visit this one almost every morning on my way to work. However, with a recent health concern I've had to go gluten free, which has been hard at times, but when establishments offer a gluten free allergen list online (as starbucks does) I feel excited to see what I can still have :) Unfortunately, as I walked into this Starbucks I was saddened with the fact that apparently NOTHING is gluten free. I asked the kind lady at the register if she was sure and she said her supervisor was certain, and I asked her if she could ask again, possibly if I could have a tea. Again, she came back saying he said nothing to his knowledge is gluten free. I'm not sure if this is true for every Starbucks or due to the lack of knowledge from the supervisor. Leaving starbucks feeling taken off guard, and SO happy I didn't go through the long drive-thru just to be turned away.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Nov 25, 2013~This was our first time to this particular location and as the other reviews state - it was slammed both inside and in the drive-thru.  Took about ten minutes to get through the line, with about six people in front of me and about eight workers behind the counter. They also don't seem to have any storage in their back room, since they had well over 20 merchandise boxes sitting around the the store and unopened.  They also had a large pastry metal cart with single wrapped pastries sitting on them.  The poor staff looked highly stressed and the cashier wasn't overly friendly, but wasn't rude or mean either. My drink order was correct and tasted just like it should though, and let's be honest - at the end of the day, isn't that all that you really want from your coffee?Overall: BIt's a busy location with staff under pressure to get through lines and lots of seasonal merchandise to put on display. It wasn't an exceptional experience, but it wasn't bad either!  Still the good coffee I was expecting to get - so all is right in the world.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Jun 23, 2019~Service is usually great but lately your staff has been closing early. It's 8:36pm Saturday and you're supposed to be open until 9pm or later correct?, but instead they're just turning people away at the drive thru saying `"sorry we are closed`"
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Oct 27, 2019~Gets 3 stars for what Starbucks formula usually does right, but whoever was responsible for the interior redesign should be fired! From the usual cozy homey feel for coffee houses to cold plain and just plain anti cozy. Terrible. I refuse to dine inside anymore.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Nov 8, 2018~This location is my neighborhood Starbucks, and I go in often. I have never had a problem with anyone being rude, and in fact, there is an employee, Joan, who is terrific and takes a genuine interest in her customers, especially repeat customers. She is always kind and quick to take my order, and I look forward to seeing her!I really appreciate that the morning Starbucks employees get up in the middle of the night, to arrive at their job and make sure I have a great coffee drink. Let's show some kindness and appreciation to the people who serve us every day, whether that's at Starbucks, a restaurant, or the dry cleaners. Everyone deserves kindness and respect.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Jun 11, 2018~I never thought I would write a review for a Starbucks... but here I am. I go to Starbucks for convenience and this location is consistent every single time. Last time we were there, even my fiance said, `"this starbucks is on it.`" I've never had bad customer service here, and the drive thru moves quickly. Last week I ordered my usual, and as the guy handed it to me I thought it didn't look right. Before I even had to say anything, he commented on it having too much milk and said, `"let me remake this.`" Additionally, we went yesterday and a girl covering drive thru noticed that our dog was in the back seat and offered to make her a pupaccino (sp?). Keep up the great work!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Feb 19, 2016~I stop at this Starbucks almost weekly because it's the most convenient location on my way to work. Even when the lines are long, I still usually get through fairly quickly. However, this morning and several other times in the past, I will get my coffee and notice the cup feels lighter than it should. So when I got to work, I pulled the lid off and the cup was barely half full. I'm usually in a hurry going through the drive so I don't have time to address it as it happens, but seriously, this coffee is to expensive for them to only be filling the cups up half way.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Jan 21, 2017~Great friendly customer service! However, overall restroom facility cleanliness is less than par. My impression is that there isn't a focus on mopping the floors, or frequent checks on housekeeping. Just an FYI.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Mar 8, 2016~Busy and slow.  Every time I come here it's pretty packed and it seems like it takes forever to get my order.  On top of that it's the always-questionable Starbucks quality/flavor that's a 3-star on their best day.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Jun 11, 2018~I like get coffee at Starbucks but the service is fantastic always friendly as well, must listen how I selling my name on the coffee or a treat
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Nov 12, 2015~Come here every morning and have never had a bad experience. Awesome baristas that have been there for a while and are anyways in a good mood. Great way to start the day!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Sep 23, 2018~What a disaster! Save yourself the headache and go across the street to the one in Albertsons. First off, the gal at the register overcharged me $1.50 for drip coffee (apparently cream is extra to her). When I finally got my order it was all wrong; wrong size, wrong flavor. I said something and they literally poured it into a bigger cup and topped with coffee. Said something again and got a lot of attitude, but when you charge me almost $5 for a drip coffee, I want it right. She tried to tell me me that was what I ordered. Umm. No. After 20 minutes I finally walked out with my $5 drip coffee. Save yourself and go somewhere else, anywhere else!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Jul 10, 2017~I decided to review because this location recently went under renovations and I am completely impressed. It is a very busy shop and it used to be very dark and cramped along with the crazy traffic situation in the drive thru. However, the recent renovations have utilized the space and created a bright inviting environment with a new mobile pickup area, which is great because I no longer have to wait for a barista to grab my drink from behind the counter. The staff has always been very good at getting their mobile orders out and I almost never have a wait time when I walk into the shop. My best experience was a mobile order with 5 drinks drove from work which is about 5mins away and by the time I got there all of the drinks were ready and waiting in a drink carrier for me.If in a hurry I definitely suggest mobile ordering from this store, they are extremely consistent on getting mobile orders out quickly.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Oct 22, 2018~Was helped by an older lady named Joan today. She looked back to see me at the register and looked at me like I was bothering her. I politely asked for my drink and she was still being short(rude). I then just quietly grabbed my drink and turned around to hear her snap `"YOU'RE WELCOME`"! Obviously this has put me in a horrible mood to start out my week. I would not recommend keeping Joan as an employee if that is how she is going to treat people in the mornings.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jan 27, 2021~I love Starbucks, I've been going for years and this location is just awful. I've had issues almost every time I've gone here whether it be them messing up my drink or charging my card an extra $22 for no reason. Today I ordered a venti caramel latte, a very simple drink and they literally gave me a cup of hot milk with no flavor, coffee, or even sugar. I get it, accidents happen especially when you're busy but how does something like that even happen? Save your time and money and go to the one on Tatum and Bell they do a much better job.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Jul 6, 2017~Recently renovated, very clean, and many places to sit inside. Very friendly, one lady took the initiative and patience to hear what I was looking for and offered suggestions. Followed by explaining if i didn't like it, they'd remake it. I'll be coming back!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Aug 2, 2015~Longest wait times!! 15 minutes in the drive thru is not ok!The baristas here seem to be less than thrilled to service their customers. Obviously those who frequent Starbucks will continue to do so, this particular location is just a bad representation.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Sep 8, 2020~I go through this drive through a lot since I've been working from home and the customer service is always great. HOWEVER! For some reason this locations coffee tastes AWEFUL. I get a venti vanilla cold brew with sweet cream and it is always watered down and bitter, even with the sweet cream in it. The location on cave creek and carefree makes the same exact drink for me and it tastes a hundred times better, like the best coffee ever. I've tried different flavors/ combinations but this locations coffee is always disgusting. Idk why, might be worth going to the one inside desert ridge instead
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Mar 18, 2011~Meh, I've experienced much better...We used to frequent this Star Bucks a lot until Press Coffee opened near by.  We wanted to top off a great evening with a nice cup of Joe and Press Coffee was closed at 7pm and it was 7:30pm, oh no.... so we stopped by Star Bucks.The service started off as a standard Star Bucks, quick to greet, though missing the smile this time, and ready to make what ever caffeinated concoction your craving for.Coffee #1 `~ decaf and sugar free vanilla syrup. Barista stated, `"we are out to decaf, would regular coffee be ok?`" What??  No, we would like a decaf please.  Barista, `"that will take 10 mins, so you will need to wait`".  We asked, why are you out of decaf? Barista, `"we stop making decaf earlier in the day`". We did not want to wait so we opted for a leaded brew.Coffee #2 `~ regular coffee with sugar free caramel.  I watched the Barista and noticed she used the white pump for the sugar free vanilla and the brown pump for the sugar free caramel. Star Bucks used one collar for sugar free and the other for sugared syrups.  As she poured our coffee I asked her to please make sure she gave us sugar free and not sugar. I noticed you used both colored pumps.  Barista, snippy `~ `"we don't separate our flavorings like the other Star Bucks`". She then dumped our coffee's out and using the same cups proceeded to use the same pumps again...  So we got both coffee's and proceeded to the cream bar and there was no cream...  So I asked a different barista for some cream.  She stated, `"here ya go`" and placed a gallon carton of cream on the bar and walked off.Wowsers!  The coffee tasted burned as though it had been sitting there a while and we were for sure if we were drinking sugar free.  No sugar comma later so we are ok and don't plan to go back to this Star Bucks for a while...
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~May 20, 2020~Will never come back here again.. i get it's a crazy time with covid 19 and everything but at least be more kind. I went through drive thru and the girl at the drive through (glasses and dale hair) made me drop me change and then stared at me and she never spoke to me once. If you are that worried about covid then don't work and stay home! I've never been more irritated ever. Handle your employees and be curtious it's a very sensitive time
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Aug 23, 2020~I should have taken a photo, for accountability reasons. I didn't, I was in a rush to get to work, and I'm sure it can be pulled up on security cameras. Needless to say I got a tall mocha frap two extra shots with whip. I was feeling like I deserved a little treat. As drinking it the straw got clogged and as I sucked I thought it was a piece of chocolate then soon spitting it out realized it was a piece of plastic. Not a small piece. Thank god I didn't swallow it, thank god I wasn't a child. I drove back and walked in to show what I had found. The lady behind the counter said `"oh it's a piece from our whip cream`" and offered to remake it OR give me a refund. Idk, wish it was handled with a little more empathy or reaction. Maybe this happens all the time.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Mar 29, 2009~this is a great starbucks.I drive through at least 3 times a week always get great service.also a great place to sit and do homework, great people, great coffee :)near desert ridge!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Oct 30, 2013~Very busy location, even the drive thru always has a line!  This Starbucks is probably not the best location to go to if you are in a big hurry.  Its hard to find a close parking spot.  Its also more difficult to get in and out of this particular stripmall because Tatum is usually packed.  Go to the light if you need to turn left!The baristas have always been pleasant to deal with here.  One even took the time to look up the ingredients a a smoothie for me, so very accommodating.  I will say their bathrooms at this one seem to always appear dirty, yuck!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Aug 7, 2019~This is the worst place slow as heck!!!! Drive thru are surposed to be quick and efficient !!!!!! What a damn joke the guy with the glasses was rude unprofessional lucky my homey was not with me after his crazy comment his glasses could of been in his knuckle headed brain because there could of been a wack !!!!! Better go to school of hard knocks lol
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~May 14, 2012~Just a suggestion, but smile people! Really, it makes the customer service experience better and not make people feel like spawn coming in for coffee.Not sure if it was an off day here with the staff but talk about a unhappy group of people! My coffee otherwise rocked! Perfectly hot just how I like it!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jun 11, 2016~This Starbucks consistently has employees working the drive through that behave as if they are doing you some sort of a favor by taking your order and making your drink.  Allison was incredibly cold and exemplified poor customer service.  Starbucks, you guys are dropping the ball at this location.  P.S. Baristas-if you want to make more tips, try giving people customer service instead of attitude.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Jul 24, 2012~It's a Starbucks: they burn the coffee beans and use really artificial flavors but I'm addicted and so are you so we all grumble and pretend to be coffee aficionados while take the mediocre drinks on our daily commutes.They never mess up my drink here but the wait is horrendous. Like, expect to wait 10 minutes for your drink when you're the only one in the drive-thru. If there are people in front of you you'd better have a lot of extra time or hope  you don't care if you're late. Another annoyance is the design of the drive-thru window with the curb. It's set like 3 feet back so when you pull up to pay/get your coffee you have to reeaaalllly reach out your window and even then you barely grasp the barista's hand to exchange money and get your beverage(s). I go here everyday because it's the only drive-thru right by my house. But I complain every time I do.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Aug 27, 2017~It just took 30 mins to get an ice tea via a mobile order. They say it's because they're down staff, but this site is always slow.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Jun 29, 2013~THIS STARBUCKS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONE ON TATUM NEAR WALGREENS!I now will park, get out of my car and walk to get my morning coffee. The employees here are so nice and represent that typical Starbucks employee so much better. It is clean and they are quick! They don't mess up my order every other time either.I also like to come here to sit outside and enjoy my coffee, lots of outdoor seating available here.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Jun 28, 2013~I love Starbucks. Huge fan, proud gold cardholder. However, this location fails miserably day in and day out. Not friendly. Inefficient. Slow. Slow inside and slowest Starbucks drive thru. Take me back to 27th &amp; Pine Lake in Lincoln, NE. This store, employees and management, need to do a bit more `"Starbucks culture`" training. Also, 1 out of 3 days something is wrong with my drink. Mistakes happen, I get it. But when they do, don't make me feel like it's my fault. Just correct it. Quickly, especially after waiting 10-20 minutes.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Mar 12, 2017~Worst Starbucks ever. You have to stay in line even if you ordered through the app. The other option is to go front and yell can I pick up my order which has been sat there for 8 minutes now and it is getting cold... someone might hear you and give you your coffee. I'm never coming back here. Have given them enough chance.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Nov 23, 2016~Seriously the worst Starbucks ever... The service sucks they can't get an order right. They have plenty of staff it's just that half of them don't work but stand around and talk... Horrible service
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jul 6, 2017~By far the WORST Starbucks ever! I used to go to this location every day but could not stand it anymore. The staff is beyond rude and never even acknowledge or look at you when ordering. The drive-through is the slowest drive through in history. Cars are backed up through Tatum and again there's no rush there seems to be no hurry. Hate this location
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Jul 24, 2016~Slowest Starbucks we have ever been to. Staff has never been that friendly. It's a convenient location, but it always ends up costing us more time than it's worth. Today, I ran inside to get two drinks because the drive-thru was 6+ cars deep. The inside line was completely empty, meaning I ordered immediately. It still took ten minutes to get my two drinks. This is not the first time this has happened, which is what prompts my review. I am normally a positive reviewer. When I'm paying almost $5 for flavored water (refresher), I have higher standards. We gave it a chance today because I even warned my husband about how slow it was before we drove there. However, I think we're finished with chances. There are plenty of other Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Aug 12, 2017~The people who work here are great but the drive thru line takes 15 minutes. Starbucks needs to open another drive thru north of the 101.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Dec 22, 2016~Had a horrendous experience just now where Mikey the window server refused to give a second order through the drive through; since he couldn't seem to answer me back on his headset after my first order. He immediately called his superior, who then proceeded to tell me merry fucking Christmas after I explained the situation. I will never go to this location again, what a Christmas spirit, what a sense of pride and dignity they offered to their loyal customers. This is not customer service, this is a complete lack of training.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Nov 8, 2018~I am shocked by the review regarding Joan at this Starbucks! There are 3 different Starbucks I pass on the way to work but I stop at this Starbucks as I enjoy seeing Joan.  She always has a smile, is personable and caring!  in the  past two years there seems to be a great deal of staff turn over  but Joan has been there consistently and is such a great asset to this Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Nov 8, 2018~I was quite dismayed to read a review about an employee that has provided outstanding service for the past 6+ years.  I am a daily or even twice daily customer and Joan is always pleasant, friendly, and helpful.  It is management that should have gotten the bad review.  The bathrooms are typically quite disgusting and I have mentioned it several times, to no avail.  It also seems as though they are constantly understaffed, with long wait times for drinks to be made.  Just because one customer had a bad day, doesn't make a good employee bad.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Nov 8, 2018~I have been a loyal customer at this Starbucks for 13 years. I just read a review that included negative comments about Joan an employee at the store. I have always enjoyed seeing her every morning when I arrive. She is courteous, friendly and proactive in anticipating customer needs. She gets my drink going without me having to say a word. I am always greeted warmly and I have witnessed countless other customers who are treated as friends by Joan. Customers also ask about her when she isn't there showing concern for her. She obviously has built relationships that keep people coming back. I can speak from personal experience that Starbucks is lucky to have her and should hire more employees who go above and beyond as she does!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~4~Feb 3, 2007~The map makes it difficult to tell, but this is almost certainly the main Starbucks at the Desert Ridge Mall.  As it happens there is also a Starbucks inside the Albertson's at one end of the mall and there are Starbucks beverages to be found inside the Barnes &amp; Noble, but the proper Starbucks is easily found toward the movie theater end of the place.That said, the place is fine.  It's small and slightly cramped, but if you go to that mall during the day when the crowds are small then it's a decent little spot.  Given that it's located in the food-court-like area of the outdoor mall, the seating possibilities are vast, even though the interior is a bit cramped.The people were always nice, as usual.  A cold Starbucks bev on a hot Phoenix summer day was not a bad way to go.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~4~Aug 17, 2013~Nice Starbucks location in the Desert Ridge Mall it is tiny but they do have La Boulange available.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Jun 11, 2014~ugh if they could get the drink right more than once it would be okayit's like they don't even care - nextoh is your drink wrong sorry - nextwhat you want me to make it right - nextplease wait again while I remake it after all these other drinks - next
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Sep 27, 2019~I used to always go to this Starbucks and lately they haven't been the best. Almost every single time my order is wrong. Today I went through the line ordered, and their espresso machine was down, it happens but they were fixing it no big deal. I ordered a white mocha frap, and it come out white. The girl told me it's always been like that, and I told her no I always order this and this has never happened. So she remade it for me, and it still came out wrong!!! Also I ordered my mom a Venti Vanilla latte with whip cream. She gave me the drink and it was a grande and I told her `"I'm sorry to do this again, but I ordered a venti.`" And when I finally got the drinks they were both still wrong, nothing complicated about the order at all!! She literally rolled her eyes in my face and said whatever. Come to mind you I'm already at the window for about 15 min now. The only drink they actually got right was my daughters because it was box juice. I want my money back, poor customer service and super rude. It's not that hard to make a drink. Never coming back.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~May 31, 2014~Accessibility (Parking / Wait Time)1/1 Star: free mall parking lot. No wait. _____Service (Waiter / Cleanness / Ambiance)0/1 Star: fast food style. _____Taste (0=Not Edible / 1=Edible / 2=Good (average) / 3=Must Try!)2/3 Stars: normal Starbucks. _____Overall Experience3/5 Stars _____Last WordsIt's a Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~May 28, 2017~Seriously the WORST Starbucks I have ever been to. The lady in the drive through was so rude. She couldn't get my phone app to scan (even though I go to Starbucks almost daily and have never had anyone else have issues scanning).  She must have been really pissed about it taking her so long to finally get it to scan because when she handed me my drink, she didn't even lean out of her window. She could tell I was struggling to lean out my car window to reach the drink, yet she just kept her hand in the same spot instead of leaning two inches out of her window. This is not the first time I have experienced horrible customer service from this location. Seriously, don't waste your time and effort coming here.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~4~Oct 26, 2011~Drive-thru is rather quick at 5:30am in the morning and the barista was quite cheery for such an early hour -- completely different experience that the inside for a past few visits.  Just goes to show that a good experienced barista can make all the difference in the world!Will Drive-thru again soon!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Sep 9, 2017~I do not recommend this place because they have a small amount of ingredients and I waited for about 25 minutes for a frap and had to change my order because they did not have the ingredients also had to pay full price !
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Dec 19, 2015~This Starbucks is always too busy and you can never be taken care of in a timely matter. I do not recommend going inside. It's pure chaos and it will only make you angry. I do still go through the drive thru but knowingly that I will wait 20 minutes no matter what time of day (and I usually go around 2:30ish) only because it's on my way to pick up my kids from school after work. And I'm busy in line in my car still finishing up work so then I don't feel it's so much of a waste of time.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Dec 20, 2015~This Starbucks should NOT be in business. I ordered a vanilla latte and they gave me literally 1 inch or less of coffee and the rest of my grande sized cup was filled with foam! I'm assuming it was a cappuccino WHICH I DID NOT ORDER. I was pissed! I didn't even want to try to talk to someone because every time I said excuse me to a barista they ignored me. I got fed up and left this shitty place. This is the 3rd time this specific Starbucks fucked up my order I will NOT return. Horrible coffee. Horrible staff. Horrible fucking service.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Dec 6, 2017~This Starbuck's doesn't have the best parking.  Not Starbuck's fault.  The drive thru backs up onto Tatum. Again, not Starbuck's fault.  What they DO have is friendly and hard working employees.  My personal favorite is Joan.  She always has a warm smile, a kind word and a great attitude.  She makes my morning!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Mar 27, 2017~The most amazing people, the most amazing location.  I couldn't be happier to have a Starbucks like them!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~4~Sep 11, 2010~It's Starbucks.  At this particular location though, if the drive through is busy, just go inside... It'll be quicker, I promise.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Sep 25, 2016~Very slow!! Mobile order and took 10 mins to get with an estimated 3 mins. Then order wrong 2x. I have never had problems with any location before. Won't be back to this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Nov 13, 2015~Most dangerous Starbucks! Drive through is very slow and people think nothing of backing up the line all the way on to Tatum. Very busy location that results in very long wait times in the morning even if you mobile order.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jan 19, 2017~The people in this place are rude, and prejudice. I keep coming back hoping the people will change. The ONLY person in this establishment that does not fit ANY of this criteria is Bee! Everyone else is incompetent!!! If you can't treat every customer with respect, then maybe you need to find another job! Just sayin!!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Oct 1, 2014~I'm a regular at this Starbucks.  What makes the difference is the employee's and the personalized attention you get coming in.  I come everyday and it is home.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Nov 12, 2016~Ordered a java chip frap for my niece and I, no java chips in our frap. Also our drinks were ready and sitting in the counter by the drive thru but we still waited about 5 mins for them to be given to us. My least favorite Starbucks by far.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Nov 2, 2015~This is the slowest drive thru I've ever been to, and believe me I go to many starbucks. It takes a good 5 minutes per person every time I've come here. It's truly unbelievable how slow it is. I try not to judge too quickly but the last 3 times I've come here after I pick my son up from school it is the slowest. I literally put my car in park while I'm waiting. I'm never coming here again!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jan 16, 2016~Terrible parking situation and always out of the Awake tea drinks.  Why don't they maybe stock more of their product.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Apr 7, 2016~Horrible parking, slow drive up windows. Interior of shop is dirty, crowded and had a fair share of freeloaders using WiFi without ordering, all the while taking up table space of actual customers. Received wrong order, then they corrected the order got a horrible cup of bitter coffee (latte)..wound up throwing it away. Tried again at a drive up window a week later. Again, got the wrong order and yet another cup of bitter latte..do they EVERY wash the coffee pots/machines here? Why is this the only Starbucks serving bitter crap!?!Run from this place..the worst Starbucks in AZ!!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~May 13, 2016~Why is this always the slowest Starbucks ? 20 min and counting at drive through for one small frappucino - at least twice I have ordered a sandwich waited forever hen when pulling up I hear we are all out --grrrrr
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Apr 8, 2016~Worst service of any Starbucks I've ever been to. I never write negative reviews, but I have received awful customer service twice...same person...When u run out of the sandwich I have a coupon for, why can't I use my coupon for a replacement sandwich? That's absurd and poor customer service that employees aren't either empowered to help or just plain too lazy to help. So disappointing!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Dec 10, 2015~Tried them 4 times since moving out to Desert Ridge. Each time I've been there I've received the incorrect drink each time. The label on the cup is correct but what they put in it is wrong. Also, seems as though they don't use their instruments properly as their drinks are always watered down as well. Super gross!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Aug 13, 2014~This Starbucks staff is awful. They are poor with customer service, they are sloppy and hand me dripping drinks every single day in the drive thru. They get my drink wrong often. They aren't very nice except for a few of them. I wouldn't stop here ever if there was another Starbucks on my way to work
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~May 24, 2018~I ordered a java chip frap with 6 scoops of java chips and soy milk before my final. Let me tell you that was not soy, that was dairy after a terrible stomach ache after drinking 1/4 of of my drink I took it and threw it in the garbage because my order was wrong and I couldn't drink it. Soy was written on the cup too bad it wasn't actually in the drink. Never coming to this Starbucks again instead of wasting those 15 minutes in the drive through it would've been quicker to take a 5 dollar bill and thrown it in the garbage. One word for this experience: disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Dec 14, 2014~I'd like to think that it was just me... I sat in a long line for an extra long time.  I wasn't feeling well so I needed a hot Calm Chamomile tea to help me feel human.  After waiting for what felt like an eternity, I finally reached the order window only to be told that they were out of the Calm.  Not their fault. So I asked what other teas (because I only order the Calm, and haven't the foggiest what else they offer) they have. The girl couldn't hear me... She had an attitude. `"Which do you want??`"  Oh no.  If you don't have anything nice to say... So I proceeded to move forward because this required a face to face transaction.  I finally reached the window and explained that I wasn't feeling well, so yelling into their intercom wasn't an option.  I, again, asked what was comparable to the Calm.  She recommended the Awake tea.  hmmmm Calm vs Awake seem like semi polar opposites, but ok.  (And of course, there was a `"thing`" with my 5 agave request; there always is.)  The Awake tea? No where near similar to the Calm.  Into the trash it went.  Won't be back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Mar 19, 2017~I hate Starbucks so much. If regulars come in then they put there drinks before anyone else's. I waited 20 minutes for 2 drinks while people behind me got their drinks way before mine. Never coming back again. Worst service ever. I'm sticking to Dutch bros.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~4~May 15, 2009~Aces!  No complaints good or bad.  Usually pretty busy inside like most Starbucks, as far as seating.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Nov 7, 2013~Bad service. Always out of stuff on a busy morning.... How can you run out of bold blend at 7:30 am. This is my third tint it happens. No sincere apology or offer a free drink for next time...
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Mar 19, 2016~Favorite Starbucks ever!! Every worker is fast, friendly, and knows what they are doing!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jan 8, 2017~They messed my drinks few times already. Last few months, I ordered white mocha online. They didn't put white mocha in my drinks two consecutive days. When I noticed something wrong with my drinks, I was already on my way to work. I couldn't bring them back. I decided not to use mobile order in the third day. I went to the store, put my order and told them what they had done. Everything went fine after that. Last month, I had problem a again with my drinks. And of course, they made mistake two consecutive days. Again, I went inside, told them what they had done. They apologized and everything went Okai till yesterday. I ordered white mocha online. They gave me a drink without espresso. Fortunately, I could come back this time. I asked one of the girls working there if I ordered it wrong. She confirmed that I ordered it right but they made it wrong. They remake my drink. Fine! I left my wrong drink and picked up the right one. This morning, I put the same order. I picked up my drink, checked before leaving the store, and of course again, there was not espresso in my drink. I asked the girl the fix it. After all, I hoped there was no more problem with my `"fixed`" drink. I had my first taste after 15 minutes away from the store. Of course, there was no espresso in my fixed drink. I couldn't believe what just happened. I called and let them know what they just did. The girl who made my drink told me I ordered it wrong....How could I order it wrong? I asked them yesterday, and they confirmed that I ordered it right... anyway, she told me she would put my name in the book, and I can come back and get one `"free drink`" I come back tonight, asked if I can have store credit for my drink. I will use for my mobile order in the morning as my convenience. The girl told me she can't give me store credit. They told me tomorrow morning I have to call them 30 minutes ahead to order my free drink. Okai. This is my frustration. It is not free drink because I didn't get what I paid for in the morning. I paid for what they call `"free drink`" They should make it more convenient for me. And also, they would not have to give me free drink if they make my drink right from the first time. ALL I NEED IS MY DRINK IS MADE RIGHT. I don't wanna come back to ask for my right drink second or third time, and be treated as someone asked for free drink. Another detail upset me. When I come back tonite, the girl told me she would not surprise if they messed up my drink in the morning because they are way too busy. Is that the sign of `"this happens all the time. Don't be surprised if you didn't get what you order for`" wowww... shocked me!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Feb 28, 2014~I absolutely love this Starbucks location! I come here almost every morning. The drive through can be a little long at times but inside is never a long wait. The workers are so nice and outgoing! Love this place! Easy 5 stars!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jun 25, 2015~I love Starbucks... what I don't love is waiting 20 minutes in the drive thru for my $15 order to be wrong and given to me with an eye roll and poor attitude!!! Don't go to this location!!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Oct 2, 2015~I ordered a Cold Brew and have been waiting for over 5 minutes. There is no one in line and 6 staff walking around. It is really a joke since cold brew is already Brewed!!!!  Wow service is simply the worst I have ever experienced. Still waiting. Amazing that the cashier who took my order ended up pouring cold brew into a pitcher that just sat there full. Imagine the concept that she could have poured mine into a cup and served me!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Sep 26, 2017~The acoustics are HORRIBLE. I was in this Starbucks briefly.  Hoping for a table to relax.  No tables available but even if there had been I wouldn't have stayed.  It's so LOUD.  All cement and tile interior. Nothing to absorb the cacophony. So many people having little business meetings.  Don't know how they could stand it. I had to repeat my order so the Barrista could hear me.  She admitted she goes home with a headache due to the noise.  I used the restroom and it was amazing how much quieter it was in the WC.  This isn't just an ambiance issue. This is a safety issue.  Management take note.   Put some fabric wall hangings in there and / or nice rugs.  I will never go back.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Apr 25, 2012~By far the slowest Starbucks I have been to. I have been here many times and i am always amazed at how long it takes to get in and out.  I live right up the street so hard to avoid but I definitely make a point to go to other locations if I am driving by one.  Just now, there was one person in front of me ordering a breakfast sandwich. From the time I walked in the door, it took 11 minutes to get an iced coffee in my hand.  I like Starbucks because I know what I am getting, but really dont enjoy going to this one in particular.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jul 19, 2013~This location has made me quit starbucks all together.  The last four times i've been there they have screwed up my order.  Thought maybe it was just the drive-thru that was screwing up, so i went inside.  There was one person waiting for their coffee, 1 person finishing up their order and then it was my turn.  Placed my order for my coffee and proceeded to wait TWENTY MINUTES.  What a joke.  I've been a gold member since 2010 - but luckily my pocketbook will get to keep any future `"reload`" amount since i am so dissatisfied with this company now i won't give them another dime.steer clear of this location if you want to keep enjoying your starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~4~Apr 29, 2007~You know, Starbucks always have the best coffee and you can find it anywhere. It's such a popular corporation. The fraps are delicious. The chai tea fraps are the best!
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Nov 17, 2016~Sadly, I just had the worst experience here and can no longer frequent this store.  After there was a system error with the mobile app and my order unknowingly went through twice, I got to the store and they had 2 drinks.  I tried to explain to the barista that I only ordered 1 and what might've happened, but she just shoved the drinks to me and said `"now you have 2.`"  When I asked if she could fix it, she just said Nope. While I appreciate that the mobile app is not their problem and I can see why baristas hate it, customer service is their business. It doesn't take any extra money or time to be kind and at least let me know how to contact the right department about mobile app issues.   I know you're a busy store and won't notice, but I won't be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Nov 12, 2016~This Starbucks is busy because of its location. The reason for our two star review is that they need to update this location's hours on yelp and on google. Google says it closes at 10:30pm on Saturdays. Yelp says 9:00pm. The door says 10:00pm and that is their actual closing time. We googled it and drove out of the way only to find a closed door at 10:04. Please update the hours and keep them updated. We are Starbucks addicted and need to knowwwww
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Oct 20, 2015~This is literally the worst Starbucks I have ever been to. I have to be at work at 6:00 AM at High Street. I stopped in at 5:50AM on Tuesday 10/20/15. The woman who took my order was rude and would not let me finish speaking before asking questions about the drink I ordered. I asked for a grande ICED caramel macchiato layered with breve. Once she finally got my order I stood there for ten minutes while the 4 women working there did basically nothing, with the exception of the young lady working the drive thru. The `"barista`" that finally decided to make my drink was dumbfounded as to what layered was. Seriously? Macchiatos are supposed to be layered!! And I was handed a hot drink when i asked for iced. This literally made me cry on my way to work as I was now ten minutes late. I will never come back here and will tell everyone I know never to come here either.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~Aug 10, 2011~I have never had any problems at this particular location. Have gone a few times a week for about 2 years and they were always polite, fast and got my order correct.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~4~Jul 14, 2014~They always make a great white chocolate mocha but the drive thru can be a little slow.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Aug 22, 2015~Starbucks, I'm talking to you. You regularly get orders wrong.  Today, my daughter ordered an unsweetened iced coffee for me and when she got home and gave it to me it was so sugary it could have been used as syrup. She said the order screen in the drive-thru read unsweetened.  I know she checked because of past problems with orders. I called and you cheerily said the next drink will `"be on us.`" No, it isn't because I already paid for one I can't drink.  You're four miles from my house and always have a line.  So, your solution is to inconvenience me twice.  How is that adequate? I always tip your batistas at least 30%, and get no positive karma from you. Hence the negative review on Yelp.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jul 17, 2013~I may have had the worst cup of coffee at this Starbucks. This visit made me make a commitment not to schedule any business meetings at any Starbucks again.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Dec 27, 2013~This place is terrible. They are always unprepared, slow and just unpleasant to do business with.  I am an avid starbucks customer and this is the worst location I have ever visited.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~May 1, 2014~Decent coffee consistently, but suuuuper busy a lot of the time which means long waits. Actually, with just a few cars, the drive through is sometimes still very slow. I've also gotten the wrong drink on a driving order. A cappuccino is not a macchiato. Cinnamon dolce isn't white mocha. :/
Phoenix, AZ 85050~3~Jul 16, 2014~This location always seems so busy. My drink always comes out to sweet at this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Jul 25, 2014~This applies to ALL Starbucks worldwide. Starbucks customers and future customers (their children) are some of the most pretentious individuals on this wonderful planet. Only in dire straights will I buy coffee (just coffee, not a  fancy `"grande mocca with a shot of vanilla soy based non fat carmelyate bullshit`". And we wonder why we are an obese society when we order a1000 calorie drink. It's not your slow metabolism, it's what you are ordering-drinking-eating and not moving that f*t *ss.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Nov 5, 2016~The worst drive through.  Always take at least 20 mins.  They need to hire more staff because this is just taking too long
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Sep 11, 2016~Ugg! Why do I even try with this location anymore?!?!?  This one I have had the worst experiences at. Tonight, I finally am annoyed enough to write here and calling the store in the morning.  I was only car in drive thru (imagine my shock!) , ordered Venti iced Pumpkin Chai Latte. Got to window, she read my order back, reloaded my card and the kid behind made the drink. Teens/20 something, Blonde hair, tall boy with no name tag. He hands me the drink with loaded whipped cream. I instantly take a sip and its horrible, he made a Pumpkin Spice Latte (sorry PSL drinkers, its just not my cup of tea). He offers to remake. Another car is now behind me. Second drink, I pull forward and take a sip, super strong and bitter, with after taste of burnt espresso. I pull over and park, go into store and let him know I would just like my money back as I am now running late to work. He says he'll remake it. I told him taste strongly of espresso and he said, `"Oh you didn't want espresso in it?`" I told him no. As he is looking for box cutters, he restocks the Tazo Chai bin with the new Tazo box of chai. He then starts to make my drink. He fills it with the pumpkin syrup, chai and milk to the middle line of the cup, then the rest with ICE. There is still a solid inch from the top of the lid. He grabs the whipped cream and I told him, `"No whip please `" and he proceeds to scoop out the dash he had started with a lid. I tell him that little bit is fine, that I must go and he tells me I need to let them know if I don't want whip cream because the chai comes with whip. I replied that's the first time I have heard that and have been asked at other starbucks if I wanted whip added and his response, `"well then they don't  know how how to make it.`" Dude! YOU just had to remake my drink 3 times! I think I am finally done going to this location. I paid almost $6 dollars for not even a full drink and it still does not taste right and is not being super watered down with all the ice.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Aug 3, 2024~This location had no one in line besides me and still messed up my drink. If you charge for sweet cream cold foam you should put it in the drink, it says it right on the sticker. This location also doesn't have the nugget ice.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Jan 1, 2024~2 days in a row as an Uber driver I was picking up orders here and both days staff was unprofessional and rude. First day New Year's Eve went in. I told him the order I was waiting for. I was waiting for about five minutes and second driver, who apparently knows people were who work there came in and she asked for her order even though both of our orders were sitting there, they packed hers, gave it to her and walked away. Tried to get someone's attention to pack my order and they ignored me. I had to go to the front cashier and asked them to please pack my order that was waiting there because I was waiting longer than the person that they just serviced. They didn't even apologize. They just packed the bag and gave it to me. Today I New Year's Day I went in to pick up another Uber order. When I approached the counter, nobody came to ask me if I need help. One of the staff members was having a personal conversation so loud where she was preparing coffee talking about how she hast to graduate in the summer because she hast to repeat a class after she was done talking I got her attention and asked her if she could hand me the order that was already prepared. When I grabbed her attention, she rolled her eyes at me. She handed me the bag and I was polite, and I said thank you very much and happy new year and she looked at me again and rolled her eyes and walked away. I'm not sure where staff lately anytime you tell them thank you or nice to somebody people just wanna act rude back. It's crazy in that environment. They expect tips with an attitude like that. When did people stop being happy just to do their job and just to be able to earn a living. If you don't like your job and don't wanna be around people then don't work there. It's clear from two days in a row with the same experience from two different employees that that's a toxic Starbucks environment.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Jun 15, 2021~My least favorite Starbucks in the valley. Maybe it's because it's located inside of albertson's? Not sure what the deal is but the customer service is awful. If you ask one question they will stare you down bitterly. Just an uncomfortable place to get your coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~4~May 21, 2019~Full Starbucks located inside of Albertsons. Well staffed for a grocery store location. Never had to wait long and my order has always been accurate. The only thing that sucks is they don't have a warmer so you can get a hot breakfast.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Jun 8, 2019~The location itself is fine and the employees are nice. My issue with this location is with the rewards. Apparently, if you make purchases at this location, you will not get credit for active offers listed in the app (for example, if the app says buy 2 refreshers before 9 am and get an additional 50 stars). You will get regular stars for your purchase, however, even if you meet the requirements of the special offers, you will not get the bonus stars. I understand that the app says `"participating stores`" but how am I supposed to know what stores are participating and which ones aren't?!? It doesn't tell you in the app and I didn't see anything at the Starbucks location that indicated that either. Sometimes I decide what to purchase based on if I can get bonus stars or not. So when I do what the app tells me to and I still don't get the bonus stars, I'm left disappointed and irritated.Starbucks really needs to rethink how they are doing this and let people know if they aren't going to get bonus credits at a particular location because when I make my purchase and don't get my stars, all it does is piss me off and make me rethink purchasing anything from that particular location in the future... piss me off enough and I will just stop patronizing the business...
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jun 24, 2024~Efficient, clean restaurant.   Friendly staff. And a pup cup for our dog.  I appreciate that!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Nov 26, 2024~Went and picked up a mobile order I placed in the Walmart and was told to wait 5 minutes next time, I said sure but was then accused in the drive through window that I ALWAYS place a mobile order and pick up right away. This is not true as my main order method is always in store or at drive through. If you want to educate customers on how long to wait, just ask politely. Accusing them of doing it all the time is ridiculous especially when I can show in my app order history that this was a blatant lie. Rude service and didn't even try to resolve my complaint at the Window, just started taking next order. Pic for proof of app history, my last mobile order was 2 weeks ago and I def do not pick up right away. Very rude
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 1, 2024~This is my go to Starbucks since it's on my way to work. Unfortunately I found a small FLY in my cold brew coffee this morning 5/1/2024 around 7:15am I didn't notice it until I was at work so I wasn't able to return to the store. I am disgusted that I drank a sip from my coffee prior to seeing the fly. I order coffee often so I immediately knew something was different just by the taste! I feel extremely nauseous and sick to my stomach. Please inspect your workspace prior to serving customers unsanitary drinks with flys! AFTER reading reviews for this location on Google apparently it's not the first time they've had insects in their drinks!!
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Apr 17, 2024~I work as a virtual assistant, and this is a great location. Super friendly staff, full menu, easy to connect to wifi,  &amp; no code needed for the bathroom. Full review can be found https://sites.google.com/abcdvirtualassistant.com/abcdvirtualassistant/blogs/starbucks
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Apr 1, 2023~The lady manager was continually  making  mobile  orders  and making  customers  that ordered  inside  the store  wait until  all mobile  orders were filled  , in my opinion  this is terrible  customers service  and she needs  to realize  that her regular  customers  are more  important .
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Dec 2, 2022~This location  has a drive  through : if you can handle  waiting  the coffee  is great  .
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 31, 2023~I got a grande nitro brew and I received it half full with foam. Once the foam settled, it was only half filled with coffee. And the worst part is that you have to leave a tip.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 4, 2023~I mobile ordered food &amp; drink from outside, waited for designated time (35-minute wait). Then walked in to pickup order, it wasn't ready. I had to wait another 15 minutes.Two white females with glasses, one tall &amp; short fat one. Both new to this location, I never seen them. The other employees working there know who I am. The 2 odd white females were rude after I told them I'm deaf &amp; I lipread. They both were yelling at me so it was difficult to read lips. One could enunciate, the other couldn't but she deliberately stood in front of the enunciated one. The company management are making my complaint a federal case by telling me when &amp; where to meet on their terms.Who the hell cares! I stood up to a couple of racists, ageists who don't know how to communicate but cause trouble and encourage customers to do the same.
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Mar 18, 2022~It seems Starbucks corporate has gone greedy &amp; forgotten their employees who work hard for their tips. They raised the prices and lower the quality of their drinks &amp; food. Every location is the same with quality &amp; prices. Now I'm unable to add tips to my mobile orders. I hope they have tip dispensers. The tea &amp; coffee are beginning to taste strange. The water for the drinks taste bad-different. The breakfast sandwiches, TBEWC is officially overpriced. They overheat SEF to burnt on the bottom. The salad is overpriced &amp; not WW-approved nor Atkins-friendly. The apple slices in the protein boxes are not fresh but frozen then thawed, it either taste mushy or old. Also overpriced. Sometimes 1 of the hard-boiled eggs in the protein boxes is bad. I had that happened several times. Some locations allow NO SOCIAL DISTANCING &amp; allow customers without masks get close to those who wear masks, that's DISRESPECTFUL. Dutch Bros have better-tasting drinks, &amp; Chick-Fil-a have not overpriced their breakfast sandwiches &amp; the salads (they have 3) to choose from with more ingredients in them. Fresh too!
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Jan 11, 2022~I love this location and there's always social distancing here. They always make the iced tea the way I like it, they make good coffee too. Occasionally I will miss `"my people`" when they have to close to stock up.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Feb 10, 2023~Worst starbucks, I normally will go to the one on 75th and Thunderbird and only stopped here because it was close to where I dropped my daughter off at.I ordered a everything bagel AND who knew you had to customize to get cream cheese... seems ridiculous. You employee sends me back in line to pay for cream cheese. Obviously if I wasnt rushing I would of come in and just ordered, the guys ordering a ton of drinks, so I had to leave so im not late to work. Worst experience by far definitely will try to avoid your location, apparently it was funny as well you guys should take notes from 75th and Thunderbird, they seem to be more courteous and respectful to people I rarely get bagels but common sense says put cream cheese with it and ask if someone doesnt  want it, how are you going to up charge for something like that? This was at 6:30am so the little guy making the drinks and the rude girl thought it was something to chuckle about.
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~May 9, 2022~It was a decent Starbucks, and I chose to go with the cold brew coffee when they informed me that they were out of espresso. The cold brew was fine. But I think most coffee shops, especially huge chains and not mom and pop shops should probably have some of the staples on hand.
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Jun 9, 2022~I have such a love/hate relationship with this location. Depending on my errands for the day- it is the most convenient. However, the inconsistencies at this location make me warry of going at all. There are days you order ahead of time, show up at the time estimated by the app and still wait 15 minutes to get your order. Other times, the store is empty and your drink is done on time. I think there needs to be better management (seems the drive thru takes prescience over online or in person orders) - maybe if you cannot handle online, close the online option when you are busy?  Also, this is a challenging location for parking and leaving the parking lot- so choose wisely! Good luck fellow coffee lovers.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Mar 10, 2022~Don't come here if you want to work or spend and amount of time within the store. They have a gnat problem that no one's addressing as it was like this last time I came here also. Here's to hoping the manager sees this and takes action to eliminate there infestation.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Feb 10, 2023~This is the slowest most disorganized Starbucks I've ever been to. Took 45 min to get 3 coffees!!!
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Nov 24, 2020~Coffee is ok but they are the SLOWEST Starbucks I've ever been to and they have a new crew that is terrible and confused all the time.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Feb 5, 2022~This is the second time in a week I've ordered coffee and I've received it almost half empty one of the times I went to the Starbucks myself today I ordered Postmates
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Feb 1, 2022~My coffee was a quarter empty when I got it? Is there a reason my drink wasn't full? I didn't pay for a grande I paid for a venti! So not all bad but they definitely don't fill the coffees properly I don't know why this is so much more empty then when I order it other locations? Maybe they don't do espresso and they try and cheat with coffee because I can't taste the espresso. Either way disappointed because it's not my usual morning jolt that i was looking for
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 22, 2021~Rude employees, especially the employee that has black silverish hair and the 1960's style of glasses. Covered up her name badge when I asked for her name. Said `"I don't give a F*ck.`" When I told her I would be addressing her attitude with her HQ.Response: `"You probably should, I don't see any guys wanting to hit that for money..`"
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jul 28, 2023~Ordered 30 min ahead, had somewhere to be. ANY other Starbucks I've been to has the drink ready in about 10 min or so. Waited 30 minutes, made me late, not the first time I've been here and was very disappointed
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Apr 23, 2021~The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the wait time is always long.  However it is the best customer service of any Starbucks in this area of town and makes the wait worth it!  If you haven't tried it yet ... my go to is the Guava Green Tea with a splash of lemonade and no sweetener!
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jun 14, 2023~For as busy as the Barista's are they provide great service to those who are dependent on caffeine to get through the day. I see them creating customers by name, and smiling at everyone who comes through the line. I came in with my 16 year-old daughter, who really doesn't drink coffee, and Libby showed patience with her while we figured out what she would like. My mistake though, probably just hooked her on the brand! Great service and nice workers!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Apr 27, 2022~If I could give this place zero I would. Third time I have been here and the disorganization is palpable.Wrong drinks . Wrong names. Wait forever for drinks. Staff running around like headless chickens. Stinks of poor management.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Apr 9, 2022~I paid $6 for half a drink. They didn't even attempt to fill it all the way. I did not take a drink at all, this was how it was handed to me. This is outrageous. Every time I come to this Starbucks, I have to wait 15-30 mins for a drink.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Sep 25, 2018~Michael and Ruby are amazing.Get coffee from them.Lots and lots and lots of coffee.
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Nov 25, 2022~This location has gone to crap. The mobile orders are never ready by the stated time. Always out of something and totally unfriendly. Only reason they get the 3 stars is because the coffee is still good.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Oct 24, 2019~Probably one of the SLOWEST Starbucks drive thru I've ever been to!!! Im like 4th-5th in line and 20-25 mins later I have my drink finally!! I'm avoiding this particular one from now on!Window guy doesn't even acknowledge  the ridiculous wait time..Almost late to my son's appointment!
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Oct 17, 2021~Twenty minutes for a simple mobile ice tea! Total chaos behind the counter.( for those working others just standing around)
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Nov 26, 2022~this guy helped me and he was so sweet and helpful really made my day!! you know who you are:) girl was kinda mean though tbh
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Dec 1, 2019~I'm not usually one to rate a chain. I figure one Starbucks is much like another, maybe some are a little smaller, some are a little busier; I'm definitely not going to get mad if my drink takes a little longer because one day one of them happens to be short-staffed, etc. BUT. This Starbucks has freaking code-locks on the bathroom doors. ARE YOU SERIOUS? I came here (got dropped off) to do work for several hours. I am drinking coffee but have to go to the bathroom frequently regardless. Now I have to ask an employee to unlock the door every time I need to pee? This is embarrassing, and I'm also pretty sure it goes against the new policies that Starbucks supposedly rolled out a good long while ago to be more friendly towards patrons. (So you're saying that people can sit in Starbucks without ordering anything, but they can't use the bathroom unless they do? Otherwise, why bother with the locks?!?!?) Never coming here again (but maybe they are intentionally trying to discourage people from hanging out inside of the store?) WOMP-WOMP!
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Nov 6, 2020~ordered through a mobile app and the two sandwiches i ordered were missing and one of the drinks wasn't even full or completely coldtwo stars because the drinks taste fine and delivery was fast but half my order was missing
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Oct 29, 2020~I ordered a chai tea latte with cold foam through Uber eats , and they thought it may have been a mistake since I didn't order it iced. Since they weren't sure they made me two!!! One iced and one hot. Made my day
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Apr 13, 2019~What can I say a beautiful day require a frappe. Let me for drive thru was huge but about 3 minutes in total which is not bad and my drink was made with perfection and boy does it taste good. I like the closeness and will come by more often
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Aug 24, 2019~This is my go to Starbucks. I always put in my mobile order and walk in and grab. The baristas are always really friendly and there is never a wait. There is a few tables to sit at which is not as much sitting place as others but it works. The only reason I gave this review 4 stars instead of 5 is the parking. It's horrible!!! The drive thru line will wrap in front of the businesses next to Starbucks and it traps people in the tiny parking lot waiting for the endless line of coffee fiends to pull up out of the way. This is the reason why I park closer to Walmart (I like getting my steps in anyway) and walking up to grab my mobile order. I am not sure if the parking lot can even be expanded due to the other businesses but I assume this hinders some business. I have saw plenty of people pull into the lot then drive away because of the line. I will continue to come here though because it's close to my house and the baristas are great as always!
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Sep 8, 2021~I ordered a venti americano and they gave it to me pretty much half full. I told the girl my drink isn't a venti and halfway full in the cup. She just apologized. So I left. So I won't be back to this Starbucks.
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Mar 8, 2017~Ive only gone through the drive through at this location. The driveway is a little tricky but then again Im starting to think thats Starbucks trademark LOL.Staff is pretty nice. Ive noticed a huge difference between Starbucks employees in the west valley vs the east valley.  Staff is way more bubbly in the east valley. That wont keep me from driving through starbucks for my ice tea though
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 27, 2022~i paid for extra caramel drizzle and i see not even a ounce of caramel in my cup the store was completely empty there was no excuse or reason why i shouldn't have gotten the extra caramel drizzle. just lazy
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 20, 2022~Location over staffed but still expect long wait times through the drive thru. Do not recommend this location. I believe the problem is the store manager.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Dec 9, 2020~Extremely slow drive thru service today.  Staff are always friendly, but slowness seems to be  chronic issue at this location.
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Mar 11, 2021~how am i gonna order a turkey bacon sandwich and get a sandwich with one slice of ham and egg... not a single piece of bacon lol $5 for shit
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Sep 13, 2020~Bless these poor people having to deal with a mountain of complicated drive-thru, mobile, online, and walk-in orders all at the same time. They're moving as fast as their legs and arms will go, and they have to deal with customers not wearing masks in the process of trying to fill orders while also keeping to new standards as well. Excellent service today, and my drinks were perfect. Thank you very much, you are all clearly trying your best and it is just right. I'm gonna say this next part here because I know if I send it over to corporate it'll just get a chuckle if I get lucky enough that someone will take the time to read it, and this did NOT factor in to my rating at all. I just want to scream into the ether. To put in an online order you have to, no way around it, sign up for a Starbucks card and you have to, no way around this either, put money into it on your first online order. Bullcrap. Other places let me just place an order as a guest without signing up for anything and Starbucks should be no exception to that. I should not have to spend twice as much just to order online so I don't have to wait 15 minutes in the drive thru. There's no excuse for that other than greed from a company that makes plenty already. I don't go to Starbucks very often (maybe once or twice a year at most) and this does not make me wanna go back, not even to use the $15 I was forced to load onto the card. I'd rather just call that money a loss rather than spend it.Thank you again to the wonderful employees working at this location; you're all awesome! Keep doing what your doing and I hope you all stay safe and healthy! Starbucks itself can kiss it.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Dec 12, 2019~Drinks are always on point but also the staff is always amazing to me and my family! Ty for that! 1 of my favorite Starbucks in the valley.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Dec 6, 2019~I'm not one to complain but I'm super peeved at how rude our drive through barista was. We went today(12/6) at 3:00pm and when we were handed our first part of our order we said thank you and she completely ignored us. We got our final drink almost 5 minutes later(seriously, for a medium peppermint mocha?) and we once again said thank you and all she did was walk away. Seriously, it cost $0.00 to say YOU'RE WELCOME. You know what else cost $0.00? Kindness. I'm not a nit picky person at all but her whole demeanor from the start was just so unwelcoming. I'll think twice about coming to this location again.
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Jul 30, 2015~I go to Starbucks almost every day and have for the last 5 years or so. I don't go there for their great tasting coffee as I don't like the taste of their coffee. Most of my time is split between two Starbucks each about a mile and a half from my house. It is a morning ritual which happens between 5:00 and 7:00. I use two means of transportation a golf cart and a 1929 chevy two door sedan and on occasion I have walked the distance. Oh! So why go to Starbucks? I like expresso. Their expresso is drinkable but no where great. If you want good expresso go to a place that still has manual machines. I go there to start my day and take my little dog to get a treat. She is blind and loves the outing and a treat of pumpkin loaf bread. I buy a slice and that does her for about 5 to 7 days. She just gets a little everyday. I am not aloud to have any. My drink used to be 2 shots of expresso with a inch of foam on top. I have changed that to 3 shots of expresso and a inch and a half of heavy cream. May be hot or sometimes over ice. They do a good job but some people have trouble with how much a inch and a half is. It usually ends up being half inch which is ok also. The store is always clean and everyone is very nice and friendly.Some dislikes with all Starbucks is the employee turnover seems to be high so you may get someone that is not customer orientated. Also they ask your name to put on the drink and almost always they get my name wrong. This aggravates me so I usually just give them my dogs name or a fictitious name I know they will get right.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 3, 2019~Normally this place is ok, o don't know if new employees but On my way!. 15 min in drive thru, three cars then my heavy ice drink the ice all meted , soooo disappointing, when I showed them they laughed lol really they just don't care
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Nov 23, 2020~I sat in the drive through for 30 minutes to pick up a mobile order that I had placed. This is the slowest location I have ever been to. This is ridiculous. They should offer curbside pick up like other locations. And then my order was wrong. Go figure.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jul 20, 2019~I literally have 9 Starbucks in a four mile radius of me, and I choose this one to go to whenever the Starbucks urge hits. I was only going to give it four stars due to its location because it's sort of a pain in the rear sometimes in that parking lot but they really do a fantastic job dealing with it inside. They are quick, the drinks are great, and they always have a great attitude. So 5 stars it is with an asterisk on wish they had a better parking lot arrangement. But like I said, it's not bad enough to make me go to another one that's close by. Oh,,, and that new S'mores Frappuccino is flat out YUM!!!  Thanks Starbucks... you're not really helping me with this Frappe addiction!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Nov 4, 2022~why are pumpkin spiced lattes no longer in season???!!! fyi its still fall!!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 23, 2019~I frequent this Starbucks for two reasons, 1 of the few having a drive thru and 2 it's closest to home. For some reason they struggle to get my order accurate though, on multiple occasions. Yesterday I ordered a mocha cookie crumble frap with a double shot for the happy hour special. Not only were there `"no shots`" but the cookie crumble and chocolate sauce were left off as well. Starbucks is always busy so for me that's no excuse considering the price, even half off.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Dec 13, 2019~This has to be the SLOWEST Starbucks ever. Ive been here about 10 times over 2 years and it never gets better. Yes, I know I should stop going there but there's no other Starbucks close by. 15-20 minutes for an Americano? At least 20 minutes in a drive thru minimum each time you go. What is happening at this location? When I go to Chicago there are 10 times the customers but it's also 10 times faster. Someone send some trainers to this location.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Dec 6, 2021~This starbucks is the worst. They always have new employees and noone ever knows the menu. They also never have all your drinks ready. Dont do group orders they always forget one and make you wait until all drinks are cold or melted.
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Feb 24, 2019~The service is usually fine but this location has been out of the tea for the medicine ball the last two times I've come. The similar tea is fine but with it being flu and cold season this location should be sure to stock up more of the tea to make the medicine balls.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 28, 2021~They are so slow. Left without my drink and food with no refund. After waiting for 30 min inside
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jan 29, 2021~I went to this location early this am to get a latte for me and egg bites for my dogs. It's their weekly treat and mine. When l ordered the girl who took my order was rude from the get-go. You hear a lot more than a voice on that intercom. When I got to the window, she was throwing the food packages on the counter. When she asked about my order, no hello no how are you just a monotone repeat of my order. When my dog who had the audacity to bark (which she hardly ever does), then came the huffing  and eye rolling. I left without paying and without my order.  I did nothing to be treated in such a rude manner. This girl should be thankful she has a job. I'm an RN in a very busy ER and this was something I was looking forward to all week to do with my dogs. We went to McDonald's instead. I can see why this location is rated so low. I'm finding a new one to go to.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Oct 10, 2016~Longest Starbucks wait at a drive through ever, and it's not even `"busy`". It's 2 pm on a Monday and the line hasn't moved and when I got up to order they told me to `"hold on a minute,please`" when everyone had apparently been holding on like 15 minutes or more. What gives? If you're in a rush do not use the drive thru service at this location! (Luckily I wasn't, but wouldn't have been happy if I was!)  my drink was also made wrong and the girl at the window seemed like she didn't know how to multi task. I also wasn't even given a receipt.
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Mar 27, 2020~I love coming to this location the staff is always so friendly! They never mess up on my orders and they always make good conversation! You guys rock!
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Feb 8, 2020~My only complaint is the very looong wait time. Unfortunately this is the closest Starbucks to my work. Every time I come here I wait about 10-20 minutes in the drive thru.
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Mar 9, 2014~Tried the drive-thru and staff was great, took three different orders in one car! Tried the vanilla macchiato and the Vegetable &amp; Fontiago Breakfast Sandwich.Vanilla Macchiato - So GoodVegetable &amp; Fontiago - Delicious Never knew (now I do) that Starbucks serves a good breakfast.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Jul 30, 2019~Second time going to this location. First visit went flawlessly. I received my coffee in a timely manner given the amount of people ordering and what I saw from the drive thru lane. It was delicious and fresh, as I would expect to receive as a walk in customer. Second visit was horrendous...ordered the same drink, waited 10-15 minutes. There were no long lines and the drive thru was sparse. A gentleman who was waiting before me appeared to have been there forever as well, because one of the older staff checked on him and had to tell someone to get him his drink. When my drink finally gets to me it looks like it was either sitting in the back or the foam had been poorly done as it had begun mixing into the cold brew already. The cream had almost made it to the bottom of the cup when they handed it to me...the best part of that drink is watching it slowly mix into the cold brew...Very poor experience, I was severely disappointed. I doubt I will be returning to this location.  I gave it two stars because my first visit went well. Hopefully they can become consistent in the future.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Oct 30, 2019~Awesome customer service by two gentlemen tonight on 10/30/19 at around 7pm in the drive-thru. Though despite being out of multiple items on the daily menu, by no fault of the workers, they tried really hard to make sure I got something I liked and made sure my drink was to my liking. 10/10 will be coming back
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 12, 2019~Learn how to properly make coffee. All I asked for was a venti pike place hot coffee with cream and sugar. This is the third time you guys have forgot the most simple part. CREAM AND SUGAR! highly disappointed
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Aug 19, 2017~Our favorite Starbucks! It is close to home. The staff is always very friendly. As a regular it is comforting when they remember your name and drink. Really enjoy the long countertop they installed when I need to take advantage of the wifi. This store is very busy so sometimes you have to be patient, but it is worth the wait!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jan 5, 2021~I understand there's limitations because of COVID.  But literately every other location surrounding this one has it together. If I place a mobile order, I wait about 30 minutes or so before my drink is ready (after waiting 10 minutes before heading there). If I go through the drive through, I wait about 30-45 minutes in line (with maybe 5-7 cars ahead of me). They are SLOW. And to add insult to injury, my drink tastes horrible almost every time. They forget ingredients or don't put enough in or put too much. It's ALWAYS inconsistent. I can't waste time or money here anymore. I feel bad leaving this review but something HAS to change. I live 1/4 of a mile away and decided this morning after waiting in the drive thru for 15 minutes with no movement (6 cars in front of me) that I was going to drive to 83rd and TBird. I waited in line and got my drinks (made perfectly) in less than 10 minutes with 13 cars ahead of me at TBird. So what gives?? Please for the sake of everyone GET IT TOGETHER. Figure it out. PLEASE.
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Jul 22, 2016~Prob one of the worse Starbucks I have gone too. The coffee was not made right and not that this affected me but there was a guy one person in front of me and he hadn't received his order. I had 2 drinks and the girl in front of me had 6 and yet his drink never came. I think they might have forgotten it because they seemed very disorganized. For the amount of people working they only had one person taking orders and one person making the drinks while the others just seemed to be staying `"busy`" not sure I will come back to this one since my drink was not very good and the service was not that great either.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Aug 21, 2018~Micheal was super sweet and helped me get a drink i enjoyed ! Drink was bomb! Thank you Micheal for great customer service skills !
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Nov 15, 2017~Drove right up to the order screen as there wasn't a line.  The lady was having difficulty hearing but acknowledged she got the order.  Waited about 10minutes behind 1 car that was at the window. Pulled up, she asked for my order again, quoted me $9.37 and took my card.  Stuck the card in the machine, window shut and she walked away.  About ten minutes later brought me the croissant for my son, no drink.  Waited another 7 or so min, got my drink.  Because this is a usual order and I know the amount quoted wasn't correct, I asked for a receipt.  She played with the screen for another 5min only to realize she never charged me.  rerung my order, never told me the amount.  Just looked at the bank statement and it was still $9.37.  My drink is not right either.  And we were late to a baseball game because of the wait.  So not a great experience today.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jun 17, 2020~I have always been loyal to Starbucks but my last few experiences have made me decide to switch to Dutch Bros or local brewers permanently. Every time I visit and order an iced drink there is so much ice in the cup I'm literally paying for 4 sips of a drink. I shouldn't have to specify light ice in order to get more than 4oz of liquid. In addition, my last visit I ordered 2 strawberry refreshers. The employee told me they were recalled and unavailable. That's fine, so I order a different flavor refresher and come up to the window and pay. Then the girl (who didn't greet me or show any friendliness at all) hands me my drinks. Both the drinks look like iced water and the girl doesn't even say anything. So I look at her confused and she goes `"oh..we're out of the berries and the stuff that gives it color but it tastes the same`". She didn't offer an explanation, apology or discount. I shouldn't pay $8 for two waters. If the ingredients are not available then say so when the person is ordering or at least say `"hey we took care of one of these since half the fucking ingredients are missing.`" I'm over Starbucks. Byes
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jul 25, 2019~Not a great Starbucks.. Their package foods sit and they do not look at them before they sell you a 6 dollar 1/2 sandwich.. The line is always long and they really put no effort into not making people wait 15 plus minuets for a drink..
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Feb 5, 2019~This Starbucks is the closest to my house but only like a few here Michael Cody and Lewis they always do great
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Dec 11, 2019~Your order will never be correct, not that they give you the wrong item, they DO NOT KNOW how to make drinks. Your drink will taste different, look different and suck if you go here. Window people are usually rude also. TRAIN THESE PEOPLE PLEASE!
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Jul 12, 2015~The customer service provided in this location is great!  The employees are friendly, happy and courteous.  They manage to keep a consistent positive attitude regardless of how busy they are as this place is non-stop busy with customers in the lobby and drive-thru. The second part of this review is the facility itself and the layout of the place.  It feels cramped inside with cups and mugs display all around the store.  There are cups and mug displays against the wall by the front entrance that is also near where the line ends on their busy day while also having a small walkway to their tables.  Too many traffic in this one little area and it may cause hazard.  Perhaps changing the layout in an already small space will feel more like it's a relaxed environment.Most importantly, since this location is constantly busy, the employees do not have time to maintain cleanliness of their facility.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Dec 14, 2018~I love this Starbucks! I feel so lucky that this is the Starbucks closest to my work because going here brightens my morning every morning. The employees are so friendly, professional, and seem to genuinely care about their customers and quality products. I order through mobile and almost never have to wait and when I do have to wait, even for just a minute, they are apologetic. Alec is especially friendly and chats with customers while still quickly making quality drinks! Thank you Starbucks!
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Nov 18, 2015~My fav starbucks! Lisa and David are the best! Always friendly and smiling . This is a busy location but they do a great job getting people their drinks quick. Online ordering is so awesome. My drink is always ready and perfect.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Oct 20, 2016~I've been going to this location for a while because its the closest location to my house. The staff are friendly and acting their 'energetic starbucksy' selves, which is to be expected. My only big gripe is the drive through. I've sat in the line numerous times over half an hour, even when there was only 1 car in front of me. I don't know if their priorities are off or what, but it is ALWAYS slow. It took me quite a few visits to learn to just go inside. If I go inside, I am usually out in 5 mins no matter how busy they are. Word of advice, do not park on the storefront side, you WILL get stuck because of the long line of the drive through. It blocks all the cars in the spots and you will be sitting for a long time. Instead park behind the building in the walmart parking lot, it's always open.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Jul 29, 2017~Service is incredibly slow. Even though it's a convenient location, the staff does not seem friendly and the service is slow. The day does not matter. Very shocked since this is the pattern for many months now. Service level agreement with mobile was bad today for me. It took 15 min for my mobile order to come in. Love my Starbucks, but disappointed at this location.
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Jan 25, 2017~First time going inside to this Starbucks. Everyone is friendly and energetic. Seating is usually an issue with some Starbucks and this one had plenty! (Maybe I was there before the rush)I appreciate them opening up another cashier to move the line along.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 30, 2019~Today my sister and I went to this location. The drive thru line was long, so we went in. We ordered 3 drinks. 2 of our drinks came out in a timely manner. However, the last drink never came. I asked one of the baristas if my drink was coming out. She asked me what my order was. Then told me all my drinks were coming out together. She clearly didn't understand my question, considering I got 2 of the 3. I waited a total of 27 min. I went to the register and asked about my drink. The cashier was new and had no idea what happened/what to do. Turns out, they put my order with the mobile orders and someone else took it. I called and talked to the shift lead, Cece. She made excuses for what happened. Every time I tried to say one word she would cut me off/interrupted me. Will not be getting coffee at this location anymore.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Nov 26, 2020~This particular Starbucks (67th Ave/Peoria) is consistently behind, on every single visit. Every mobile order I have ever made at this location takes 20+ minutes. Today it was 35 and I had to leave without my drink!! What's even more frustrating is that Starbucks customer service is not open today due to the holiday, so I cannot request a refund of the coffee I've already paid for. I watched them repeatedly make drinks out of order, including for walk in customers, when I had already asked for my drink 2-3 times. If I had the time to wait around, I wouldn't have any need to order ahead of time!!
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Jan 31, 2017~No improvements. Drive thru line takes a minimum of 15 minutes and drinks never taste right.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Aug 23, 2014~I'm honestly not very happy with this location. The service seriously pissed me off. Went through the drive thru, tried to place my order and was interrupted every time with `"will that complete your oder`" `"is that all for you today`" ummmm I'll be done when I actually have a chance to stop speaking. I hate hate hate being cut off. Do tou or do you not want me to spend my money here? I only had four drinks btw.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Nov 3, 2019~I can see why this Starbucks gets so many bad reviews. Took them 30 mins to make my drink, phone order btw. The barista made so many mistakes with everyone's order. People all went through the drive through came back in to get their coffee remade. All the workers looked lost. Very disappointed with the service and quality.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jul 26, 2018~The customers are super friendly and fun! I come here with my boyfriend quite often and our experience has always been great! Our coffees always taste amazing and the environment is chill and inviting! I recommend coming here 100%!!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 3, 2016~I will never go here again! I've been here several times over the years..mostly in the drive thru and just a few times inside. Never fails..these people have No customer service skills! They hand your drink out the window and turn their heads..no Thank You, Nothing! I even ordered on the app so my drinks would be ready when I walked in. I went to the pick up area, as instructed on the app and totally got ignored. An employee even stopped right in front of me to fill the straws and started chatting with the guy behind the counter..Like I was invisible! 8 out of 10 times have been a bad experience here!
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Dec 8, 2014~My favorite Starbucks to go to! They're so kind and my favorite sandwich from here is the vegetable and fontiago. It's delish! Recommend this location it's great!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Nov 7, 2019~This Starbucks is the worst. I'll mobile order 15ish minutes in advance at 6:15 am and still have to wait 5-10 minutes once I'm in the store. They keep people on bar that can't make a drink in less than 5 minutes if their life depended on it. It's my only coffee spot on the way to work, and I hope anything else opens up soon.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 27, 2019~Waited 40+ minutes in the drive thru today. There was maybe 5 cars in front of me. There was no explanation when i got to the window either. Should've just went to dutch bros like usual but decided to get something quick. The coffee was watered down and the caramel frap tasted as if it was sitting out for an hour. Highly disappointed
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Apr 21, 2017~Sitting here in the drive-thru right and have been waiting for about 10 mins now, with 3 cars ahead of me and 3-4 car behind me. Finally get to order the limited UNICORN FRAPPE and the male tells me they're out of the ingredients and can't make it. Seriously?! Time could have been prevented had there been a sign. Still here in line because I'm trapped until the cars ahead of me get their order. Great. Just great. And disappointed. LOL.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 5, 2019~I ordered a simple iced Venti Matcha Green tea latte and waited 15 minutes in the lobby for it. People who were there before me got their drinks and it made sense. But a new batch of people came in and they all got theirs before mine?? Anyways, I'm feeling fidgety because I just want my green tea before I go take my exam for school. So I just take my drink and head out immediately when they call my name. And of course the parking lot is so tight that I couldn't even back out of my space for 5 minutes because the drive thru line completely blocked me off. Finally, I'm on the road and I take a sip of my tea. I get a mouthful of matcha powder!! The bottom of my cup is unmixed matcha powder just sitting there clumped and solid. So now I'm trying to mix it and break apart the solid parts for the 5 minutes it takes me to get to school. Finally it's somewhat mixed with some clumps that still wont break a part. My god. I'm never coming back to this Starbucks.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jul 8, 2019~Always have great service. Eileen was absolutely wonderful! We tried a drink with a different milk and weren't a huge fan but she gracefully replaced my drink without any problem!
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Dec 16, 2015~I have come many times here and it's never improved. Boy Oh boy are they slow! I'm actually writing this review right now in the drive thru lane. I wonder if being inside is just as slow.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jul 4, 2016~Slowest drive thru that I have EVER experienced!! While waiting, two cars left the line making my wait not as unbearable..
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Aug 28, 2016~I'm giving this place a 3 because the cashier he was nice..I told him i wanted my turkey pesto lightly toasted not pippin hot. He told the the employee with the short black bob hair to lightly cook it. She said so she dont want it cooked? He said it again no lightly toasted she well ill take it out puts it in and walks away. The cashiers looking at her...if she would have just stood there for just a second I would not be writing this review. When I got my sandwich it was pippin hot...cheese melt can't hold it hot....and her attitude wasn't very nice she looked like it was a bother to just likely cook it...
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jan 7, 2018~Worst Starbucks in my area, I waited for 20-25 minutes just to get my order at the window. When I received my coffee I almost threw up because of how watered down and nasty it tasted. Never in my life going to this spot again.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Apr 28, 2017~I had 3 free sandwiches and presented to my local Starbucks location (6649 W Peoria Ave, Glendale, AZ) and was declined to use them there because I didn't originally buy the coffees there that rewarded me with the free sandwiches.  This seems wrong why does it matter where I bought the coffee; my money was still spent at Starbucks, so I left and went to McDonalds for my coffee and breakfast sandwiches this morning.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Apr 26, 2018~My wife and I have been going to this location 2 times a day for the last 14 days. We get the same thing every-time (2 tall hot americanos with steamed extra heavy cream) and have always been charged $5.40 every single time. Well, Wednesday evening my wife and I went for our nightly walk and coffee, as we ordered our drinks the young lady behind the counter (Eileen) was going to charge almost $7 for our drinks. My wife asked why had the price changed and the lady behind the counter was rude and said that `"who ever charged us $5.40 was wrong.`" And that if we don't pay the higher price we don't get extra cream. After being treated rudely and knowing that she was not going to make our drinks the way we liked I asked her to refund the money and take back their drinks. It is hard for me to believe that other stores including this store has been charging us incorrectly for our drinks. I've had numerous encounters of poor customer service here but have always shrugged it off since this store is within walking distance from my home and both my wife and I are able to start and end our day doing something we both enjoy (drink coffee). I will no longer be coming to this location.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 14, 2016~Other then the fact that it's always super slow to get my coffee here regardless if I use the drive thru or go inside but I can't even order thru my mobile app because they always screw up my order. They don't even read what's being ordered. I ordered a white chocolate mocha and they gave me hot chocolate milk. Like wtf?!
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Apr 8, 2016~I go out of my way to come to this location. Len is always super friendly, and the other guy that works the drive thru too. I don't remember his name but always says something cheesy that makes my day like `"thanks a latte`" or `"have a grande`" whenever I leave. Truly makes a difference when you have good service like you do at this one. Always pretty fast but I would wait in line for the cheesy sayings!
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Mar 25, 2017~I love this vivacious Starbucks and the atmosphere. The employees are always happy and so are the customers. They are normally busy becuz people love to go there, which is a sign of a happy place to go
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Apr 23, 2015~Horrible place ! Went through the drive through and I told the lady i want to reload my card and she never did she took my debit card and. Charge me for the drinks witch was $8 and I was like I want to put $5 on my card and she said okay and guess what the $5 never came on my card . And I called and complain and talk to the manager and told her that the girl charge me the eight dollars and the five dollars . And I told her none of that money went on my Starbucks card . And I told her I was on my way to work and I couldn't turn around to get my refund and she said well if you don't come back today the transaction is closed and we can do anything. It was honestly bullshit never again will I go there
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jan 15, 2018~I agree with some of the other posters.  Horrible wait in the drive-through.  Half the time I've been there the drink has not been right.  But if you bring it to your attention you have to wait another 10 minutes.   I don't know what's up with this location but the drive-through is horrendous.  No other Starbucks location that I've been to has taken so long to get an order i skip this location now because they're horrible
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Nov 23, 2015~Loved the customer service I got the other day from a nice young man named Len. He was working drive thru and I was a pretty complicated customer with my very specific drink instructions (trying to figure out what I wanted Lol) but he was very kind, made me laugh, he knew what he was doing and most importantly he worked with me and my picky taste buds! He deserves a raise! Thanks Len!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 13, 2015~They were out of Caramel Drizzle at 6:00 am on a Wednesday Morning! The Barista on Hot Bar was very rude about it and read out loud what was on the Chalkboard. I usually always order the same thing and don't look around at everything that has writing on it. She was very rude!!!!!
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Sep 13, 2016~Was my favorite coffee shop in the Starbucks chain... But times are changing and this is just beyond rude, no manners, fill rushed, don't listen to what you order, etc!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Dec 27, 2017~Not coming to this location again. I noticed they keep getting customers' orders wrong, so the drive thru line takes forever. But what disappointed me was I ordered a latte with no ice, and they filled the cup 3/4 of the way. I asked nicely if they can fill my cup to the top simply to get my money's worth and the employee AMANDA rolled her eyes at me, took my cup, and gave it back with the fakest smile ever. It's the holidays, there's no need for the attitude!
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Dec 6, 2012~Why on earth would I review a Starbucks, right? I mean, lets face it, Starbucks experiences are fairly run of the mill.  Anyone who hasn't had a beverage from Starbucks has probably just crawled out of their bomb shelter because their 30 year supply of freeze dried astronaut food has run out.  Once they get over the shock that the 'big one' never hit and there is no longer a USSR they will quickly have their first Starbucks experience.  But I digress.   I have one reason to leave this review:  the girl that ran drive thru that one time I went knocked my M F'ing socks off.  I don't often do Starbucks, however I am a sucker for one thing: you put the word salted in front of caramel and I am there. Starbucks did just that so there I was, looking for a salted caramel mocha fix before class.  No time, so I chose drive thru where I was greeted by the most chipper voice I have ever encountered.  Now one might think 'well yeah, if I was surrounded by untold amounts of caffeine I too would be perky at work.'  But no my friends, this was a whole new level of happy, whoville had nothing on her, the Grinch would have had no shot stealing cheer from this drive thru, his heart would have exploded.  Her sunny disposition would not have simply defeated the Grinch, it would have made him dead.She commended my salted caramel choice, I felt proud.  She suggested a venti, which is far too much caffeine for me but I could not resist.  She said I deserved it, and I believed her.  She was excited to swipe my credit card, complimented my hair, and handed me my beverage.  I didn't even need that coffee, her personality was infectious, I was ready to Carpe Diem!! or Yolo for the younger crowd.Then someone stole my parking spot at school and that was over, but I still had the coffee and it was good.Either way, that girl, whose name I don't know, that one time I went to this Starbucks knocked my socks off, and for that I thank her.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Jun 13, 2018~did not acknowledge me when I came in just looked at me. I went to grab my drink no one said anything to me. seems to be selective on which customers to acknowledge. Girl Micky did not say anything to me, but when another customer came up to grab their drink she said something. made me not feel welcomed.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 13, 2012~I'm been here numerous times and received *okay* service, but this last time it was just terrible! Typically I'm there to meet clients as Starbucks is generally a nice place to do so in a quiet, relaxing atmosphere. Let's start by saying my name is Morgan. Yes Morgan, a unisex name. I am a girl and have known many Morgans both male and female. I've even run across a few unscrupulous business people who question if I am really Morgan (generally for credit cards, banks), however while they sound skeptical and ask more then the typical security questions, never, and I mean never, have I been so horrified and embarrassed as I was in this Starbucks. Nor have I ever met someone quite so ignorant and rude. The other day, I went into the Starbucks with clients and when I handed my card to the cashier, he asked if 'he' was with me. When I replied `"he?`" the cashier continued to look around us (a group of females) and ask where was `"he, Morgan`". Apparently 'he' needed to be around to show his ID. My jaw dropped! I replied that I am Morgan to which he looked at me skeptically, sighed, then brashly stated that I needed to show him my ID. Last I knew the appropriate way to handle this situation would have been to politely ask for my ID, not to assume (ignorantly so, mind you) that I am not the person on the card because, well, Morgan must be a male only name! More over, once he knew that I was in fact Morgan, being rude beyond that point was just uncalled for and unprofessional on so many levels. Worst yet, he never apologized, you would think for that much he would have. Nope, nothing. It certainly left a lasting imprint on my clients which had a few (mind you highly embarrassing) chuckles at my expense. Thanks for the laugh. Guess I'll find somewhere else to waste my money.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jan 8, 2015~This particular Starbucks offers super quick service, delightful employees, and my coffee is outstanding.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Nov 2, 2015~This location just doesn't have it together.  10 minutes sitting at the window after ordering just a regular drip coffee.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Oct 8, 2014~Hey Starbucks Fans,Wanna make sure you waste time in the morning?Wanna experience bad customer service at .....of all places , a Starbucks?It's almost impossible to get bad customer service at a Starbuck's, right?EXCEPT HERE!Oct. 8th, 2014 approximately 5am  and in a rush to get to work.Get my Venti pike through the drive thru.Half way down the road, drink and spit....coffee grounds and tastes like it was burnt.Drive all the way back.Tell them the problem and ask to have it remade.All done without a smile and then,,, and then ...a huddle of about 4-5 barista's form near the drive thru window and I get several hard eyes and especially a long stare from the girl that made my drink.The male barista that remade my drink was unfriendly and unapologetic.He practically threw the drink on the counter and hurriedly walked away I then said: `"hey, what about my free drink coupon`"? `"you know, the one that you give out when an order is screwed up/`"The barista said I should be happy because they just remade my drink.I WASN'T HAPPY!He said he would get his manager, AMANDA.If you want someone to put you in a bad mood, just talk to sour puss AMANDA.I don't think she is a real manager, but a supervisor of some sorts.Supposedly this store was operating with no manager that day because MIGUEL had the day off.AMANDA was so sour looking, so unhappy looking and obviously had not been trained properly.I said I wanted my FREE DRINK coupon.She said no.I said: `"ummmm, well, what are the free drink coupons for then?`"She said they are for when a customer is unhappy with heir drink or order.I informed her I wasn't happy.She said sorry, but we already remade your drink and now that's all they can do.THINK ABOUT IT: you got your drink, it was screwed up....you drove 10 minutes putting me around 35th give or take and then turn around and drive back to 67th....are you going to be happy just to have the drink remade? Ummm isn't that how your drink should have been in the first place?NO!You are only going to be made WHOLE if they compensate for your time, for your gas, for being late to work, for the aggravation, right?SO, IF YOU WANT HORRIBLE, UNFRIENDLY, UNTRAINED STARBUCK BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE....YOU GO TO THE STARBUCKS AT 67TH AND PEORIA IN GLENDALE, AZ.....GUARANTEED TO RUIN YOUR DAY AND LEAVE YOU OUT OF POCKET!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 18, 2016~The first time I went I was ignored for 10 minutes and I just walked away, decided that everybody deserves a second chance and went again worst mistake the second time I was totally ignore and the barista made everybody but my drink the manager was rude and said I couldn't get a refund because I didn't have a receipt and no way to prove I order something the cashier remembered me but not my order and since he was just a cashier there was nothing he can do never again I will drink at Starbucks I rather go somewhere else any recommendations anybody (no Starbucks please)
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Mar 21, 2018~Because Michael at the drive through is freaking awesome!! Even if they run out of matcha he always is so nice and bubbly makes up for anything! Michael makes Starbucks at this location!!!!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 19, 2017~Worst Starbucks location. Drive through is faster than going inside. Waited 30 minutes for one drink. They mess up and aren't apologetic. Like it's your fault they didn't get it right. Drinks constantly made wrong. They had a new girl working register which is fine but she was so soft spoken she sounded like she was whispering. Get it together.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Feb 24, 2018~This Starbucks location has improved 150%!   Baristas are friendly and want to complete order to customers' satisfaction. When ordering online orders are hot &amp; ready when I arrive. Glad I gave this location another chance. They help start my day in fine fashion.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Oct 15, 2016~Very disappointed in this location in the last month (maybe new management?). Wait times are 20+ minutes and not sure how they prioritize orders. Last week I had a mobile order, and they didn't start making it until 10 minutes after I arrived. Today, very crowded at 11:30 a.m., ordering inside went quickly, but 9 people who ordered after me were served before I received my order. I asked if they'd forgotten my order. I was told, `"You're next`" only to have 3 orders served before mine. This store used to have very quick response on orders, &amp; friendly staff. Now the staff seems bothered by customers. Time to find a new Starbucks.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Jun 11, 2014~Decent customer service, messed up my drive thru orders a couple of times but we're only human right? I would go around and get my order corrected but customer service is tooo slowww. On average I wait 8-12mins in the drive thru with only 2 cars ahead of me. That's way too long on a consistent basis. The staff needs to take a few shots of espresso and pick up the pace! I believe it's the way they pipe line their orders which isn't very efficient, a new system is needed. They renovated the inside which is nicer now though.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 30, 2014~One of my least favorite Starbucks anywhere . . . Recently remodeled indoor seating is unattractive and crowded . . . Very few of the baristas here are friendly (there are a couple of great employees, for sure) . . . Heaven help you if you arrive in the morning when there's a line . . .
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jan 3, 2020~messed up my order twice. wrong drink then gave me the wrong size and never recharged me. very disappointing.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Nov 27, 2013~Been through this drive thru twice.  Both times order was messed up.  And they don't really seem to care. Very frustrating
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Apr 30, 2015~Whether you go in or use the drive thru, the baristas at this Starbucks location are friendly, efficient, and they are excellent at learning cutomer names and drink choices. They are so good, in fact, that they recognize my voice in the drive thru so I don't even have to order that much anymore - they instead rattle my coffee choice off to me - which is not that easy either `"Venti Cafe Vanilla Frappaccino with 3 shots Vanilla, 2 Shots espresso, with nonfat milk and whipped cream,`" yet they somehow remember and ALWAYS get right. Which is amazing to me considering how many customers blow through there on a day-to-day basis.
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Sep 21, 2011~I stopped by Starbucks this morning, and decided to try something new, the baristas there had an `"employee favorite`".. the London Fog. If you like vanilla or lavender tastes, than you will love this drink, i sure did, it's a tea latte and delicious.The drive thru starbucks on Peoria Ave &amp; 67th is definitely worth parking, going inside, and getting something off of the underground menu.  I have officially converted over from my usual caramel frappuccino, and the baristas at this starbucks know what tastes good.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Jun 30, 2017~This was the dirtiest Starbucks I've ever been to and one of the slowest. However staff was friendly and my drink was yummy.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jul 7, 2010~This is my FAVORITE Starbucks! The people are great! Management is great! Love this place!
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Jul 26, 2014~A typical Starbucks.  This one has panty of power outlets though and is a great place to study if you are a student looking for free WiFi.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 5, 2017~I did my order online and when I got there to pick up my drink the inside was closed.  I called them to see if there was another way to get my drink other than waiting in their horrendously long drive thru line and they said no,  but they would not add the ice to my drink until I got to the window... so I waited and waited finally got to the window and they tried to give me someone else's drink.   Then they asked me what I got and I told them but apparently they didn't have my order because I had to show them my order from my phone so they could remake it.   It was still not made correctly. Also I am playing their online game and was not given credit for this order (or the last one).  All around bad experience.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jan 16, 2014~My go to Starbucks almost every morning! Everyone is always so friendly and my drinks are always delish! I'm not sure why other reviews say this drive thru is slow, I'm almost always in and out of there, considering it's early morning and hello ... It's Starbucks, everyone loves it so of course it's going to be busy. But in my experience it's always been pretty efficient in the drive thru!
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Feb 3, 2014~No longer my favorite Starbucks. Horrible customer service. Received bad service twice in 4 days. Apparently it is so hard to smile. Girl at the drive through really did not seem to care. Decided to go inside for once and they forgot my drink. The girl did not write it down, and seemed more interested in talking with her friend then helping me. Don't see myself coming back.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Mar 27, 2016~Although everybody knows how over priced is starbucks its seems like you have to pay extra to have a good customer service. It has become an unfortunate trend for me that every time I go to this location,  the cashier has only two interactions with me : `"anything else`" and `"total is $X. XX`". I will always order the same product,  Grande Americano with 4 raw sugar packages; however my wife and kids will try to discover new stuff almost on every visit. The cashiers rush people to complete their order,  and would roll their eyes if questioned about what's in every drink. Where is the good old customer service? I'm a man in my forties therefor I don't expect anyone to kiss my rear end,  I just want a nice and polite attitude in exchange for my well earned money. Starbucks should have higher standards in customer service,  and hold themselves accountable for their employees. If all I wanted was coffee,  I could of go to any circle K and get the same lackluster customer service.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Oct 23, 2015~Went thru the drive thru once, messed up a drink and accused of ordering a drink that they made wrong. I walked in and nicely offered to give my drink instructions again and this catty person picked up the phone. Here's a new flash, this is a $5 drink, get it right and be nice about it. And I spent a total of $10 that visit. You guys are forgetting that these drinks pays for your salary and I am a gold member. Also, as a practice, when a customer is upset, don't bribe them with a free drink right away, show some empathy and make it right / some of us don't want a free drink; I want good cud other service and drink made the right way.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Nov 4, 2016~This Starbucks needs a lot of help. Customers services is very bad. Everyone there are always in a bad mood, like if they don't want to be there? Here's a tip, if you don't like your job, work somewhere else. My mom came the other day and she received the worst service ever. She ordered her drink before these two gentlemen but somehow they got their drinks before her? Not only she got her drink late but she also got her drink messed up. When she ask this blonde hair girl for a remake, she completely ignored her. My mom felt really uncomfortable being there since she thought it was because of her race, the employees didn't want to help her out and just ignore her. I thought my mom was being overreacting so I told her, let's give this place another try, and we did. The services was still bad, I got a weird vibe that employees didn't want us to be there, due to all the dirty looks we got when we were walking in, but as soon someone else (not asian) came in, they got smiles and a nice greeting? I don't want to bring in race into this, but this is unbelievable. This place needs new management and better employees.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Aug 2, 2016~The slowest Starbucks I have ever been to, plan on spending 15-20+ in the drive through
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 6, 2014~We have tried this Starbucks numerous times as it is the closest one to our house. EVERY SINGLE TIME OUR ORDER IS WRONG. Everytime. I am okay if it happens here and there because we are all human an make mistakes, but I just don't think the people at this location care. Even after going inside to have it corrected the service was terrible and extremely slow. We will be going to the location on 83rd and Union Hills. Always friendly there and have never had a messed up drink. Oh and I don't order anything complicated. Just a basic white chocolate mocha. How hard is it to make??
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~May 1, 2015~i dont like going to this one unless I am in a hurry..  Two days ago they were out of lime refresher.. Yesterday and today they were out of the breakfst sandwich I wanted.. this is annoying as I go specifically for that item .. Today I wasnt told they didnt have it until I reached the window , had paid then they tell me.. They did substitute but that is bad customer service and i know they are really busy in the morning but still.. I hate driving way out of my way when this is so close and convenient but I may be forced to do so if they cant stock the right items..
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Dec 28, 2015~Bad Customer Service.  Stop by on Christmas Day and service was terrible. Brandon cocked an attitude when I polity informed him. He messed up my order with the order behind me and had to redo both. Perhaps if Mr. personality would pay attention to what he is doing and NOT trying to be a social butterfly to his regular customer this would NEVER happen!  Where's the manager and why is he still here? Must be good at something but not making drinks at Starbucks.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 12, 2016~If I could I'd give ZERO for customer service. I waited at the window for 10 minutes(not including the extra 15 in the drive through line) for a simple shaken tea! A little ridiculous when the teas are pre made in a pitcher.  They are constantly out of supplies and never offer something similar. They just continue to say `" No we don't have any of this or that`"... Gee thanks. I will make sure I avoid this Starbucks going forward.
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Aug 16, 2016~The worst Starbucks I have ever been too...customer service is terrible. I was helped by Len today and he is the rudest, miserable employee at that location. He remade my drink 3 times, clearly was not listening to me and when I tried to explain to him what I wanted he treated me like a child and was over the top rude. Only after I asked him for his name did he change it up and sarcastically wish me a good day. I ended up walking into the store after already waiting in the drive thru line and another employee remade my drink exactly how I asked it be made and she thankfully was so nice...watch out for Len
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jul 18, 2016~I have found this to be the worst starbucks around. They are consistently slow and constantly get orders wrong. This is not just once or twice but has happened at least 6-7 times in the past year. This wouldn't happen in Seattle, it wouldn't be tolerated! I don't understand the help situation, other shops don't seem to have this problem, it may be the reason why Dutch Bros lines go around their building, they are trained properly!!
Glendale, AZ 85302~3~Oct 11, 2013~3 stars cause they get my drink right every time, minus 2 stars cause the Wi-Fi is horribly slow, Burger King across the street is 69% faster... did some calculations to figure that out...
Glendale, AZ 85302~2~Feb 5, 2011~Terrible service! The cashier was rude and not as friendly as other Starbucks employees. My drink was completely forgotten about; I had to go up and remind them after 30 minutes of waiting. These girls need to be retrained.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Oct 20, 2014~I had the WORST experience!!! I have never been disregarded or ignored in a Starbucks my entire life. Just last week, I said nothing but good things to other people and now I wouldn't recommend to anyone!! When my husband and I arrive, there seems to be a meeting with staff or management.  The one of the baristas had just finished taking an order when we walked in, then started doing possible prep. We can understand that because my husband wasn't sure as to what he wanted to order. Once we knew what we wanted we walked to the front of the register. And waited more. I became HEATED when someone walked in after we had been waiting for almost 10 minutes, and the barista quickly ran to help the person that came in after we did!!! Is my money not green? I thought it was even worse that the meeting with Starbucks personnel was sitting right there!!! Is this a normal thing? Rudeness to customers in front of possible management? This tells me that it must be a normal occurrence!! Thank you for that because now it made me go to It's A Grind!!!
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jul 5, 2016~I absolutely LOVE this location.  Despite the fact that it does get busy and sometimes the drive thru line is wicked long, the employees are always uber friendly!  I am from a small town where everyone knows your name and remembers your `"usual`" order.  Even though hundreds of different people filter through this Starbucks daily, whenever I walk in, I am greeted and asked if I want the usual.  Even other customers will spring up a conversation, which is nice to see that not everyone is infactuated with themselves or their technology.  As I sit in this Starbucks writing this review, an older gentleman walked in and was greeted by three different employees by name, all asking how his day was and if the drink was for his wife.  Just sitting back and watching this experience made it feel as though I was back in my small town - I felt at home.  You may not get this same experience if you continuously go through the drive thru.  Spend some time inside to get to know the employees and they will get to know you too!  Take some time to smell the coffee once in a while!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Jun 15, 2016~Let me start by saying I only go to this Starbucks because it is right around the corner from my house. When I have time, I will drive to a different location. I usually get serviced through the drive-thru. I do not know if it is due to management or ownership but year after year I am disappointed with this Starbucks about 85% of the time. First of all, service is Super Slow at best snail speed. Secondly, they are always low or out of Matcha Green tea which is what I order. If I am lucky they will tell me so upon ordering. If I am unlucky they will tell me so after I have paid just so they could refund me! Forget getting a drink compensated for their mistake-it will never happen. And if your refunded, try getting a receipt- they have refused me one twice now. Lastly, no one has that friendly personality that I come to look forward to when buying my drinks there.  Maybe it's me but I am someone who looks for the customer experience. Sorry to say that it is lacking here.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Feb 25, 2022~Even though this Starbucks has no indoor seating, I rank it top 10 SB in Phoenix because of the outstanding staff. Joseph and Billy are 2 of the best Baristas I've ever met....well done guys. They're always professional, friendly, accurate with orders providing the best customer service.It perks up my day more than the caffeine which from me is a huge compliment : )
Phoenix, AZ 85028~4~Dec 5, 2021~This is a very convenient Starbucks on Shea just West of Tatum. I bicycled there from another Starbucks on 32nd and Shea. It is only drive thru, so I subtract a star(there are toilets available for customers however).The Baristas were very professional and friendly.There is also some nice, outdoor patio seating.Recommended above average SB location.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Sep 28, 2024~Horrible customer service. Arrived in the drive through at 5:50pm on a Saturday. They close at 6pm but 10 minutes should be enough time to still order a drink and leave before 6pm. Wait for 2 minutes at the speaker, no one says anything. Pull up to the window to give the girl working our order, she then tells us they are closed. We ask, aren't you open until 6pm. All signs, app, maps say they are open until 6pm. She informs us that no, they close at 5:30pm. My wife suggests they should probably change their signs then, at which point the employee starts getting nasty and saying they are allowed to close early and it was just for that day. Again my wife suggests even a temporary sign letting customers know they were closing early that day and to have a good day. As we drive away the employee leans out the window and continues to shout as we are driving away. Will definitely not be going back to this Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Apr 6, 2024~The worst customer service ever! The guy at the window straight up lied to me, saying they couldn't do a decaf pour-over because they didn't have the beans... but they could do a decaf americano.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Feb 21, 2023~Sweetest people ever. They're fast and efficient. I love coming here, best way to start the day. Order ahead it will save you time!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Sep 7, 2022~Great coffee and a friendly staff , always willing to serve you .they do welcome you as a great friend and part of their family
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Oct 12, 2021~I love it at this location, cute environment and nice workers! I would come back again
Phoenix, AZ 85028~3~Feb 24, 2021~I was craving a spinach feta wrap. I stopped by the Starbucks on 107 n Shea. They didn't have it, I left. I planned to go to one of the other 10 Starbucks on Shea Blvd. I settled on the Starbucks drive thru off Tatum n Shea. When I pull up to the window, of course, no spinach feta wrap. My luck recently. I settled for a bacon / sausage wrap. Underwhelming - The coffee never disappoints though
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~May 3, 2021~They've gotten worse :( So frustrating. I do my mobile order 15 min or longer before arriving and still have to wait almost 10 min at walk up window. Makes zero sense. I give up.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Feb 26, 2020~Somehow this walk up/drive thru only location managed to ruin the best thing about Starbucks. They are ALWAYS super slow with mobile order pickup. I think they need more baristas? Also most of the staff is super rude. We know it's early but would it kill you to smile? Definitely an anomaly compared to any other Starbucks I've been to. I will continue to go here only because it's the only one I pass on my way to work but have gone back to doing drive thru as they seem to care more about making those drinks. Ps the older blonde woman at the drive up is the best employee there. Hopefully someone goes in and fixes the situation here.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Jan 7, 2021~Just wanted to give a shout out to HOLLY at this location that has absolutely AWESOME customer service skills.She went above and beyond to help me out when I had a problem with an order......and her attitude and pleasant demeanor meant SO MUCH right now (in this apathetic dull world:))Thanks Holly!   You have STAR qualities and I really appreciated it!!Great customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Jul 18, 2018~This place has NO seating area inside, it's ONLY a DRIVE THRU and WALK UP &amp; ORDER Starbucks. I didn't know that was a thing.. but I still love the customer service, and the accuracy of my order I get every time I come here! I use the drive thru frequently, and have tried the `"walk thru`" they have a nice patio to sit at with misters.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~4~May 19, 2020~Location is only doing Drive-Thru or Mobile Pickup options due to Corona virus. I definitely recommend doing the mobile order, based on when I arrived at 10:30am and the line was pretty long (see pictures). Overall, staff is nice, only giving 4 stars based on wait time for 2 drinks via mobile order.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Oct 17, 2020~It appears that drive through takes priority as I waited 20+ minutes for 4 drinks at the walk up window. This is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to across the entire country!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Jan 21, 2022~Every time i use this Starbucks I am delighted at the taste of their espresso!  It is so nutty and smooth, no bitterness whatsoever!  They pull of the shot is everything!   Yummy.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Aug 18, 2021~Corporate really needs to address an attitude problem with the front window staff.  A complaint to management was just as bad.  Corporate really needs to do a retraining at this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~May 23, 2020~I walked 2 miles to Starbucks this morning to get my coffee. As I tried to place my mobile order, the worker opened the window and said, `"We can't take mobile orders right now - the system is down. Drive-thru only.`" I tried to tell her that I had just walked 2 miles over there and obviously had no car. She shrugged and said, `"Sorry. We can't take walk-up orders.`" I said, `"So... you can open the window to talk to me, but you can't open the window to take my order?`" She shrugged again. I go to this Starbucks EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. $5 x 365 = $2000 they just lost. Because I will not be back. Things they could have done:- Taken my order and put it through the drive through processing and then simply handed me my drink through the walk-up window. - Given me a free drink coupon. - Made me a drink and given it to me for free (forget about the whole ordering system). Instead, they just lost a customer. Especially these days, businesses should be treating their customers LIKE GOLD. Because we are.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Dec 13, 2017~This drive-thru Starbucks location is great! I have been here several times both in the drive-thru and at the counter and service is friendly and fast both ways. Although this is just a drive-thru location, there is a fairly large covered seating area outdoors as well as a family bathroom. Additionally, they carry a very small collection of some Starbucks merchandise (Christmas ornaments and other small things) in case you're ever in a huge crunch to get something. They also sell major newspapers.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Oct 17, 2020~Worst Starbucks ever !!! I don't know who the hell was this old lady !! Went to pick up my order HORRIBLE I ORDERED A STARBUCKS DOUBLE SHOT ON ICE AND she added Hazel nut to my coffee i didn't returned because it was a long as line !! But worse attitude why the hell you work  if you are going to have the kind of attitude!! I love Starbucks but i guess I'm just wasting my money when they don't do my coffee the way i like it !! In the case i will just start going to McDonald's and get the same coffee but cheaper !! This place doesn't even deserve a star so so sad
Phoenix, AZ 85028~4~Dec 21, 2017~This drive thru location is great. 1) There is never a long wait, 2) the staff are super friendly and helpful3) they've never messed up my order.I've never eaten outside or gone inside, but there is a cute seating area outside and I always see people sitting out there.The ONLY thing stopping them from receiving 5 stars from me is the challenge leaving the parking lot to turn back west on Shea. There's no wait in the drive thru, but there's like 4-5 cars deep waiting to exit the lot to turn onto Shea. Ugh. It sure would be nice if there was a back alley to get you to the 40th St and Shea stop light quickly.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Aug 20, 2020~This Starbucks used to be one of my favorite locations... But ever since Covid they've decided to let customer service go out the window. I understand safety; as a medical professional I am well aware of the CDC guidelines. But allowing a car to sit at the drive-through window for minutes while there is a line of people waiting to go to work is just ridiculous. Have the car pull up and walk them out their drink with the mask on. It's not considerate nor good business practice to make everyone else wait. In addition, there have been several times when I have placed a mobile order for this location only to find out that they have closed early or opened late. It's really a shame.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Mar 6, 2018~I go to this Starbucks all the time! I absolutely love the guy who runs the drive-through window during the day! I'm not quite sure what his name is but he has curly light brown hair and it's usually worn in a ponytail! He is always so friendly and genuine! They are usually pretty fast in their drive-through and if not it's the customers' fault, not theirs! The only negative thing I have to say is that their location is a pain to get in and out of because of the traffic on Shea! Other than that this is a great Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Feb 19, 2020~This has to be the worst Starbucks I have ever visited. EVER. Waited in the drive thru line for at least 25 minutes- I promise you, this is not one of those first world problem exaggerations. And there's no escape because of the strategically placed curb and landscaping. I could have possibly overlooked the stolen minutes from my life if they had actually handed me a drink that was palatable and I had not wasted my money in addition to my time. My mother suggested I go back and have them remake the drink, which was NOT complicated in the first place, and apparently the look on my face conveyed exactly what I was thinking and she said nothing more. I will never go back to this establishment again and they are an embarrassment to the franchise name.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Jun 26, 2015~The new drive thru location is now open! Right off of Tatum and Shea! Beautiful location, that's got a great outside seating area with misters! So happy that there's finally a drive thru location on my way too work. This isn't a location that has an inside seating area but that's ok, there's a few others around that do offer that. Today was there official opening day and to say I got my drink and food quickly and efficiently. So excited to make this location my new regular stop!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Jan 8, 2017~I am a regular Starbucks customer. We just moved and this is now the closest location to us. Ugh!! They have never gotten our order correct one time. We have been here at least eight times now, so that's a fair chance to get it right. This last time, this is how much coffee was in my cup after the whipped cream melted!  I don't want to drive extra, but I guess that hassle is better than dealing with any more garbage from this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~May 5, 2020~I actually would give any stars to this location.... F*&amp;!@ this location. Liz was a total biatch with her lack of service today 5/5/2020 12:46 p.m. I asked for my drink plus my FREE TEA REFILL like I do every time I  order. She said we don't do that here. I told her fine, I'll call corporate as I have done in the past. Every Time I call corporate they always tell me yes that is part of the protocol. I can get a free refill at the same time since most stores are closed during this since the Covid-crap.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Oct 21, 2020~Everytime I've gone they've messed up my drink... I got a Mocha cookie crumble today and it tasted like crushed up cigarettes. I've gotten the same drink at multiple other places and it's always been good. TRAIN YOUR BARISTAS BETTER.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Mar 25, 2016~Positives: 1- the drive thru moves quickly even when you think `"no way am I waiting in that line!`"2- the location is easy to access and leave such that even in horrible rush hour, you can get in and out of the lotNegatives:1- I come EVERY day and order the EXACT same thing. No one remembers me. EVER. 2- I constantly have to restate my order to get it entered correctly and I would think this is my fault but I don't have this issue at other locations3- don't bother trying to use the walk up to beat the drive thru line. Soooooooo sloooooow. 4- twice recently they have given me the wrong drink and I haven't noticed and needed to go to a SECOND Starbucks to get a corrected order. 5- finally, some of the staff annoys me!  I don't want to talk about the details of weekend plans on  630am on a Friday. A simple `"hi, how are you, here's your correct order`" will do...
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~May 9, 2019~First...getting in and out of this Starbucks is a nightmare due to traffic on Shea. The lady at the window was rude to me and her co-workers. The frappes were made sloppy. I asked for no whip and they put whip on them. They just scraped the whip off, rinsed the cups and gave them to me dripping.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Jul 19, 2017~This Starbucks is probably my favorite location, the drive thru moves super fast and the baristas running the drive-thru have always been so friendly, like shockingly friendly. I don't come here often because it's expensive and well.. it's big chain Starbucks, but when I really need some caffeine or didn't get a chance to grab something for breakfast this location has always been very convenient, in and out, and the drinks/food are made really well.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~4~Dec 11, 2015~Great location! Love the outside eating area. Got my drink fast, friendly staff, and will come here again!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~3~Jan 3, 2018~Annoyed by this `"drive thru`" location. A friend and I made plans to meet for a coffee and chat, this Starbucks was closest so we decided to go here. Neither of us knew it was drive thru ONLY. Get there and realize that we can't go inside okay so we'll sit on the patio. Except the outside window on the patio is closed and you have to go through the drive-thru to get a drink. Looks like we're going elsewhere.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Dec 8, 2017~This place is mediocre, sad to see corporate let a location sink so low. To be fair it's management and their training standards. If you want a sloppy cup of coffee this is the place to come, they make the drinks blindfolded here and just hand them out to move their line. Next time I need Starbucks I'll just head over to another location or Dutch Bros.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~May 28, 2020~Not customer friendly.  No trucks. No walk ups.  They suck!  Slow lines.  Snow flakes must be running this place!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Dec 20, 2016~worst customer service , I usually happy with starbucks very nice batista everywhere except this place , now I understand why it's always empty.next time I will drive the extra mile .
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Dec 7, 2017~Love that this is a fast convenient location to me in my way to work! They always give my fur baby a pupa-chino as well!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Jan 19, 2019~I ordered coffee in the drive thru, and asked for any blend that wasn't Pike Place, but they only had pike place on. I ordered a blonde roast pour over instead. By the time I got to the window they `"had my pour over ready.`" (This is impossible, pour over takes at least 3-4 minutes, and it only took me 30 seconds to get to the window.) They clearly just gave me pike place because they were too lazy to make my drink and thought I was too dumb to notice. Extremely disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Sep 22, 2020~Doesn't even deserve one star. I was just at this location. And the girl at the drive thru had the worst attitude I've ever seen. She had dark brown hair in a ponytail I didn't see her name tag. But I got to the the speaker to order and she said `"what do you want`" in a rude tone. I ordered then got up to the window and I said `"hi how are you?`" She ignored me and snatched my card out of my hand. Then I asked for a straw and she rolled her eyes and didn't say a single word to me. While I grabbed my card and the straw she was holding the drink out the window tipping it to the side and bouncing her hand up and down. Like can you not wait a second for me to put my card away? Now my drink cup is all sticky because she tipped it and bounced it around. And i just said thank you and she looked at me blankly and closed the window. Now I don't normally write bad reviews but I had to write this one. I will never return to this location again after this incident. And this isn't the first time I've had a rude `"barista`" at this location. I'd highly suggest Starbucks stops hiring bratty 16 year old girls.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Aug 25, 2015~I'm still in shock. I just watched the barista drop my cup on the ground, pick it back up, and make my coffee. Disgusted! Taking this all the way to the top!!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Oct 12, 2017~Worst customer service!!!  Because THEY messed up on my order in the drive thru, they made me park the car and stand in line that had 6 people in it just to get my drink. I thought the whole idea of using the drive-thru was not to get out of your car?!?!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Aug 21, 2015~Fast workers , great personalities and amazing service . I leave happy every time  =]
Phoenix, AZ 85028~4~Mar 12, 2016~I have picked up my morning coffee this drive thru location.  They got my order very quickly. I could give to them 5 stars but unfortunately they didn't have lemonade for you order one morning.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Aug 21, 2015~This is a new location for Starbucks, and I was as excited about it opening as others, but extremely disappointed in my mocha frap. I have had these same fraps at a number of locations and this is the first that the mocha frap has tasted like ice water and a splash of coffee.  I felt like I was at this other location called bosa donuts. At least there you pay $4 for a coffee and get what you pay for. Here, (@ Starbucks) when you pay the amount, you expect the best. This was extremely disappointing. I'll stick to Tempe and other established Starbucks coffee houses.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~4~Oct 20, 2024~Yes - it's a Starbucks...And yes - it's in a grocery store, but sometimes when you're on the run, you want something consistent and fast, and this Starbucks fits the bill!I only had 10 minutes in between a couple of stops with my kids and this location was close... Since it's located inside Fry's, you can pick up any miscellaneous groceries at the same time.Since I was here last, this Starbucks blew up! It was formerly more of a kiosk and small location, but now it is almost like a full service store that has everything including plenty of seating.Service is friendly and fast and every product I had was consistent. They were out of the birthday cake cake pops during my visit, but all good... We will have to try cookies and cream as an alternative this time! When I'm on the go, the egg white bites are always a perfect breakfast item or snack. Coffee is fine and I like  an occasional iced tea with lemonade too.While I prefer to support local coffee shops, it's nice to have Starbucks close by pretty much anywhere you go and this location is no exception. Enjoy!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Aug 25, 2023~Guys this Starbucks just had a full remodel and it's absolutely stunning! Amanda was my barista today she was a ray of sunshine and very helpful. Go and check out this newly remodeled location, it will not disappoint. Fancy Fry's Starbucks for the win!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Aug 26, 2023~First made my friends pumpkin spice frap a latte then once he remade the drink was asking if it was supposed to have whipped cream on it and if it was supposed to have cinnamon and STILL made the frappuccino wrong. Then once joshua made my apple crisp macchiato, he asked if he was supposed to mix it because he added the drink together wrong. Once i got my drink, i noticed that he forgot the steamed milk and the apple crisp drizzle i asked him to just add it at the top and instead he made pumpkin spice cold foam and asked me if that was okay and i was just so done with this that i said it was fine (may I include he AGAIN forgot the apple crisp drizzle). Next I saw him make another customers drink wrong by making her pumpkin spice chai latte a pumpkin spice latte. (UPDATE) I called and asked for his managers number to talk to him about this and he gave me a number that is not real and then once i tried to call back he let it ring for five minutes (or longer) until he picked it up and put it back down making the call end. I went back about 2 hours later and there were two super nice workers and they told me that there were already a couple reports about him and they were figuring it out. if you get joshua DO NOT ORDER he is very rude and will not make your drink right
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~May 29, 2023~Stopped by here in the morning to grab a quick bite, while I was giving the lady my order she kept cutting me off before I was done talking &amp; practically rushing me to tell her what I wanted.... Once getting to the window I payed but I could tell she had a major attitude. My drinks were rushly made and I could tell by the quality, my breakfast sandwich was also a part in the bag, these people clearly don't want to work here and be of service and it shows! I just want my food made with love! Won't be coming here again
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Mar 20, 2021~So let's just start out that they were a line from the window about 5 deep and about 20 cars deep on the drive thru. I chose to walk up (there is no inside area what so ever at this location) most of us had gotten out of the drive line due to it being very long. We all get up there and one by one.............. they let us try and order then told us it's only pick up and no more ordering....? THERE IS NO INSIDE HOW CAN WE NOT WALK UP AND ORDER?! Plus there is no sign stating anything. Like I said earlier we ALL got out of line to walk up. 10 cars get through the line before I'm told even though We were waiting the entire time we have to get back in line if I wanted to order and didn't have a pick up. So they feel safe enough to give pick ups there product but not safe enough to swipe a card?! Asinine. So ya after all this I ended up getting my drinks 40 minutes after I pulled in. Also.. get a nicer personality if you are going to deliberately waste the customers time with this window debacle.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~3~Jul 11, 2015~I liked the ambiance very much.I would like to visit this Starbucks again for few more visits and share with friendsI would suggest if they play some light music in background instead of the boring TV show noice.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Sep 12, 2013~Great FAST location inside Fry's Market. This Fry's has everything! Friendly staff and great seating, inside and out!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Oct 6, 2016~I am a gold card member.  Policy is refills on same day.  I asked the gal at the window and she said `"same day same visit`".  She said `"not all Starbucks follow Starbucks policies`".  Good thing a Company this large has policies.Will NOT go back to this Starbucks EVER.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~3~Mar 10, 2015~Pretty disappointed in this location. I go there in the morning before work and there is an older lady who can NEVER get my order right. I have had to repeat it multiple times and it is very frustrating that I have repeated it so many times and it is till wrong.  I have been patient with her thinking maybe she is new but I have been going there a few months now. The other staff members have been great and it seems they are getting frustrated with her as well. I guess it is time to try another Starbucks location. Sorry other Starbucks staff but it seems your fellow employee is holding you back.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~5~May 26, 2023~I ordered the white chocolate macadamia cream cold brew. Rafael suggested an extra pump of the macadamia syrup since I like things on the sweeter side. His recommendation was so great. My drink is DELICIOUS. Customer service was absolutely amazing as well. This Starbucks deserves every single star I gave it. 10/10 starbies location.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~2~Aug 3, 2019~Great cold brew and food, but sad service. I placed a mobile order, three team members were behind the counter, it was busy and I waited for my estimate of 4-7 minutes. After the rush cleared ou, within 4 minutes  it was 7 minutes and I still hadn't received my order. One guy was making and serving all the orders, he still hadn't made it to my mobile order.Instead of being helpful team members when it slowed down and getting my food and cold brew out of the way for him which doesnt even come from the espresso bar area, his teammates talk, take the trash and completely ignore it.So disappointed in how they help out their team members.....just put it all on one guy.
Phoenix, AZ 85050~1~Apr 14, 2021~I bought a breakfast sandwich this morning and it is cold! You can't serve food that has dairy and egg that has been sitting out for an extended amount of time. I couldn't go back to get the problem fixed because I had to go to work but this was disgusting!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~May 30, 2021~We were walking around the second floor Housewares section at Macy's and we were absolutely dumbfounded and flabbergasted when we started to smelled coffee. Where was it coming from?  Was their coffee maker display somewhere?  Did someone spill coffee somewhere?  No!  This Macy's actually has a mini-kiosk with a Barista.  Hey, it came in very handy since we were tired of shopping for things for our new house. This is your standard Starbucks setup and they accept your scan-card or iPhone App. The shortcoming is there is only two seats.  But this was a wonderful surprise, so thank you Macy's for thinking outside the, er box.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Dec 18, 2019~This location is cool. Closes a bit early, but if you make it in time and want coffee, it's a convenient stop on the upper level of Macy's in the housewares section.I've gotten coffee here twice. Staff can be a little green but very sweet.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Dec 22, 2018~Small kiosk in most crowded place you can imagine. So all the time there will be a queue to order and to get your order as well. But Mandatory coffee of the day so had to take after watching aquaman in AMC. And it's worth it if you are shopping. Grab in hand and pass your time while you shop everywhere.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 9, 2022~I am so upset and I am normally a pretty reasonable person because I work in customer service industry too. First, I had to look for them inside the mall and they are tucked inside 2nd floor inside of Macy's by the bedroom section. I had to ask around and then it was 7:15pm and they close at 8pm but they wont make my frappuccino because they were `"already cleaning the kitchen`". I needed one more frapp purchase to complete my bonus stars challenge and today is the last day but they still said no... so I had to drive out of the mall to the nearest starbucks because they refuse to make my drink when they had 45mins left before they actually close.. Thats such a bad customer service! I get it if its 10mins before close but 45mins before close?! Ridiculous!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 9, 2022~Refused to make my wife's drink because she arrived a couple minutes before closing. Smh! Mall location inside macys. Terrible customer service
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 6, 2020~Masks are clearly not required here.  Shame on your management.  185k Americans dead and countless businesses destroyed.  Do your part.  Require masks.  Protect your workers and patrons!  I will not be coming back.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 12, 2019~Great location super busy but awesome staff. The store manager is awesome works hard and creates a good environment . All the staff is friendly for the most part and always ask me questions about my day. Yes it's busy but they do a great job .
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Dec 26, 2018~Took 40 minutes for 1 grande iced caramel macchiato  people behind us are getting there drinks and we are still waiting
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Feb 22, 2021~Wow- at the moment this location has 2.5 stars?! I'm pretty shocked. I've been coming to this location since it opened. I used to go between this Starbucks and the one on 67th &amp; 101 (pretty much right around the corner), but the fact that 67th doesn't have a drive thru I've been frequenting this location for a while now. Even though I usually hit their drive-thru there have been times when I've been inside. As for the service, it is wonderful. The staff is always upbeat, friendly and personable. It actually feels so good to leave here with a smile on your face with all the craziness 2020-2021 has put us all through. The drinks and food are usually great. In the beginning when they opened there were a few hiccups with their black iced coffee-but for a long time now everything has been on point with taste and quality. Here's the reason this isn't a 5-star review:I'm a *nice coffee snob from NY (#owningit, I also said nice :) ). So I don't mind drinking my coffee black. I actually enjoy it and prefer it that way most times. (We do have souls I promise). On occasion I like to order it with a splash of either coconut milk or almond milk. Contrary to what I would think, there is no universal barista language where `"splash`" is a consistent measurement. I did Google it and found nothing. So I guess in NY we expect a splash of coffee being like a dash or a drop? Usually the coffee results in a dark brown color. Yet ordering coffee here it's more like milk with a splash of coffee; way too light in color. Because of this happening I usually. Emphasize saying `"a tiny little splash of almond milk..`" it doesn't always work but most times it does.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Mar 11, 2024~Love this starbucks. Best location by far. I went to a different location cause they were close to where i was at at the time and they made my drink wrong, so i had called this location and they were so sweet. They remade my drink no charge and remembered my name as well. Great customer service and will be coming to this location only(:
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Sep 27, 2022~I go to a different location if I want to sit, but kudos  are needed for the drive through at this location. The did really mess up a pumpkin spice latte once which was frustrating because I didn't have time to go back, but I stick with plain lattes now and they are always gracious and expedient. If you see a super long line like Saturday mid morning, I suggest going elsewhere bc otherwise you're in for a wait, but otherwise they do a bang up job.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Oct 21, 2022~What is the point of ordering from the app to pick up if they wait to heat up your food until you get there. The whole point of ordering ahead is so that it's ready so I can grab it and head to work.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 23, 2022~I've been coming to this Starbucks since it opened. They really take the time to get to know their regular customers and what they like and when they come in. It feels like family when you arrive and they greet you, and when they are already preparing your drink before you even order. Lisa, Dani and all the other stuff members are amazing customer service reps, baristas, and kind people.And... they don't give me hassles about drip refills like the other nearby locations do. Why, because they know customer service is the most important aspect that drives profit, versus nickel and diming regular customers.Thanks for being awesome to the entire morning staff at this location. - Steve Scales (the super tall guy who gets 2 coffees every morning)
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 11, 2021~A Saturday morning with a heavy line at the drive thru seemed like a breeze! The speediness of the service was surprising enough but the customer service was even better. The staff did not seemed stressed whatsoever. My order was a bit complicated and they made it to perfection! Thank you very much because I was expecting a much different experience...
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Nov 15, 2018~My maple pecan latte is fabulous!I arrived at a good time it took only a couple minutes to receive my drinkLocation was clean, not many people around and then bam! It was packed
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Oct 25, 2018~My maple pecan latte is fabulous!I arrived at a good time it took only a couple minutes to receive my drinkLocation was clean, not many people around and then bam! It was packed!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Nov 7, 2020~I'm surprised by some of the reviews for this location my experience was great. While they did seem a bit busy, I was there for five hours working on my computer. I saw them consistently cleaning, the floors and bathrooms making me very comfortable to work outside of my home. Also overheard a situation where a return customer misplaced her order at the wrong location and they amended it with efficiency and kindness. The short haired blonde female behind the counter was an extremely hard worker, never saw her stop moving. Short haired brunette male that took my order even walked my order to me because he knew where I was sitting, rather than calling my name and requiring me to get it myself. I've NEVER had this level of customer service at a Starbucks before. Well done, staff. I will be back.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jan 15, 2020~I have only been through the drive thur twice.  Lines are crazy long, but it moves fast when it does start to move.  You can't mess up on an ice green tea with no sugar!  hahaha...
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Aug 6, 2017~Starbucks? More like Starbugs... This Starbucks has a really nice layout with tons of natural light coming through its big windows illuminating its ample seating area.However, there is a crazy bug infestation! There are beetles, beetles everywhere (cue Buzz Lightyear and Woody meme). I didn't notice until a beetle crawled right up onto my table, but then I realized...there were tons of them. Dead ones littered the floor while live ones carried on their fallen brothers' legacies, crawling in and out of trashcans, on the windows, and over every fathomable surface.The worst part is, when I informed the cashier, she thanked me for letting her know, and I went back to me seat. I optimistically sat back down and waited for someone to come out with a broom or RAID or a flamethrower, but no one ever came. My friend went up as well, just in case they forgot, but they said they knew about it, however `"there was nothing they could do.`"Nothing they could do? I've literally killed +20 of them with my shoes (Vans aren't the best for bug crushing, with the shoes' many-holed soles. Find a pair of steel toed Mocs) and no one has come out with a broom or even bothered to take out the trash. The thing is, they keep coming...If you're into well lit, open seating areas with a premium view of a slaughterhouse of bugs, or you're out of bubble wrap at home and need to get your `"stomp on`", you're in luck - come on by! If not, at least they have a drive-thru :)
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Feb 18, 2019~I like the set up of this store it has a nice big spread out seating area so I'm not sitting on top of the next person. It also has a nice size patio plus a few lounge chairs inside. They were busy but the baristas were pretty quick and really nice I would stop back here again.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 4, 2020~I'm from out of town but was blown away by the courtesy of the staff here. They were patient as I asked questions and really really nice. I will be back :)
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Oct 16, 2016~So I come to this location because of its location. It's very new and they are probably just working out kinks for their speediness and ability to execute correct drink orders.With that said, the line for the drive thru is constantly long and expect to wait about 10-15 min when they don't have their line wrapped around the building. Now if they do have the line wrapped around he building you can easily add another 10 min on there.It gets crazy but people like using he drive through, this location just needs to figure out a way to process orders quicker.I've had a couple orders incorrect but they've fixed it. It's just a hassle when I have my boys with me and I have to turn around and go back in, which was the whole reason for using the drive though, because I have my 3 boys with me all the time and not ideal to unload to get a coffee.I'm hopeful they will get it together and become quicker. This location has a ton of potential and can make a ton Of money being right off the 101. Staff has always been pleasant also.I just left their drive thru and they covered our drinks today because of our long wait... That's a plus!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Apr 25, 2019~First trip to this location and certainly my last. The service was fast but quality was poor. They filled my cup to the top of the cup holder. Not very fair. If I wanted a tall, I would have asked for one. The taste also disappointed.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 10, 2022~First time coming to the Starbucks location and I loved it. I was helped by Lisa in the drive-through and she was so sweet and seemed excited to be working. Will most definitely be coming back to this location!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~May 8, 2021~I ordered two drinks on the app and accidentally sent it to the wrong store. The barista at the pick up counter said `"no problem`" and stopped &amp; made my drinks right there. I so appreciate them going the extra mile like that! Thank you!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jan 2, 2019~My Cappuccino sucked as it tasted like just milk (was a triple shot, which I ordered via the app and tipped!!!!!) and the cashier suspiciously asked what the last four numbers of my Starbucks card were when I bought a mug. You better fix this shithole in terms of personnel bc it is a goldmine of a location.  There is a school, gym and a cemetery nearby and people may come in either full of energy, or grieving. Your people here can't hack that crowd.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~May 12, 2020~This is the best location Starbucks has and I've been to plenty locations across the valley. The morning team is SO awesome at welcoming you, remembering your name, and getting your order right the first time! The entire team is always smiling and attentive to all customers. I haven't had one issue with this location.. I drive by many locations just to come stop here. This morning team ROCKS and I've stopped by in the evenings as well, same friendly great service!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Dec 17, 2020~This is probably the worst Starbucks with a consistent history of failed coffee.  Yes it's my fault for continually trying to get a decent cup of coffee.  Don't go to there, Safeway at 67 has always been good coffee.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 15, 2017~Went to the drive thru at 5:20 AM. Approached the speaker waited for 5 minutes with no response. Pulled up to the window and rudely told it was closed. On the store hours and yelp it was stated the store was supposed! to be open at 4:30AM.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jul 20, 2016~This place is very new but something is definitely wrong here! I've gone in a handful of times now and it's not a very welcoming place. That's unfortunate since it's so close to my work. I walked in and was not even acknowledged for almost two mins standing at the counter after two employees saw me walking up. Over $6 for a coffee on a daily basis and they haven't made any of my drinks correctly. The last time was the final visit for me, they were OUT OF COCONUT MILK! How do you advertise a new drink with coconut milk and run out of supplies???? There are flies flying around the pastries and the staff look angry. Someone needs to address these issues and work on improving asap, this place has lots of potential.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jul 7, 2016~This place just opened and definitely has some kinks to work out. I had good and bad service and have had a total of four visits. Seems to get a little intense when they get busy and the stress shows on their faces. My drink didn't taste so great and the ice melted before I had the chance to leave the place. I hope it gets better soon as the location is super convenient.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Aug 22, 2017~First time coming to this location and was extremely disappointed with their customer service. Ordered 3 venti iced teas and received grandes instead. When we pointed it out they offered to remake it and asked us to pull on the side so they can bring us our drinks when they were done. After waiting 10 min my friend when inside to check what's the hold up.. turns out no one was making our drinks. He was told `"they forgot what car we had`" so they didn't make the drinks anymore...... if my friend hadn't gone in to check the status of the drinks we would have just been waiting out there for nothing. Shocked that they would allow something like that to happen. It wasn't even that busy so I'm not sure how it happened. Also unless I'm mistaken a breve is with half and half. When my friend ordered a breve they added heavy cream instead....!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Mar 26, 2020~So one time I came and asked for iced green tea sweetened and it was super bitter no sugar cane. And then I came today and let's just say you definitely want to ask for `"NO ICE`" at this location!  Don't say I didn't warn you !!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jan 19, 2017~I don't know why they have only 3 stars right now. I've been a caffe addict and I used to go to a different location where I would have to ask them to remake my drink a lot of the time and since switching I haven't had them make my drink once!They have been the friendliest group of barista's and always looks like they are working extra hard to make the customers happy.It's clean and new and a great location.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~May 20, 2021~It only takes one act of rudeness to spoil your experience of a business, which is perhaps unfair. I suppose I am responsible for my own decision to stop here today because it is on the way to work. Usually, I go to another location, and I go there just to avoid coming to this location. Also today, third time our of a handful I have stopped here in the past four years, one employee could have been polite -- oh well. I wonder: How is it that at this particular location I have found interactions disappointing? It's anecdotal evidence that counts less than nothing. Interactions are crucial to a business experience, sometimes if you just say `"sorry`" it all works out just fine.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 24, 2019~Wow, Mary the `"shift supervisor`" has absolutely no customer service, is beyond rude, disrespectful and disregarding!! If a customer has dietary request mocking and rolling eyes as a leader on breeds toxic situations for employees!!! Will never visit this store as a person with a disability it is atrocious!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 1, 2018~I honestly didn't know it was possible for a Starbucks to be bad until I went to this one! My iced coffee always has coffee grinds at the bottoms of cup and it usually tastes burnt, they don't know how to make a regular cup of black tea they just pick whichever flavor they want and give it to you, and to top it off the coffee has made me and other members of my family sick. I know coffee can sometimes have that affect on people but not the whole car full of people (which isn't pleasant if ya know what I mean). Anyway, this location sucks and I wouldn't recommend. Every time I drive by and see a huge line in the drive thru I want to warn everyone that they're going to be highly disappointed!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Feb 12, 2018~Food / drinks are typical of any starbucks for the most part, but the service here can be horrific. A few employees are friendly, but most seem to want nothing to do with their customers and look like they're dreading being there. One lady in particular (with short red hair) was unbelievably angry and apathetic and seemed to be creating a toxic working environment for all of the other employees! The phone rang and she rolled her eyes and slurred words in the middle of taking my order. A couple of times parts of my order were also forgotten and I had to remind them about it. This location is right down the street from me, but I'd rather drive somewhere with friendlier employees at this point.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Mar 25, 2018~We ordered a bagel with cream cheese - it came without cream cheese. We ordered a Ham and Cheese croissant - we got a breakfast sandwich. We ordered an iced tea without sweetener - it came with sweetener. This pretty much sums up most visits to this location. Completely unorganized, coffee stains all over the floor, and some of the employees aren't too friendly. Would rather drive to another Starbucks than walk here since it's closer.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 10, 2018~Best Starbucks I've ever been to. The girls are all sweethearts and always very welcoming, and they get the coffee out quicker than anywhere else. Will continue going to this location for as long as I live here.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 29, 2018~This location is terrible. Poor customer service, bad attitudes by the staff, and did not honor a promo code that they were advertising on their LED ordering screen. I work in pharmaceutical sales and stop and Starbucks 4-5 times a week for my offices. Needless to say, I'll go out of my way to start going to other coffee shops/direct competitors because of the experience I had at this location.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jun 3, 2020~Pretty poor experience at this Starbucks. The drive thru line took well over 20 minutes and when we finally got our drinks the matcha green tea latte looked like iced milk, and tasted like it too. Unfortunate experience to say the least.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jul 2, 2018~Look I don't expect a lot out of people at the time I order my drinks. at 4:30 in the morning it is hard to have a smile true. but today was so irritating. I order my drink and get to the window and I pay. I watch the barista make my drink. she comes to the window and I ask if she could please add more cream. and without hesitation the attitude from her was amazingly rude. she would try to charge me for cream in my coffee WTF. nope not the way it works. I have had issues with this barista before not knowing the drink or making it wrong ok fine but when you are in customer service and you give attitude to a paying costumer  WOW. Not going back to this Starbucks I spend way to much money to be talked to like this.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~May 1, 2017~The strength of this store is its team.  Overall, the employees here are very friendly and engaging . . . I also like the variety in ages of the staff; it's a great mix of people! I've heard others comment on some issues with speed of service in morning, but I've rarely experienced it after numerous visits . . . Also good for working, with plenty of seating inside and out. This store is now one of my go-to locations.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Dec 29, 2016~If there's a slower Starbucks I haven't found it...the older lady that works behind the counter is very very nice, but she doesn't seem to be able to move very quickly..maybe it would be a good idea to have several people working the register at a time... Instead there are employees standing around who look like they don't know what to do.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Nov 27, 2019~I frequent this location because it's close to my house and I can stop either on the way to or from work. Normally it's a great experience, however the last two visits were terrible. I pre-ordered both times and went through the drive thru to pick up my one drink order. Both times I had to wait ridiculously long to get my order and go. Tonight in particular the employee engaged in lengthy banter with the customer in front of me prior to them placing their order and again at the window. I placed my order at 6:47 PM and didn't get to the window to pick it up until 7:01 PM. There was one car ahead of me and the employee tried to give me the wrong drink to boot. I understand being friendly with the customers, but this was beyond inappropriate. To top things off, I was late to work both times due to the unnecessary socializing.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Feb 20, 2020~Went to this starbucks today to get drinks for all my coworkers, i had let the person taking my order know that i had a bigger order and she said it was okay. after ordering my 7 drinks &amp; no cars in front of me i get to the window to hear one of the workers dressed in a white and black striped shirt talking shit about how i ordered 7 drinks. Im glad she can count but she really needs to learn customer service. i heard one of her co workers tell her `"i know theres a lot going on right now`" with me and one person behind me. If you cant take the pressure of working at a starbucks then dont do it. If ur going to complain about 7 drinks needing to be made, you rlly shouldnt be working at starbucks. Now i know why this starbucks only has 2.5 stars. yall need a reality check
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 7, 2019~Slowest Starbucks I have ever been to. Took them 20 minutes to make my drink and they made it wrong but they took so long that I didn't have enough time to have it corrected. I'll be going to a different Starbucks from now on
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~May 17, 2019~By far the worst Starbucks ever! Every time you come here they're extremely slow there's 100 people running around in the kitchen area moving stuff instead of waiting on the customers and the customers wait a minimum of 15 minutes. 15 minute wait has been the last three times I've been here. It's totally absurd. And completely poor management!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 13, 2018~This is my favorite Starbucks I come every morning the reason I come because the people are so friendly they remember my drink and I am in and out quickly. I've gone to many Starbucks and this is my favorite keep up the good work!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Mar 6, 2021~they are always so nice here, especially kayla who has taken my order a few times and is so personable and sweet! best thing is that my drinks are great &amp; i feel valued while still getting through the line quick to start my day!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Oct 14, 2016~First time at this Starbucks and I agree with the other reviewers... So incredibly slow! And constantly talking about how busy they are, there's only two people working  etc...We mobile ordered 10 minutes before we arrived and when we got here our drinks were still not ready. Not a huge deal... We weren't in a big rush. But what was super annoying is that we ordered 2 grande Americanos with room. I would assume the `"with room`" would indicate to them that we were going to put cream in our coffee. She handed us our coffees and then rushed away.  Walked over to the area where you add cream to your to coffee and there's no cream out. Go back over to the counter and wait and wait and wait until she finally comes over and I ask her for cream. Rather than hand me a carafe, she hands me a tiny little mini cup half full of half and half. It wasn't even enough for one of our drinks. Had to go back and ask for more cream and again had to hear how they're so busy, she'll get to it when she can...This is the second Starbucks I've gone to where they've done that... Rather than have a carafe of cream available, they pour a tiny bit into a little mini cup. Super irritating!  Just put the carafe of half and half out so I can add the amount I want to my coffee.We don't live anywhere near this area, we were just stopping in after a volleyball game out this way but since there are several other Starbucks in the area, we would definitely go to a different Starbucks next time.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Oct 5, 2016~Only come here if you have LOTS of time. I ordered a caramel Frapuccino with no whip and a coconut mocha. First they were out of Frap mix (seriously?  isn't Frappuccinos one of the most popular menu items?) I waited and  waited when people behind me started to get their orders I asked about mine. They handed me a Caramel Frap with whip cream. Which was wrong. The barista went over to the sink and scrapped of the whipped cream. She handed me the drink. After waiting for 5 more minutes I asked about my second drink. They all looked very confused. Finally they asked me what did I order. After 20 minutes I finally got my drink. When I told them how long I waited they didn't seem to surprised. No one apologized so I guess if you have 20-30 minutes to wait for your morning coffee this is the place for you.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Mar 3, 2019~I love this location. I was surprised to see low reviews. I have always been treated well and my drinks have been right. Adrianna is always so happy!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jul 29, 2016~Great location, friendly enough staff, but often seems understaffed and slow. Maybe it's the early kinks of a new place, but they need more staff and a better hustle.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 19, 2017~This Starbucks is on point! Honestly first Starbys in a while that has given me my iced coffee ice cold. Thanks babes!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Aug 3, 2016~Worst Starbucks I have been to. Each time I have been to this location I am the only one waiting for a beverage and it takes FOREVER!!!! It's almost humorous!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~May 14, 2017~The hours posted are not accurate. They close at 9:30 everyday, except Sunday they close at 9. And the employees are super slow.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 20, 2017~Easter Sunday was my 10 year old's birthday.  I saw this store was open so I pulled over to `"treat`" my son to his favorite coffee.  We asked the cashier if they gave free coffee's to people with birthdays and we were told only if you have a Gold Card.  We don't have one, but Lisa M. decided she would personally buy my son his coffee as he was disappointed he didn't get anything for having a birthday!  Not only did she buy him a small caramel frappe out of her own pocket, Cody and Kailey decided to upgrade to a Grande with EXTRA caramel!  My son was the happiest 10 year old!  Thank you!!!  You guys are the best!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Dec 13, 2016~My son and I get Starbucks treat for ourselves sometimes after picking him up from school. We were happy when this location opened as its now the closest Starbucks drive thru to us. Have been here probably more than 10x since it opened and I can say 50-50 satisfaction with the negatives due to not getting the order right from that lady with a short hair. Late this afternoon when we had a drive thru, there was no one in line, and the barista  at the window was a guy with a little wavy hair. We had 4 items ordered, 2 of them drinks. I paid and got all orders except for my venti shaken iced tea. I saw the guy make the drink and as he finished he kind of drop his head and for a little while I wasn't sure what he was doing as he was either blowing or spitting on my drink??? As I got it and about to leave, my son who was seated right behind the driver seat told me he saw the guy spit on my drink. #$%##$...I wasn't sure what I thought I saw but my son saw it too!  We are never coming back to this SB and be cautious on others too. If we only had time before our errand, I could have parked and went in to talk with him, but we were in a hurry. I didn't touch the drink except stick in the straw and after 2.5hrs returned at drive thru and left it at same window.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Sep 10, 2024~I was at target shopping the other day and I needed a a drink before I leave. I stopped at Starbucks and it was right before they close. Amari King was kind enough to take my order and not turn me down even though I had three orders and it was a one minute before closing time. He has a good customer service and I'm happy that Starbucks still hires such a employee like that.
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Apr 22, 2022~Fast service, but paid a lot to have missing main ingredient (missing oatmilk, and it's right in the name of the drink and I assumed I didn't have to ask for it.). I wondered why it wasn't full to top. Only modification I asked for was only 1 pump of syrup instead of the full norm and barista confirmed that.
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Nov 20, 2018~I was dying for coffee today and something new, and the only thing close by was Starbucks. If you know me and my reviews I am not a fan of Starbucks. I'm honest in saying I've never had anything great to say really or decent service for that matter. That changed today. I was shopping in Target and there is a Starbucks located inside so I figured what the heck. I was acknowledged right away with a smile and after looking over the menu I didn't see anything that stood out and was interested in so I asked the barista what she may recommend of a Keto friendly drink. I was told how many people love the peach white tea with heavy whipping cream and sugar free vanilla so I went for it! It was AMAZING! The only other Keto drink  I've found I like is the cold brew from Dutch Bros. I also ordered a small peppermint mocha because hey it's the holidays! The barista was quick and so friendly and we even chit chatted a little while no one else was waiting. There may be hope after all.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~4~Oct 19, 2021~I didn't like this Target store but the Starbucks was fine. The Baristas were very professional. I did not have any negative issues with them as mentioned by other Yelpers.I subtract one star for lack of ambience, seating and no place to charge my phone.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~5~Aug 2, 2023~My Dr office is across the street and this was the closest Starbucks. Just want to say that the 2 young ladies working on the morning of Wednesday, Aug 2 were about as pleasant &amp; good natured as you'd want someone to be while buying a $7 coffee, ha!  Yes, friendly service. Zero ambience because there's no seating here. Get your coffee and get out!! Lucky girls lol
Phoenix, AZ 85015~1~Jun 23, 2024~I just wanted a cup of ice to put my baby's drink in for him . I waited patiently but a lady named Vanessa was very rude and ignored my presence twice. When I finally asked her for the ice I wanted she just looked at me and turned her back, luckily another worker heard me and gave me the ice right away. I understand if it's busy and you're having a bad day but that's not how you treat a person. They weren't that busy for her to be annoyed at me . Plus there was like 5 people behind that counter. I work as a barista too and I've had a line out the door but I wasn't that rude to ignore someone presence.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~2~Apr 2, 2019~FRUIT FLIES!?!? The service at this location is a little bit slow and I definitely spent a ton of time waiting. However the girls making the drinks are very nice. I just may not come back to this location again!
Phoenix, AZ 85015~1~Dec 23, 2021~I'd give zero stars if I could ordered a Carmel ribbon crunch Frappuccino and they gave it to me as a plain Carmel Frappuccino didn't tell me they couldn't do when I asked for extra cookie crumbs she said they didn't have any and my drink which was supposed to have it didn't but yet she had it to sprinkle on the whip cream beyond disappointing
Phoenix, AZ 85015~1~Mar 7, 2021~My daughter and I came in this morning and apparently both the baristas that were working were not morning people. Neither one of them acknowledged us until we were standing there a while. No good morning no hello. Then after we ordered I attempted to pay with my Starbucks app which she rudely stated she can't scan there. Which is fine but there was no reason to be rude about it. I'm sorry but if you're really not a morning person please don't get a job serving coffee in the mornings.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~1~Dec 23, 2016~Very disappointing for a Starbucks. Line of people waiting and cashier was more interested in labeling canisters. Heard that she didn't have what the person in front of me wanted and although they advertised on their board the Holiday drink I requested, they didn't have that either. I said yes when the cashier asked if I wanted my receipt and she told me I could grab it myself while she continued with her labels.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~4~Mar 10, 2019~It's a Starbucks inside a Target. It's spacious enough, the service is prompt, and they really keep it pretty clean considering the traffic they get in there. I'm not like a `"Starbucks fix`" person but my friends who are don't object to this one -- even with the Missouri location just being a few mins away.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~2~Mar 2, 2015~The first time I went to this Starbucks I ordered a vanilla steamer. The girl seemed very nervous and frazzled and she looked at me like I had three heads. I proceeded to explain to her the contents of the beverage, milk and vanilla syrup. She then charged me for a latte which is more expensive, so I told her that it's usually cheaper, then she looked annoyed and then confused, then she figured out which button to push to charge me less. Then, (against my better judgment), I asked her for a large cup of ice water, to which she replied she was only allowed to give water in the small cup. I offered to pay for the larger cup, she looked at the register screen for a moment, then quickly decided it was easier to just give me the cup. My beverages were delivered and out the door I went. Bad experience, but I figured I'd give it another try. I went in today, had a different barista, and although this one wasn't confused, she seemed very tired and overworked and couldn't stop what she was doing to make eye contact or even smile. I kinda felt bad for her!What REALLY did it for me was that while I was waiting in line today I saw a bug in the display buzzing from piece of bread to piece of beead. It was gross and it really did it for me. It's no fun going to Starbucks if you're just not happy with the entire experience of starbucks. You'll get your drink made, but don't expect much in the arenas of cleanliness and customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~1~Dec 26, 2019~I have always come to this location and I have had a love, hate relationship with this location but it's now a hate relationship with it now. On December 24th, 2019, I went to this location to get three simple drinks, the line was a bit slow but I didn't mind waiting. Once I got to order, the guy that helped me was being pain rude once I ordered and was being difficult when I asked for 2 sugars in my ice coffee, I didn't take it to offensive and sat down. When I got my three drinks all three of them were a mess, the caramel frap was literally all whip cream, and the coffees were all mixed up. Not only were they rude, they messed up all my drinks and the store looked so dirty. The employees should really be talked to about they disgusting attitude.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~1~Sep 11, 2019~There were three employees working. Monique (blue hair), Victor (glasses), and a new girl I believe her name was Amber (brown hair low pony tail) but I'm not 100% sure. Monique was being useless, restocking and telling the other two employees to go grab her other things while there was a 10 person line. Victor was making drinks and trying to help Amber ring people up. Amber was doing her best but a handful of the people had modified drinks. Monique made multiple comments about how her coworkers were soo much younger than her and didn't know how to do anything. As a manager of a retail store it disgusts me to see an employee treat they're coworkers this way. Monique is NOT a team player and I really hope corporate sees this and corrective action is taken. Having an employee that brings others down instead of teaching and helping the team is going to cost you good employees and customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~5~Apr 26, 2015~I go here all the time. It is located inside of Target, and I have never had an issue. It occasionally gets a bit busy.... all the shoppers want their coffee. Same prices here as any other Starbucks, in fact they don't charge for flavor shots added to normal coffee :) I'll be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~1~Aug 2, 2020~Left this place feeling extremely upset. I came to this location at 9 pm because it showed it was still open on maps. So, I came over because I am a Starbucks lover! I mean who doesn't like coffee at night... but Yes don't get me wrong a lot of stores did change there hours due to Covid. Walked in and asked the lady who was organizing the mugs up front if they were closed. But just my luck they where closed and I said thank you okay good night. But her coworker wanted to be smart mouth and say `"that was such a stupid question`" I turn around said excuse me!... what did you say? Clearly the girl was afraid to say it back. I told her I wanted her name and then she apologized and said it was a really long day. She stated her name was Gabriella but Who knows. Whoever was in charge of closing tonight on July 2, 2020 needs to clear be retained on customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~1~Jun 5, 2017~Why would you put a new hire on the register durning the morning rush? That lead to multiple order mixups. Horrible service and customer service. I'll stick to my normal store.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~1~Dec 23, 2018~Ewwww!  Nothing more gross than watching the Starbucks guy rubbing under/in his nose with his gloves on before he continues to prepare drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~5~Mar 25, 2017~After rhe shitty service I received at target it was extremely refreshing to have such a beautiful and professional young lady named Brittany acknowledged me and explain she would be right with me. I then did jot specify I wanted my drink over ice. When I asked for it she politely said `" oh let me make it again as it won't taste right`".  Which I insisted it was just fine like it was I just needed ice.   I am a customer service supervisor for a  major grocery store chain through out the United States and finding a person let alone a young person with such excellent customer service skills is a rarity.  To this young lady. My hats off to you. And to your supervisor she is the employee you should be looking at for advancement. Thank you for toiyr smile Brittany.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~1~Sep 30, 2018~Understaffed. One of the two employees is complaining loudly that the staff last night didn't do their jobs. Counters and floor are filthy. Just trashy.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~4~Nov 3, 2015~This is a decent in-store bistro that serves the usual Starbuck's fare.  The prices are good and the coffee is the same as it is at all other stores.  The menu is a little abbreviated due to the space but they have the specials and seasonal stuff.  There does not seem to ever be enough people working there as it backs the line up.  I really like the Starbucks app that allows me to pay with my phone.  Not much to eat there but I don't really eat there; I get coffee.  I like the convenience but I really do think the staffing needs to be evaluated because I often forgo coffee due to the number of people waiting.  The staff they do have is very courteous and perform their jobs well.  My orders are always correct. They just need to have more people working there.
Phoenix, AZ 85015~1~Mar 4, 2017~This is the shittiest Starbucks in the valley. They're always short handed and by noon are always out of this that or the other. Horrible!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Sep 27, 2022~I have to come to this location to work from two days a week. Every time I come in, they are super friendly, my order is always right and they always have the best music on. Sometimes Disney, today late 80's early 90's pop and R&amp;B. They have usually 6-8 people on staff and dang do they hustle! The great thing about this location too is that they have a mobile order pick up window so you don't even have to come in. Just go to the window. 5 stars is not enough for this location!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Mar 25, 2024~2 stars for the great staff.Coffee was coffee.  The huge disappointment is the recommendation of the Double Bacon Sandwich that only has 2 pieces of bacon.  Bacon is life.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Sep 25, 2024~the service was really bad. I mean, one of the employees was laughing and giggling to her friends instead of giving me my drink. Now it's all melty. the drink was really good and all it's just melty. I went through the drive-through.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jul 15, 2024~I went  to Starbucks and I got my kids two cake pops for one of them. The state came out immediately and the other one just came like this with no stick all messed up.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Aug 10, 2024~Got my mobile order wrong. How am I gonna pull up, already ordered through the app and they ask me what's in the order??? And gave me a drink with someone else's name on it! 1 star
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Nov 10, 2023~At 6am service is great, people are nice, first time here and I had no problems.  Drive through went at a normal Starbucks pace, nothing crazy. All I can ask for at 6am is a welcoming smile to start my day so thanks to the employees for being up and happy when the rest of us don't want to be.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jul 6, 2024~The coffees were terrible the girls working there today 6/7/24 at 5:34pm, have no idea how to make the drinks. I ordered an oat milk brown shaken espresso and it was totally off. They need serious retraining. Also they seem unfazed that almost every customer was returning their drinks because they were off. The only one who knows what they're doing is Juan the Manager which I feel sorry for because his incompetent staff. He was kind and refunded me for the 4 drinks and remade  two of them.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Feb 6, 2024~I walked in to order, and the guy was instantly was condescending and rude. And basically asked if I knew how to order, I actually use to work at Starbucks couple years ago. And know everything about it. And I know for a fact he is the shift lead, so yea way to lead by example my guy. Anyway that's that.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~May 13, 2023~i've gone to this location 4 times in the last 2 weeks and every time i go the drive thru moves incredibly slow, im in line for a min of 10 mins every single time, is it that they put untrained workers by themselves or maybe the machines don't work properly? idk but something needs to get fixed cause this is insane, i haven't had this problem at any other location, the drinks get made correctly but no one wants to wait 10+ mins when there's only 2 cars in front of you?
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Nov 27, 2023~The drive thru takes literally 45 minutes around 8-9am. I understand a bit of back up; but they do it on purpose; they make everybody wait behind the intercom so their times look better than they are! I've been late to work twice when I left my house with an extra 30 mins for the stop.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Nov 11, 2023~It honestly sucks to give this location two stars because for the last 7 years, this has been my favorite Starbucks in Phoenix. However, it's clearly changed and it's due to MANY reasons. The first one, their speed has decreased by a lot and that's even if you place an online order. Lately, I'll have to submit my order 20 minutes early and even then my drink won't be ready when I get there. Most of the time when I get there, there will ge 5+ people waiting which wasn't like this before. I also request for light ice and they put extra (literally filling up the whole cup) which is irritating because it's the opposite of what I asked. Another thing is that if you're doing a pickup, it can take them 10 minutes to even acknowledge you. A simple heads up letting numerous people know they'll be right with them can go a long way. Specially when they're already taking 20/30 minutes to give you your drink. Today was my breaking point with this location because the coffee I ordered tasted like pure water, I'm not even kidding. Luckily, when I called in to let them know they did make it right and that's why I'm giving them two stars. I hope that this store does turn towards the right direction because I love this place but the service has been a turn off.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Mar 3, 2023~I moved to this area about 7 years ago from North Phoenix and this spot instantly became my go-to Starbucks. When you visit here, you can expect for the staff to speak with you and treat you very well. The food is so delicious and I highly recommend it. My favorite was the chorizo breakfast sandwich but it was discontinued so now I get the double smoked croissant. Always a clean restaurant and super chill with great music! 10/10 recommend. I did have a mishap where the sandwich bag was ripped at the bottom and so my croissant fell but it's okay, my dog had a great breakfast. Despite this, I would still go back and do business with them.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Mar 19, 2023~The service on drive thru was quick on a Sunday! This is my go to spot for Starbucks. I love the iced matcha!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Mar 10, 2024~rude management and employees, always mess up order, somethings always broke or not working or out of ingredient, orders always wrong, line is always backed up, high turnover rate never same barista. Avoid at all cost
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Jan 11, 2024~I came here today because Starbucks has a deal of $3 grande drinks. As we walked in we were greeted with the most RUDE worker I've ever come across. Her name was Nancy and she had the worst attitude. I thought that I was the only one who noticed but I was listening around and noticed that other people also noticed the same thing. Overall our drinks were good but cooperate needs to check that girls attitude.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Dec 20, 2023~Okay what has happened to this SB the employees in the afternoon/night are so very rude the other afternoon they were giving me attitude for no reason they just handed me my drink I got a dragonfruit refresher and you know when a drink is watered down by the color and taste of it. I waited almost 10 min for them to help me again at their drive thru window and they acted like they couldn't see me I don't know why they act like they own the whole company can't they just help nicely? Also the other day I was very sick so I requested a drink with no ice and I saw an extra charge  I asked why that extra charge and it was because I didn't add ice I told themthat it would be nice if next time before adding the charge they can ask nicely or offer for another $1.00 if we would like extra base instead of getting mad and rolling their eyes I mean come on and they were all females. The rudest one is a short young female who always has a ponytail. I hope new friendly people get hired I'm tired of getting my day ruined by these type of baristas.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Nov 19, 2023~If it were possible to rate this location 0 stars I would. The ONLY reason I go to this location is because it happens to be in my neighborhood. I genuinely go out of my to drive MILES to go to another SB. Let's start with what happened today, I did a mobile order, which tbh I was surprised wasn't disabled like it normally is 95% of the time. I ordered a venti hot caramel Macchiato with vanilla sweet cold foam a bagel with cream cheese and a chocolate cake pop. I asked my friend to pick up for me since I've been sick for 2 weeks and don't feel like getting anyone sick. He gets there they tell him they don't have an order for me, I send him the receipt. They give him an attitude and trust me he wasn't the one today. He is then handed a drink and told to have a great day. He says where are the other items, they give him more attitude and say what items? He shows them the receipt, they hand him a strawberry cake pop and say ok there you go. He looks at it and tells them it's wrong the girl very annoyed and with an even bigger attitude looks inside and says it's fine and hands it back. He has to tell them 3 times it's supposed to be chocolate so they finally get it and try to yet again send him on his way. He says to them that they're missing the bagel with cream cheese and they look at him as if though he was is a martian. He again shows them the receipt. Then, with even more attitude get the items and toss it at him. He gets here and I realize he was given the WRONG drink. This place has just become so unprofessional. I have so many other examples but one I can share is that they close at certain hours and I'm sure modified hrs due to the pandemic but they close their DT at 8 pm. On this night there were 4 cars total in the drive thru and I pulled up to a gentleman saying that the drive thru was closed after the car in front of me. I looked at the time it was 7:30! I asked if they were going to take 30 minutes to help 4 cars and the employee seemed to get nervous. I asked him are you allowed to close the DT early? I asked for a manager and he said no mgr was on staff and he allowed me in the line. I made it to the window by 7:40 and I felt bad for all the other cars they turned away when they shouldn't have. This is my REG SB and I know a lot of the hardworking employees working there and I respect everyone but corporate does need to look into this very location. There are a lot of things I'm sure aren't supposed to happen happening.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Nov 6, 2023~Went through the drive thru this morning and it took 15 minutes for them to take my order at the intercom and then another 10 minute wait to get to the window :( Good thing I was running early to work. Usually the service here is quicker though!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Oct 6, 2023~Perfect service! We came in when it was busy and Anna was extremely accommodating and made our experience friendly and easy.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Apr 6, 2024~these btcs sounding like they dont wanna work like bro go to a warehouse fkn bums always sounding ugly and cant make orders right
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Sep 2, 2023~Deserves zero stars. No one should be stuck in your drive thru for 20 minutes just to get a watered down drink and a cold breakfast sandwich. Used to work at Starbucks and know sometimes staffing is rough but there was more than enough workers laughing. 4th bad experience in a row. Highly recommend another location.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Aug 28, 2022~Today was my birthday and Thank you Starbucks for my free coffee!! The staff was awesome, especially Miss Sweetness, Sylvia. She was such a sweetheart!! And this was the best Iced Latte I've had at any Starbucks...ever!!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jan 29, 2024~been here a few times and it's always a long wait for bad drinks. employees are rude, the girl at the front didn't even greet or make eye contact. a woman reached for her hot drink at the counter that had no sleeve and employee said `"wait i'm still prepping`", the drink had been sitting on the counter ready for about 2 minutes before she came and grabbed. if a drink isn't ready, maybe don't put it on the counter where ppl come up to grab their drinks?
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jul 22, 2023~They're so slow they suck no joke, don't go to this place you'll be waiting for like 10 minutes to get your drink after waiting forever to even order
Phoenix, AZ 85017~4~Jul 17, 2020~Over the years I've been coming to this location I've seen the turnover and met new faces. I'm known there by name by at least 1 barista but others are familiar with my face. They know my drink and are always kind greeting me with a smile and hello. Although things have change with how SB does business due to the pandemic, these employees continue to do their best. This is by far my Fave location out of the 4 that I frequent.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Nov 7, 2016~Came in for an eggnog steamer and the barista tells me `"you mean latte?`" No I mean steamer, and you know which one the guy gave me? Not what I ordered. #newemployee #knowyourmenu #thecustomerisalwaysright #mondayblues
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Nov 12, 2022~Waited for my drink ten people who came after me got there drinks I had to ask them about it for them to even start on it smh and then it tasted watered down
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~May 4, 2021~This was the worst experience I've ever had in Starbucks in the States. After I ordered plain black coffee for my parents, I went 5 minutes later to pick it up. To my surprise, my parents told me that their coffee was cold! I checked and fair enough it was cold. So I went back Jasmine the barista and told her that the coffee was cold, she told me I was too late to pick up my coffee thus it became cold!!!Now which hot coffee gets cold after few minutes? They served up cold old coffee, I demanded a refund immediately.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Jan 24, 2017~Probably the worst Starbucks I have ever been to!First, I visit a Starbucks at least 3 times a week. So for me to stop at a random shop out of my neighborhood isn't unheard of for me.Went through the drive thru on a sunny Tuesday afternoon. Only 1 car in front of me. Placed my order, iced Venti coconut milk caramel macchiato. As soon as I pulled up to the window my drink was ready. 1 star for the pleasant girl at the window, 1 star for the speed. As we all know sometimes Starbucks is as slow as waiting for drip coffee at home. Paid my $6.35 and drove off.This had to have been the worst espresso ever. Bitter with a horrible aftertaste plus my drink was void of any caramel, not a drop in the bottom, not a drop on the lid, not a drop down n the side of my glass. And I did not taste any of the normal vanilla syrup they usually use. It was unsweetened, or it tasted like it was. If I wanted black coffee I would stop at Circle K or QT and pay $5 less.So much for my afternoon caffeine buzz.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jun 25, 2021~Bad experience this morning unfortunately. I typically order ahead and pick up on my drive to work but order ahead was unavailable so when I got to the store I checked their temporary hours and they were open but the door was locked. I got a dirty look from an employee who gave me a car driving motion. I get they are short staffed but come on smile and tell me nicely. So I went and waited in the drive thru line and then I got a paper straw. Morning was sucky. I hate soggy straws. So I added my own!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~May 15, 2021~Terrible place. The girl that took my order paid no attention to my order and I received an awful drink  By far the worst experience 0 stars
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Sep 20, 2020~Staff is warm, welcoming and relatable, but the drive-thru is incredibly long with no sense of rush or efficiency. Once I got to the speaker, I had to repeat my order twice for it to be right and it still came wrong. I didn't want to make a fuss because I had waited in line for 35-mins and felt bad for the people behind me.The staff wasn't aware of the new Starbucks app features either, which definitely delayed the purchase process while they asked what I was showing them. It's incredibly frustrating when they can't seem to get it together and you could see people (who had pre-ordered) waiting for their order inside as well.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Jan 18, 2020~A general complaint about Starbucks that cannot be said as frequently for other coffee shops: they cater poorly to customers who want decaf options. Why decaf? Caffeine's `~6-hour half life is why I don't drink it in the afternoons. I'm early to bed and early to rise, and I like my coffee having a strong effect on me in the morning. That's why I have only one in the AM. Then I several more throughout the day sans caffeine (decaf has a pinch of it, but nothing impactful). So, back to Starbucks, and this one in particular -- which I do agree is worthy of its low review average. Generally, I expect to wait five minutes for a decaf pour-over (always Pike Place). However, they did not have that option available. They only had decaf Americanos. This is silly and unacceptable; at any place that purports to be a coffee shop, coffee of all kinds should be available around the clock, not solely espresso. When I did get my Americano, it was *way* too watered down. Some recipes call for 1:1 or 1:2 espresso/water ratios. If that's the average variety, this one was 1:10. In other words, I waited over ten minutes for a cup of hot water.Why the long wait? As other reviewers have mentioned, this Starbucks handles their crowds badly. Now, here I dole out some sympathy; they've got the drive-thru, mobile orders, and in-person customers. This is tough to juggle, so I'd strongly recommend they figure out how to do it. Whatever they are doing now is highly ineffective, and the in-person customers get the raw end of the deal.Finally, holy noise! Dear children, it's a Starbucks, not a club! They were bumping house jams on high volume, which only served to add an extra element of stress to the ambiance. Yes, this Starbucks is just stressful to be in or around. So, won't be back! I don't think theirs is a lost cause with adequate training, but so far -- on all fronts -- they fail spectacularly. Godspeed to those customers who are saddled with this one as their closest option.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Dec 19, 2020~I got here at 7:34pm tonight because I just wanted a medicine ball. Two Starbuck girls was standing where you order and directed me to leave because they are closed. I double checked my time because they were helping other people and it was only 734pm. I did as directed and started to drive in opposite direction and almost got side swapped by another vehicle.I went to Thomas and i17 and got there at 748pm where they were short staffed and didn't have the privilege of having 2 workers standing outside and still made my medicine ball and happily!!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Mar 16, 2022~Enzo was such a help this morning at the drive through! He was very patient and gave great customer service at such an early hour. Great location would definitely recommend.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Mar 13, 2022~Drinks and cake pops were but we found an eye lash in our drink which isn't to bad but it's still kinda gross
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Jan 2, 2023~this girl, looked the age of a college student , named Kim MADE MY DAY. She saw me crying and distraught. She brought me over an iced water and a butter croissant and said `" We are here for you. Would you like a hug?`"She acted with compassion and kindness which to me deserves attention. Kim did not have to be a friendly stranger in a time of need , but she choose too. someone please give her a raise
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Mar 5, 2020~You guys suck dick. God damn, I was waiting in line for the promotion happy hour for over 30 minutes!!! Horrible and slow service. Needs better employees.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Dec 15, 2023~as a starbucks connoisseur, i wanted to love this location, i really did. however, i can not stand by their RIDICULOUS wait times and slow place. i understand a bit of backup, but i just waited 40 minutes in the drive-thru at 1pm for one drink and a food item! got up to the area to order and it took them an additional five minutes to take my order, then arrived at the window. sat there for about seven minutes and no one even opened the window to tell me they would be right with me. when they finally did, there was no apology for the wait or any sort of accommodation. the worker seemed irritated to be serving me to be honest. i have worked in food service for multiple years and i've never experienced anything like this. the only reason i gave them two stars is because the quality of the drinks are good. so, if you have a good hour and a half to kill to wait for a drink come and get it here! otherwise, go to dutch bros.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Aug 16, 2019~Thanks for the serious anxiety attack Starbucks - that's me ruined for the day. I don't typically write bad reviews, but if you mess with me that much, I'll take my personal time to write you a scathing critique on everything done incorrectly and expect future procedural changes. Because you can't mess it up any worse and need the below pointed out to you....I waited, inside the store, 25 minutes for a coffee ordered at 8.47am. You failed me, and virtually everyone inside that waited for the absolute thronged mess that was present. Whilst I waited, I realized that YOU are not set-up to deal with 10+ people. You simply can't do it. So, if you know this, why do you continue to work on mobile orders as a priority to people already INSIDE your place of business? The area where service is delivered was continuously full of food drinks that remained largely uncollected over the duration of my stay. One lady lost her order because someone just walked out with because it was so unorganized. Maybe you should put hold on mobile orders to clear the severe backlog of in-store customers, as opposed to the plague to your business that is mobile orders? Maybe, keep the mobile orders stored 'anywhere else but the counter'? Maybe, have a collection area? Maybe, the customers should read the labels and not walk off with other peoples stuff? It's just a whole lazy mess. And then priorities drive-thru orders over in-store orders.....then, I get upset...Also, if you're busy, you can tell you are by the coffee zombies hoarded around the service area, ask them to wait elsewhere in the store so everyone else can either a) order, b) here the names of the orders being delivered, or c) actually collect their orders. Maybe make a designated collection area. Anything. Anything is better than, THAT....you don't have much room, but you can figure it out.....hopefully....I was told that GCU moved in today, or recently, hence the increased numbers. If those kind of numbers continue, I would expect business changes to cater for this. Some semblance of a back-up plan.....It angered me that I came to a coffee shop to order a coffee, to see nobody walking out with coffee.....Well, that's just me. I wanted, on my day off, recovering from surgery earlier in the week, to enjoy the ambience of a 'coffee shop' and relax and unwind. And I just stood there and realized that Starbucks as a business is not what it was, and for this store, management needs to figure out a new trick, because today, you failed. Oh. And to the lady that nearly t-boned me trying to escape the car park into moving traffic; hands are for steering, not sipping your venti cooler and checking what's in the backseat. Probably a load of mobile orders that weren't yours.....have a nice day.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Oct 5, 2019~EVERY SINGLE VISIT-if I can give this place no stars, it would be perfect for this location. Seriously, a cup of water &amp; two puppuccino's with a 20 minute wait time. The wait wasn't even the worst to say the least, literally everyone behind with more of a bigger order received theirs first AND NO-theirs was not done thru mobile ordering `"sOrRy wE GoTtA GeT tHeiR oRdErs DoNe fIrSt bC tHeY cAMe BeFoRe YoU`" BS ...Chronological order didn't come across here well. Speaking of mobile ordering, this Starbucks really had a lady wait more than 20 minutes when her order was done on mobile ordering before arrival. This location sucks balls at customer service. After the entire line was cleared was she then noticed. Jeezus, I thought I was blind but a team of 3-5 people &amp; no one cared to acknowledge her or at least under too much pressure of a line to acknowledge. Seriously 7 customers &amp; the team is running around like headless chickens. Embarrassing for her to scream her head off but I can see why she was upset. Oh &amp; btw, being snarky to a customer who in this situation happens to be right-- Starbucks on Bethany really suckkkkk. Don't bother stopping by this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Nov 24, 2021~Went in 4 pm on a Wednesday and they don't have all day breakfast sandwiches except for a feta wrap which I did get. Also they didn't have vanilla bean powder to put in my drink. A disappointment. Also the line takes a good 20 minutes.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Oct 21, 2022~I called 5 minutes ago to make sure that this location had their bacon, Gouda, and egg sandwich and they said they did and I looked online to make sure they did as well, and it said they did. I walked in the store to order and not only was the cashier extremely rude to me and treated me like I did not matter but she told me I was wrong when I said I called and they said they had them. While I was ordering I also had a woman mopping in the store who decided it was appropriate and okay for who to mop over my shoes while I was ordering? I am usually a fan of Starbucks but u didn't appreciate the customer service here at all. It also took 20 minutes for my sandwich to come out along with it being cold when I got it
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Feb 17, 2020~I can see why this place has fews. `"Light Ice`" means do not fill the cup pretty much to the top with ice.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Apr 6, 2020~Very fast service, friendly staff, and made my kids day by giving them cake pops, Thank you:) I really appreciate all that you do!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~4~Aug 14, 2018~So I wanted to review this Starbucks especially because it has pretty bad reviews. We came about 40 mins before closing and they didn't have cold brew. Which was very upsetting. The girl was very accommodating and made some suggestions on drinks I could order instead. I got a triple shot decaf macchiato. She then offered to change it if I didn't like it. I normally get this drink but I wanted something not too sweet. They made it perfect and the fact that she wanted to make sure I was happy and satisfied made the biggest difference.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Jan 29, 2019~Came to this location to get my favorite caramel frappe at Chino with nonfat milkZack was very friendly I was in and out within a few minutes. I wasn't sure how to do the mobile ordering and Zach took the time to walk me through it on my phone for future orders a very nice guy you're lucky to have him
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Aug 2, 2020~Just don't come here lol. They never have anything on the menu and the drive thru takes about 20 minutes every day at any given time
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~May 28, 2021~Honestly I used to go here every day cause it's right by my house but I literally go to one way further away because there's a really good chance someone working here is going to start my day off way wrong. Multiple baristas act as if they're being held there against their will like the job is so difficult. I worked in coffee shops for 3 years, simple customer service isn't that hard. These workers at this location have the absolute worst attitudes I've ever seen at an establishment.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Jul 22, 2020~I've come to this Starbucks a few times and each time has been a great experience because of the staff! They are always so friendly and kind. I appreciate that even when there is a long line of cars, they still provide excellent customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~May 5, 2022~I have been a s.b customer for 12yrs.. never have I been told between the hrs of 5am-9am we do not have dark roast brewed unit I started coming here.. it happens on a regular bases.. from this point forward.. I will sit at the window &amp; block the line until they do their job!!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Dec 7, 2019~The services are super SLOW!! When I order my drink on the app, before I arrived to the store, they didn't make my drink until maybe 10-15 after i had arrived, also taste is okay not same as before.. I'm disappointed
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Nov 17, 2020~This is my local Starbucks and I love it! It's a very busy and popular location, which means there is usually a long line for the drive thru. But using the mobile app to order ahead is an easy solution! The staff is SO friendly and hard-working, and they always have my mobile order ready for pickup literally 5 minutes after I put it in. Such a friendly Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Jan 1, 2018~Came here to get a drink and do some work but internet is terrible. Don't expect to get anything done here.When I used to live in Phoenix I would always come here to study and work but WiFi was much better back then. I am visiting for the Holidays and wanted to spend some time here to reminisce old times but it's not the same. Service is terrible and they forgot to make 1 of my drinks. It's super loud and noisy and wifi is so bad. I cannot get anything to load. One tip I would give is to be very careful of your belongings here because I have witnessed a laptop being stolen here. Someone just came into the store and grabbed a MacBook and ran out. They called the cops and the MacBook owner even ran after the thief but nobody could catch him.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Dec 19, 2019~All Starbucks employees should know their promos... or maybe the girl who took my order didn't want to apply the happy hour special, I even showed her the date and time, and she didn't do it. Even explaining and showing her, she still didn't do it. I didn't want to argue, because this place is always busy, I took my one drink and left.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jan 26, 2022~They are never open in the morning anymore, I tried to go today and they don't open tell noon ?
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Oct 25, 2021~Never have Mobil ordering turned on, the manager does things how they want over what is best for the customer, half the time I try to get coffee and it's a 20 minute or more wait. And the staff is just rude
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jul 20, 2019~There was a line of 3 people and it took 30 minutes to get my one coffee. The person in line before me got their drink messed up, then when I got my drink the tall cup was only halfway filled.... $5 for a half a cup of a flat white .... no. This was absolutely a horrible experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jun 17, 2019~This location can never get my simple drink right no matter how detailed i am when i order it. The staff is unorganized and they dont seem to value their customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Aug 6, 2017~By far the worst Starbucks I've ever been to! I couldn't hear the guy on the speaker and when I was getting ready to order my drink he rudely cuts me off and pretty much yells at me telling me `"to hold on`" um? Okay. Has me waiting literally like 10 minutes at the speaker to order and after telling him my order three times I said `"venti`" really loud! And he kept saying `"the medium`"? I mean....is that what venti is? Get this Justin guy a new job if he doesn't like his current one because there is no reason to be rude to customers just cause you're not liking your job. The ironic part is that at the window there was a sign asking about service and to let them know if they didn't go `"above and beyond`" so here is my way of letting you guys know you had the worst service of all Starbucks I've been to.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Jul 10, 2019~I've been to several Starbucks and staff is always very nice and knowledgeable.  I come to this location for months and never had a bad experience.  Staff is always happy and nice.  Bathrooms are clean and like always, coffee is great.  Thanks for making me feel welcome all the time.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~3~Nov 6, 2017~I'm a fan of Starbucks, but this location is a but under par. Slow, messed up my drive through order. They didn't know about Apple Pay. If you have a choice, find another nearby Starbuck. Most are a bit better.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jul 24, 2017~Have been here twice. First time they messed up my order. Second time, my soy latte just had the weirdest after taste. Not sure if it was the beans, if the soy milk was burnt or what it was. Costumer service is also mehhh at best. I'm a loyal gold card member and have been for a few years. I've been to better Starbucks locations... I'll avoid this one in the future.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~May 16, 2019~Always a great experience. Drive thru line can be lengthy during peak times but the flow is great and never a long wait! Love this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Jun 28, 2019~A lot of these people are ridiculous middle-aged people complaining for no reason. I come here all the time and the baristas are some of the nicest people you'll meet if you're nice to them which you should be.If you have work at 8 and you arrive at 7:30 and you see the always backed up drive thru line, maybe don't get in line and then complain about the wait. It's your fault for your poor time management skills karen.I'm a waitress at Olive Garden and it kills me whenever people come in to a sit down restaurant and expect fast food levels of wait times. I get Starbucks is basically fast food, but use your brain people. Starbucks is famous. This particular location is right off the freeway, in a family area, next to a public university, with a demographic that's prone to order frappuccinos.I don't know about the rest of you, but from my seat, I can only see two blenders. Imagine making thousands of frappuccinos a day and there's only one or two people making drinks!? Don't get me wrong, maybe they should hire more people, but as of this moment, the amount of people that are there are the ones that are there and you will treat them with respect.Do you see the amount of druggies and homeless people these 20somethjng managers have to deal with? This is on Starbucks, but they definitely shouldn't have to deal with you peoples bullshit.I'm only writing this because i just witnessed the manager deal with a shitty karen because a BEVERAGE was made wrong. They'll just remake it it's not a big deal. There are kids in cages... Be nice to them and they'll be nice to you. Tip them and maybe they'll be even nicer. Who knows you might make a friend or two karen...
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Dec 4, 2021~Rude customer service @ window right from the start . My drinks were not even made correctly.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~May 15, 2017~Second person in line, pretty dead line for drive thru as well. Nothing complicated but still waited 15 minutes for my drink. No music`~ it's all about the atmosphere. And overall feeling of 'we're Starbucks, we don't have to try'. Dutch Bro's has stolen my heart. And the sales of this establishment.Meh
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jun 23, 2021~If I could give 0 stars I would. I always order ahead and usually it's always ready when I get there but these last few times I have to wait 20 min for a drink? This last time I've about had it. I ordered 3:44 prep time was 5-6 min and I arrived at 3:56 nothing ready I was thirsty okay so I asked for a water it went all the way to 4:06 which made me late for work plus I never got my drink!!! Only the water  I asked for when I arrived. They weren't even busy just standing around waiting for drink orders to come out. I noticed a blender with my drink just sitting there. Workers acted dumb and just mean do I left and called the store they told me to come back for a redemption card and sorry for the inconvenience. once I got off i went and it looked like they were closed but I just wanted to ask what time the manager would be there so I called and they literally looked at me and rolled their eyes and ignored the call , i came up to the window just for the girl to roll her eyes and ignore I was there a guy worker was nice enough to tell me what time but I've never had such a bad experience. As a former Starbucks employee I would of got in big trouble for the inconvenience or at least tried to make a simple grande frappe. Doesn't take more them 4 mins in cold bar.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Dec 29, 2018~This Starbucks sucks!! They are always running out of drinks. How is it possible to run out drink mixes if that's what you're supposed to be selling. Has happened on multiple occasions. And the staff want to get rude afterwards. Would choose no stars if possible.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Mar 4, 2019~Came in the evening to get a quick caffeine boost and there was only 2 cars in front of me in the drive through and it took 15 minutes to finally get to the window. They also were out of venti cups and a few other drink items. Slowest starbucks i've ever been to
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Oct 7, 2021~I got down to there window to order at 7pm they said only drive thru orders or mobile orders cause there lobby was closed, one of there works came in on there day off and they took there order at the window that is very unprofessional if you can't take a paying customers order at the window then you should treat everyone the same the manager stared at the guy doing it and let it happen. never coming here again
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jan 25, 2017~Literally just waited in the drive thru 15-20 mins for 1 coffee. Lots of cars in line with me. Never got an apology at least or a coffee on them for next time I know things happen but man zero zero zero customer service!  Will never return here
Phoenix, AZ 85017~3~Jan 10, 2017~I love when I can update reviews and add stars! I think there might have been a manager change or something, but this Starbucks has improved so much. The service is faster, the employees are nice, and the store is clean.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Dec 7, 2016~This location is convenient because it's a drive through BUT the service makes it hard to want to come back. The baristas are often rude. The place is d i r t y. The one time I decide to give the drive thru a chance, I'm in the line for 30 minutes on a Sunday afternoon.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~May 1, 2019~Love starbucks, this location isn't the best. Lack of customer service, lack of care for drinks actually being good. Came in for my bday drink and their button wasn't popping up even though I hadn't redeemed it yet &amp; my birthday was clearly correct on the app... so i didn't get it. I miss the employees that were there a few months ago. Have had bad experiences lately, with wrong drinks, wrong sizes, cups full of ice when ordering light ice etc... love starbucks in general but idk whats up with this one specifically.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Mar 24, 2019~This location specifically has not gave us our order correctly every time I've gone there.  They forget items in our order . I order a specific drink for my wife she likes the berry habiscus refresher with lemonade and add dried strawberries. My wife is usually working when I go so I get her it and put it aside for her to come home to and enjoy after a long day. What does she come home to ? A drink she's not able to enjoy. They forget to put lemonade all the time. It's very upsetting to know that I'm not able to depend on them to help with a good drink .
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Feb 22, 2019~I visit Starbucks all over the world. This location has to be one of the poorest examples. Though they remain constantly busy I frequently see one or two employees either talking or goofing around rather than waiting on clients. Cream and sugar are continually out and I personally have had to go searching in the bins myself to replenish supplies. This morning they were out of both Venti and grande cups. All they could offer was the tall and a weak `"sorry`". It's quite evident that management at this store is failing during the morning shift. I will be finding a different route to work and a different Starbucks to go to.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jun 16, 2021~This Starbucks location is not competent at all. I mobile ordered this morning and came through the drive through. They made me back out and go around. Then I watched everyone in the drive through after where I was leave before me. And when I got my drink, it was wrong. This is not the first bad experience I've had at this Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Jan 10, 2018~Katy and Norma are seriously the best. They just make the experience so much better and quicker! I enjoy being helped by them because of their positive energy and their good customer service. Coffee is perfect, as always!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Sep 23, 2018~By far this is the worst Starbucks I been too :( and I am a loyal Starbucks costumer.  The barista has not too friendly I asked her for a Bacon Gouda and she said we don't have that, okay give me a chocolate croissant and she said I don't have that. There were 3 cars ahead of me and I waited in line 15 minutes. Damn. This was quite a disappointment luckily I don't live around here and I will never be coming back.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~May 23, 2021~Horrible. I waited for almost 30 minutes in the drive thru and then got turned away because they were understaffed. The girl was just standing outside staring at her phone. A heads up would've been great instead of wasting my time. Worst experience at a Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Oct 7, 2018~The service was fast and smooth, it was easy to order and go. Stay thirsty my friends
Phoenix, AZ 85017~4~Jan 7, 2017~Spiced Sweet Cream Cold Brew - pretty goodService - good
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Oct 29, 2018~I have been there a few times and I love this Starbucks. Its close to GCU and they must hire the students, they treat you wonderfully and are kind, patient and thoughtful. Great place to make your​ neighborhood coffee place.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~May 24, 2021~Best Starbucks! Super homey looking place, the staff is super nice, and they manage surprisingly well for how popular the location is
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Aug 23, 2018~The worse service ever lady gave me attitude the whole time and wouldn't give me a receipt
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jul 14, 2019~Went through drive thru and the lady who was taking my order was really rude. She asked me what I wanted and disappeared for 7mins leaving me talking by myself she came back to take my order and did not even say sorry like she did to the previous individual. Worst customer service I added something else and she left someone else had to take over her job unbelievable never coming back
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jun 6, 2016~Horrible customer service.Ghetto attitude to match the ghetto neighborhood it's in. Very dirty with trash and flys everywhere outside.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Dec 1, 2019~I just had the worst experience at Starbucks on Bethany and 35 th in Phoenix. I purchased $25 in coffees and after being charged the coffee I asked for extra soy milk was given to me half empty and I nicely asked if I can have my cup filled to the top with soy milk mind you Im here all the time order the same drink everytime,  and I pay the same amount  for my drink. When I asked if my cup could be filled to the top, the tall heavy set light skin guy told me no because that's a latte and I told him I wasn't told that when I made my order and paid for my drinks. He ignored me for about 3 min straight and when I asked another guy if he could help me he told him NO, and turned to me and said I'm not filling that cup up with soy milk until you pay for it. He also said the girl who charged me is new and this lady who was behind me hearing all of this mentioned that the cashier girl was not new because she's also been going there for some time too. The tall rude employee then takes my coffee and walks to the register and tells the customers waiting in line if they could step aside because he going to charge me. All this unnecessary attitude and non sense for $1.30 he charged for a splash of extra soy milk. Never again will I be coming to this Starbucks. Worse customer service ever.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Dec 22, 2019~To start I would say that I have spent many a dollar at Starbucks, so much so that the baristas at the Starbucks by work know me by name. Today like so many other days I place a mobile order, 10 mins later I arrive at this location and didn't see my drink. I waited another 5 mins before I asked a gentleman named Isaac if they had received my order, without even looking he assured me that they did. Another 10 mins passes by and I asked another barista if my order was coming up. She let me know they didn't have my order. I asked to speak to the manger, to my surprise it was Isaac. He then preceded to give me some bs story about how they were busy. I never got an answer to why he didn't check if they had my order and never even offered a refund. I had to ask for a refund on something I never got. This is by far the worst customer service I've gotten at a Starbucks. I know that I'm just one customer and they probably won't miss my business but I will never go to this location again!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jan 4, 2021~Did a mobile order so you know I won't have to wait in line. And turns out if we ordered mobile we have to go through the Drive-through my Oder say ready by6:13 it's 6:19 and the lady over the intercom says it's not ready yet by the time I get to the window my drink SHOULD BE READY! Wtf come on now it's pointless to order mobile to be in and out if u have customers going through the drive through that's what we want to avoid. What sucks is I waited this long and my drink was terrible I didn't even want it. Shame Starbucks update it's 6:30 still no drink
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~May 17, 2015~We messed up and did not give the app for the free drink, so they credit our free on the app and let us keep the free drink for next time!    That is customer service when we messed up!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~May 25, 2016~Definetively the worst drive thru service of any Starbucks in Phoenix Area !!!! Way too slow and always packed !!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jun 23, 2020~This might be the slowest service I have ever received at any Starbucks anywhere!!! I had 4 cars ahead of me and sat in line for 30 minutes. Absolutely ridiculous
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Oct 11, 2018~Friendly staff and busy. I wish more employees were as good as the gals at 35th ave. Bethany. NICE WORK
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Jun 19, 2017~I come here with my family almost every day to every other day and the staff here know us by name. They are great people who love to make us happy! I love this starbucks. It's the only one I go to and I'll continue to go here!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Jul 12, 2017~Great service. Staff is always helpful even though they are very busy every time i go in. Coffee is always fresh. Only thing I dislike is the price but that's a corporate concern. Drive thru is always fast. One time I was ordering early in the morning and wasn't awake yet, the lady taking my order guessed my drink and I didn't have to say anymore. That is great service to me. Can't wait to go back.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Jan 21, 2018~I have been stoping for my coffee at this location for over 5 years! Stop about 3 times a week and everyone is always super friendly and kind. Hot Chia Tea is my go to drink for a long work week!! Line is super fast and I go i and out in no time!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jun 20, 2019~Horrible experience again! If management knows that Starbucks gets busy on happy hour why not schedule extra people and stock up on cups, whip cream, caramel etc. Also, all of the workers need to work on their customer service, working when being mad and throwing drinks at customers is not fair for us. We go to consume and get good service not horrible like what myself and all of the other customers got today. This is one of the crapiest Starbucks I have ever been to): if someone can better the store and workers  ASAP that would be amazing!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~4~May 23, 2014~I go 2 `"StarF*cks`" once in a blue moon or so 4 an iced caramel macchiatto or during holiday seasonal eggnog chai rel8ed drinks/teas which is probably a good thing cuz let's face it, as good as certain things may taste `~ most items r'nt good 4 ur health or waistline.    I personally suggest nixing on the `"CRAP`~uccino's`" @ this loc8ion tho, any1 I've ever come w/ who's partaken of any were disappointed in the sour bitter after`~taste (unless that's ur preference). SomeXs they come up w/ some tasty Veg`~head alter8ive items here on their menu like: spinach tomato ciabatta or tomato croissant pastry that tastes almost like pizza, just wish they would offer these type items on a more regular instead of temporary basis.   I usually go thru the drive`~up window &amp; have only been inside a couple Xs, each of those setting off my claustrophobia as it's a very confined space here &amp; spills/mishaps r frequent. Can only imagine the mayhem when slammin'/maximum capacity.  No thx, keepin' w/ the drive`~thru whenever I go even if it moves snail pace during higher influx periods. Besides there's Sonic tables right next door 2 sit @ away from the chaos, confusion &amp; deafening noise. SB do have some tables outside but they're very limited &amp; 2 close 2 all that hustle/bustle 2 converse.   Most Xs all the baristas service is accur8, friendly &amp; accomod8ing tho there have been a couple occasions when inside, I noticed some p8ient patrons getting frustr8ed w8ing 4ever 4 their orders (or lack`~there`~of) lost perhaps or maybe a new employee in training? I've not had a bad experience tho myself in all the occasions I've frequented other than not caring 4 the uncomfortable interior @ this locale so I'll still frequent here, just not very regularly... unless they start offering some healthier &amp; make some Veg options more available, but still a pretty good place!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~3~Sep 1, 2010~Here's the thing... New Starbucks for me near GCU campus... Not the best neighborhood .. But all Starbucks are equal? I think not. This Starbucks has super friendly baristas, but super bitter cappucinos... Tables weren't clean.. But in their defense, the place was packed with students milling in &amp; out the whole 2 hours I sat there mulling through some very dry reading .. On second thought, maybe it's a good idea to have stronger Capp than normal..
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Sep 4, 2017~Woke up in the mood for some coffee. I decided to go with my cousin through the drive thru. The cashier was very short, no eye contact and in addition didn't have active listening skills. We gave her dollar bills and told her to wait because we had the change ( we didn't want more change ) she ignored us and when she came back we told her we had the change and she said it was too late. Then she gives us our order and she forgets one of our drinks. She doesn't apologize for forgetting our drink. Once she gives us our drink she doesn't say anything to us but hands us our drink. I've gone to plenty of Starbucks and they are usually very friendly , helpful and all around pleasant. I don't appreciate starting my morning off like this when Im on vacation and all I wanted was to enjoy my coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~4~Dec 15, 2017~I love Starbucks, any location I go to it's always great service and friendly people. But I did notice that whenever I do go to this location the employees seem like they don't wanna be there and have a bit of an attitude.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jun 23, 2021~this is literally the worst starbucks ive ever been to. i go to school across the street so i usually try to order ahead, but theyre online ordering is ALWAYS unavailable. then if it is working...it takes 30 minutes to actually get my drink. they always close down randomly, theyre always out of food items, and they NEVER fill my drinks up further than about 3/4 of the way. so annoying
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jan 8, 2020~I am floored.  I was almost arrested today for sitting outside this location for about 10 minutes.I am a regular patron to various Starbucks around phoenix and have never had a problem.  At my first time to this store I was harassed by security and the police were called on me.  I was out riding my bike enjoying the beautiful warm day today and stopped at Starbucks (BIG mistake apparently).  I was sitting at an outdoor table contemplating what drink I wanted to get.  A security guard pulls up and comes straight toward me and asked if I was sleeping (I was wearing a hat so perhaps he couldn't tell).  I said no I'm not.  He said are you going to go in an buy something?  I said that I wasn't sure why that mattered.  He said `"So you want to play that game huh?`"  I was shocked as I remember the CEO committing to tolerance.  Apparently this manager didn't get the memo.  I then overheard the security guard calling police and describing my appearance.  It is absolutely appalling that someone can't even take a seat without worrying that the cops will come and arrest you for trespassing at Starbucks.  Unbelievable.  This is the most intolerant store I have ever experienced.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Jun 6, 2019~I never realy leave reviews but just had to with the experience I just had. Asked the lady in the drive thru just now to make me a drink (any frappuccino of her choice) at random because I simply want to try new drinks. After explaining to her that the only item I want in the drink is almond milk, I pulled up to the window and was provided a nice friendly service. It was a funny experience and something new for me but honestly props to the associate who was at the window, she was really kind and really wanted me to try the drink before driving off (I didnt bc I wanted to fully taste it and not in a rush since the drive thru was packed). I'm aiming to start heading to this location more often now.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Dec 30, 2018~I have no choice but to come to this Starbucks because it's the closest to my home/work. Let me first off and say there's ALWAYS a long line due to the staff are very slow and taking orders &amp; making orders. Also they ALWAYS run out of drinks, I asked for a regular hot brew coffee and they didn't even have coffee brewing ( it's a Starbucks how do you not have coffee brewing ) . I highly wont recommend this Starbucks to anybody. Sorry not sorry ‍
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jul 31, 2016~This is the slowest drive thru ever! 2 days ago I was waiting in line for 34 minutes, I learned my lesson and never went back, never again.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Mar 16, 2018~Oh I completely love Starbucks, can't go a day without it!!!! Every morning I brew my self a cup of coffee lol!, but at this Starbucks workers are super nice even though they are fairy usually busy.. I ordered a cinnamon macchiato it was fabulous
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Nov 16, 2019~By far the worst Starbucks location... I've given chance after chance but every time I am disappointed. I specifically say no whip cream (and it says so on my drink label) but for some reason they always put whip!! Today I waited 30 minutes for one frappe, that of course had whip cream. So frustrating when you have places to be and just want a quick drink!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Jan 21, 2017~This is not the same Starbucks I walked into 6 months ago.  I believe they did get a new manager and he obviously knows how customer service should be.  This place has completely changed.  Better customer service.  Less wait time.  Delicious drinks and charged appropriately.  Well done!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Oct 8, 2016~Waited about 20 min in the drive through and when pulled up to the front to order out me on hold then forgot about me for 5 min. In a hurry don't come to this Starbucks. If you know you're understaffed then should hire more employees.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~May 12, 2017~This Starbucks is conveniently located right across the street from where I work. The efficiency of the drive through has greatly improved in recent months. Additionally, there is a man who I believe his name is Michael... he is absolutely delightful in the mornings. Full of energy and enthusiasm. I am so glad he is there to hand me my drinks because there is nothing worse than a Debbie downer at 8am!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Aug 6, 2016~I usually go to this location out of convenience but i do not recommend it! They always have and extra charge for a drink i get that i never get charged anywhere else. They constantly give me regular milk when i order soy i cannot drink regular otherwise I wouldn't mind but they are super rude about it every time they do that.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jul 11, 2019~I've never given a review but literally downloaded yelp Just to review my horrible experience from yesterday. This is a long story but I'm so mad that I'll sit down and so it ! I've been to this Starbucks two times before yesterday, for some reason the same drink that I always order (in many diff Starbucks ) all taste the same but in this specific location it doesn't, it can't be the coffee because  it should be the same so I'm not sure if they don't use the almond milk like I asked or idk what it is but I wanted to give it another chance and still went again because I thought `"maybe it's just me, maybe it's in my head `" ... so I go in the drive through like always and first off the girl taking my order gave me some sort of attitude but I thought `"you know... we all have bad days so she might be having one`" didn't make a big deal i ordered said thank you and proceeded to pay. When I go to the window she ignores me, asks for my card takes it and moves away from window (when usually Starbucks workers are nice and greet you ) but again I ignored it and didn't think much of it. However when they hand me my drink it was completely overfilled leaking everywhere.. simply a mess but she stills hands me my drink probably thinking I won't notice or say anything so she gives my drink and turns around right away to take an order (literally trying to avoid the problem ) now keep in mind I'm on my way to work with scrubs, so the minute I move  this drink inside it'll spill everywhere on me so I sit there to ask for a napkin, of course I had to sit there for like a minute because she was probably hoping I'd leave , the barista noticed me and probably felt embarrassed since he probably made the drink, so he tells the girl to turn around towards me. I wasn't rude didn't say anything (trying to be positive here) and ask for napkins while holding the drink out the window so they can see this horrible mess. She hands me 2 napkins and again rushes to run away from window. 2 freaking napkins to clean a overly filled Drink that's leaking everywhere like you gotta be kidding me ! I could have returned my drink for another but I didn't, so with my hand still out I managed to drive and park with my other hand. I went inside (again didn't say anything - I could have made a scene but tbh didn't have the time since I had to go to work ) so I go in ask for a new lid ask for napkins and cleaned it myself right in front of the barista And everyone while they just stared. The girl the noticed me and asked the barista `"what's wrong why is she here `" he literally said `"nothings wrong `" even tho he made this drink he hands me the lid he sees me cleaning and nothing is wrong ?! How about you do your job ! Never once did they offer to help or apologized no nothing and I mean why would they right ? they don't care they're just teenagers who work there idk but they clearly don't care about customer service ! Never have I experienced that in a Starbucks! Usually everyone is nice friendly and care about customers so if you don't care about customer service and don't mind if your drink sometimes taste good or sometimes doesn't then this is your place to go otherwise just drive a few miles further to find another Starbucks because this place is just not worth it !
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Apr 25, 2016~Went there with my boyfriend last night, they refused to serve us because they had already closed the lobby, but yet they didn't even lock the doors!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Dec 4, 2016~If I can give this store 0 starts that's what it would be .. so Disappointed The manager on duty her name was Courtney and she was no help at all even when I expressed how upset I was all she could do was look at me and blank this is the last Starbucks I will ever go to sadly you honestly can't even get what u paid for
Phoenix, AZ 85017~3~Sep 14, 2016~It's a little dirty but speed of service has improved. It's the closes coffee shop to my house and it provides a good atmosphere to get homework done. It does the job, nothing extraordinary.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Oct 14, 2016~Dirty, painfully slow and sometimes their espresso machine doesn't work. Dunkin Donuts is a better choice.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Aug 26, 2016~Very slow service. They need more people. Our order was skipped and people who were behind us got their drinks before us.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Nov 6, 2014~I have been an avid Starbucks customer for many many years now, and I have traveled to Starbucks locations all across the country on business.As this location is close to where I work, I am forced to frequent it often. It has consistently been slow and the customer service is often as ghetto as the neighborhoods which surround it. This morning, I waited 20 minutes in line and found out that this is the ONLY Starbucks in the country that won't grind a bag of coffee beans because it is not Starbucks coffee.Well Starbucks, you've lost one more customer. I won't be visiting this location again.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~May 20, 2016~Nope.  Nope.  I've been too kind about this place.  Their drive-thru is bad. (7:30 p.m.)  They only had 4 employees working but today the wait was over 15+ mins!  I could hear the car in front saying they messed up their order too... and you have to check since you've waited this long.  They were still mixing my drink when we got to the window.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~3~May 10, 2016~Caroline rushed us through our order today... so we kept it short and didnt order everything we came for.  Other times we've had good service from the drive thru but the staff hardly looks happy to be here.  At least the drinks are always on point.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Aug 26, 2016~17 min just for two Iced Caramel Macchiatos, they are extremely slow and understaffed
Phoenix, AZ 85017~4~Mar 18, 2017~I love this Starbucks. The staff at this location are always pleasant and prioritize getting your order correctly. Though, they are always packed! I rarely wait in the drive thru for less than 10-15 minutes. When I am in a rush, it can be disappointing, but I have ordered ahead a few times and it's ready by the time I arrive. Really nice location with lots of indoor and outdoor seating!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~May 25, 2016~By far the SLOWEST Starbucks in the valley. I don't come here often but always wait 20 monutes, even at non peak hours. Currently waiting as I type, took 14 minutes to even order! Two stars for friendly service.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~May 8, 2016~This Starbucks is forever slow... All three times we've been here we've waited on average 8 minutes for one drink. (6 minutes the first time, 10 minutes the second time and 10 minutes the 3rd time)... The staff isn't the most helpful and friendly either. If there's another one near by go there.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Dec 17, 2016~Horrible experience and will never go back to this location. Waiting nearly 20 min for your coffee is ridiculous
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jun 13, 2015~Worst Starbucks ever. I ordered a Valencia orange refresher made with green tea instead of water on my way to work this morning, got the refresher made without water and without green tea, got charged for the tea I didn't get and I couldn't even finish the drink.  The drink they made me was just straight refresher concentrate it was super acidic, ridiculously sweet and it was by far the worst drink I have ever had at a Starbucks and the longest wait I've ever had to endure at a drive-thru. I will NEVER be going to this Starbucks again.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~3~Jan 20, 2016~I went through the drive thru expecting it to be fast but it took forever (about 12 minutes) to get my drink and croissant. My order was right but I'm curious to why it took so long. Either the cars in front of me ordered a lot or ordered really complicated orders and kept having them fix it. Who Knows. Otherwise decent Starbucks near school!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Feb 20, 2016~For many years, the `"Slowest Starbucks in The World`" title-holder was held by the store outside of Ft. Leonard Wood (aka Lost in the Woods) but this store has eclipsed them thanks to their ill-trained staff and store's unique ability to attract customers who have never ordered a cup of coffee before.. During my wait counted at least seven people who just walked away.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~4~Dec 12, 2015~A decent cup of coffee like all the other stores.  Friendly staff and it is always nice to get a consistent cup o'joe.  I always get a mocha skinny no whip.  I also have the phone app which is an easy way to pay.  It was able to get in and out in a short time.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Aug 10, 2018~Unfortunately I need write a review because this Starbucks really needs to improve and I hope corporate takes action. Aside from a few drinks that have been wrong and slow lines, what's lacking at this location is the customer service. They are openly rude when you ask for your drink remade or even what comes in a drink. They will take your drink, smell it and look at each other as if you're a liar like they did with me. The baristas seem annoyed to serve you as a customer. I have been a barista and manager for over 14 years and this Starbucks in my opinion needs either new management or a new team to check their attitudes while on the job.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Aug 23, 2017~My grandma and I went to Starbucks for a simple coffee treat. Only to have rude Justin ruin our time. Without a smile he huffed and puffed while taking our order and my grandma made a simple mistake of ordering the wrong thing and even though she OFFERED to pay for it Justin and the other two girl baristas made comments under their breath while one of them slammed the replacement on the table. While Justin slammed everything like the blender and cabinets the whole time he made the drink. Shame on you Justin. You suck and you're pathetic.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~3~Oct 9, 2013~This Starbucks is the same as every other Starbucks out there. OK service, OK Coffee, OK price considering the fact that EVERYONE overcharges for Coffee! It gets the job done when I'm on the go.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~May 9, 2015~I ordered a grande iced Americano and I waited 8 minutes for my drink inside the store! I know an expression shot over ice doesn't take more than 2 minutes to be completed. Slowest Starbucks around. Long lines out the door and drive thru isn't any faster. Multiple people are always waiting by the beverage pick up bar grunting with frustration because this Starbucks is so slow. Don't stop here if you're in a hurry. You'll be late! I've been here over 5 times and they have not changed my mind at all about service timing.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Feb 11, 2016~This Starbucks always takes FOREVER to get you your drinks. Especially in the drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Feb 16, 2012~This location was great. They were quick friendly and helpful. They are cheaper than most locations, but probably because they are technically in the hood.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Dec 1, 2015~How does this Starbucks always run out of stuff???? There have been times I can't even get the cup size I want because they're out of cups??? Go figure!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Mar 26, 2015~For being a picky customer, I'm overall satisfied. The drive thru was quick and didn't have to wait so long as I do at the other Starbucks, and they also had great customer service
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jan 6, 2016~Worst Starbucks in AZ. They ask for your name but never call it when your drink is ready. My drink was ready for 5 mins. When I found out it was stting there and she was proud to tell me that it was ready 5 minutes ago. Won't be coming back, losers!!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Apr 9, 2014~I go here often because it is close by.  It is by far NOT my favorite location.  The staff is friendly and all that.  BUT what is the deal with paper....I am NEVER given a napkin when I order food.  It is now. a game for me....I order.  If I do not get a napkin I absolutely do not tip.  I think tipping a drive thru for a basic item is ridiculous anyway....but when you cannot give me a napkin, FORGET IT.  Another paper issue...receipts wth don't you offer a receipt for every order?????  I pay cash. For a period of time I was in a situation where I could submit my receipts for reimbursement, I hate having to remember to ask for a receipt..  I lost quite a bit of money because of this.  I called their corporate...and know that there was no order from above to withhold receipts and napkins.  Its the little things that can be so annoying or make someone's day.  Smile and give someone ordering a food item a friggen napkin.  Is that tooo much to ask?  FYI...this napkin withholding occurs morning/noon/night.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~4~Mar 24, 2015~Great Coffee AND Great personal. I enjoy going to this bethany home starbucks. The employees serve the sandwiches hot and warm. Super delicious! Thank you starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Jul 3, 2011~I'm not into goofy coffee houses, coffee is coffee, but my wife likes them. I do no about customer service though, and these people snap at you for asking questions and you better now what you want before walking in the door. Avoid this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Mar 3, 2015~Super friendly service but place was dirty on a Saturday night with only 4 other people in the place. Place needs some comfy seats not just hard wooden type.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Aug 4, 2015~Idk why you other yelp opinions are so...anyways this Starbucks is amazing. Every time I go in they ask about my day and always make me laugh. Wonderful Starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Nov 1, 2016~Worst Starbucks I have ever been too. Drinks taste nothing like they are supposed to. Terrible customer service. The other day one of the employees came in after smoking a cigarette, watched her come in, not wash her hands and put a lid on my drink. The whole lid stunk of cigarettes. Another time an employee acted completely rude when I had asked for a green tea and replied saying `"we don't have green tea`" just because I didn't say `"emperor's cloud and mist green tea`". Terrible customer service when asking anything at all and I'm never one to care enough to write reviews.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jan 11, 2013~They have me the wrong size drink and the cup was covered in caramel. Thanks!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~May 17, 2013~Love my Pikes brew but have been to several  SB's lately who have been slack in keeping the creamer filled and the coffee condiment area stocked and cleaned. My main complaint today...when I asked for creamer after purchasing my java I am made to wait because they have already sold me my coffee and my importance rating as a customer then drops to zero! By the time I get creamer from the surly barrista who acted like I was bugging her my coffee is cool enough that adding cold creamer made it tepid at best. New tactic suggestion folks....check out the station on the way to the counter and demand your creamer at the counter when you get your coffee or suffer the quincEquences!! (made up word). Thanks
Phoenix, AZ 85017~3~Oct 22, 2012~I went through the drive thru and it took a while. Expected it to be quicker than the delay I expierenced.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~3~Apr 11, 2013~I think the only perk of this place may be the drive thru. I mean, the service is pretty okay but they are kind of messy. Your cup almost always has cream on it. I don't know if they don't see it or just don't care. I don't know about you but I don't like to grab milk when I'm reaching for my coffee. Some days are better than others and it's usually pretty busy with people chillin' or working.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Aug 17, 2017~This is by far my favorite Starbucks. Great service, everyone is super friendly especially Fatima. Plus they always clean my cup when they spill other Starbucks locations rarely do that. Keep up the great work.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jun 30, 2017~Online order and come to find out no extra cream like I asked and two of the drinks I ordered are half empty. I paid too much for these to be half empty. Terrible!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Aug 18, 2016~Very poorly managed. Each time I have been there, it's been at least a ten minute wait and they aren't that busy. They have to remake drinks frequently. Staff could use more training.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Apr 24, 2016~No matter what time of day it is, it always takes more than 15 minutes just to get a drink at the Drive thru! Don't go if you're in a hurry. You'll be stuck in line for the longest time!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Sep 1, 2014~Luis is great!  Lots of awesome employees.  This Starbucks is close too home but that's not the only reason I frequent it alot!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jul 29, 2016~Slowest Starbucks on the planet, like to the point where you just want to give up on life. By the time you realize you're never going to get served, you're boxed in the drive thru and you just have to sit there and suffer.  Then when you reach the window, you get to wait again after receiving your Luke warm greeting.  Why do I come here?!?
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Feb 13, 2013~Walked in, they greeted me with a smile. I told them my drink and they got it out quick. Opened after a nice remodel. 5 stars!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Apr 6, 2014~Very disappointed with my order, first it took 15 minutes to get my order and then when I got my order my coffee ( caramel frappuchino) was so nasty and didn't even taste good, it was all melted and lacked taste. Do not recommend going there.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Feb 27, 2016~I'm going to make this short, if you are running short on time and you see a some what long line on the drive thru, don't go through it! I've gone through the drive thru at least 3 times already and they take at least 15 minutes! The one star is for the coffee since they seem to make it better than other Starbucks locations. That's why I still go to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~5~Aug 6, 2016~I have been a Starbucks gold member for about 6 years &amp; I love it! I get free drinks all the time &amp; they always make my drink just the way I like it. The drive thru line was long, but they were able to speed it up and have the line shorten in a short amount of time! They made my morning!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jun 17, 2016~Worst Starbucks drive-thru ever! 17 min wait ! The orders in front of me were small and simple just like mine I do not understand why it took long!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~Sep 4, 2015~Only giving two stars considering my coffee was ok. As for service, they must not notice you can see their face while they take your order! The lady was making faces and mimicking my voice and had no idea I could see her! I only wish I recorded her to show her managers!
Phoenix, AZ 85017~2~May 9, 2017~On my last visit here a girl named Norma was working the drive thru window and was extremely rude. I understand sometimes it's hard not to give a customer an attitude when they're being rude to you, but that was not the case. I work at a coffee shop so when I visit other shops I try to be as kind to the staff as possible. I was astonished by the amount of attitude she gave me when I told her my friends and were paying separately for our drinks, such a simple thing that she was so bothered by. Then she handed me my drinks and one didn't have the lid on right and spilled in my car. She had already walked away so I waited for her to come back so I could ask for napkins and she saw me waiting and kept ignoring me and even though there were cars behind me she had to attend. When she finally came back to the window she just looked at me really annoyed and said nothing until I spoke. I've never taken the to write a review but I was really annoyed by this. Love this shop, just bad experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~3~Jun 18, 2013~Coffee was good. Raspberry swirl load was stale.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Mar 31, 2015~Worst starbucks. They make the drinks horrible and constantly get the order wrong. Threw out both drinks the otherday because they didnt use soy (dont drink dairy) and the other one was to sweet and had no coffee taste. The employees are no good and cant make drinks. They need to train them right. Lazy careless employees. Waste of money. Would give zero stars.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jul 25, 2015~I always have to wait at least 15 minutes whether in the cafe or the drive through. There is no sense of urgency in this location at all. Very disappointing. The only reason I come to this store is because it's so close to where I work.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Aug 29, 2014~This has to be the worst Starbucks in the valley. They are not fast at all. I've never made it through the drive-through in under 15 min and I only get a iced coffee nothing special. I understand once or twice this might happen bit this is a everyday thing. Someone needs to show this Starbucks how to run good service it's just unacceptable. Starbucks as a company is better than this.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~3~Mar 18, 2015~The third star was only because the coffee is good. The service is terrible here. I've been in the drive thru at least twice now and it has taken over 10+ minutes and that was being the 3rd or 4th car in line. I don't think that's acceptable for the money it costs. Speed it up and I would be more likely to come back daily.
Phoenix, AZ 85017~1~Jun 18, 2015~Just because it on my way to work and in a hurry for coffee otherwise I would never step my foot in! Every time I'm here I got the worse experience. The staff and manager are soooooo rude. I ordered an expresso I specifically ask to have my whip cream up-side-down, the staff look at me like I'm weird or stuff and said `"I don't understand`".. What's!?!? I got this drink ordered tons where else and they all got it right! Also, another time I was here I was waited and waited for my drink everyone else whom order behind me got there drinks and left, I went up and ask `"excuse me, I've been here awhile and hasn't got my drink yet and everyone else who behind me got there drink?`" And the manager come up to me and rudely ask `"who? Who, got the drink before you?`" I was horrify. Of course they all left with there drinks! Worse worse Starbucks ever!!!!! If there's a negative stars on review this Starbucks gonna get it!!!!
Glendale, AZ 85301~3.7~(302 reviews)~Fast service! I ordered a ham and Swiss croissant and a triple iced espresso with oat milk and two pumps of white chocolate mocha. The ham in the croissant was slightly thicker than usual and it was super cheesy! I picked up my order through the drive thru the first time. The second time I was able to pick up my drink at the pick up window. This location has mobile order parking spaces right in front.
Glendale, AZ 85301~5~Sep 28, 2024~I was excited to come to a closer location but with the last couple times I have come here, I'm more than happy to drive the extra 10 mins to the one on 59th Ave and Olive. I mobile ordered 15 mins ahead of time for 6 drinks. I get there and have to wait for one of the girls working to acknowledge me. Mind you the pick up window is glass so you can see out it and I smiled a 2 girls and they smiled back. NO ONE came to the window. I waited for a few mins. Whatever they in the zone. Finally someone came and I gave the name and she said the last one is being made right now. I say okay. I waited and another person came out and asked what I'm waiting on and I tell her one more drink and she said `"okay it's being made right now`". I wait 15 more mins for a single grande coffee. Finally someone else comes up to do pick up and I ask again when they come back, I'm still waiting I tell them. She tells me that there are no more drinks that she gave them to me already. I say no I have 5 now and waiting for the last one. She gets my name. THE COFFEE HAS BEEN DONE AND WAITING AT THE PICK UP WINDOW SINCE I GOT MY FIRST ROUND OF DRINKS. I understand accidents but for two baristas to tell me `"it's being made`" in a span of the 15-18 mins I was waiting. Unacceptable. I was late for work and coffee was cold by the time I got to work. If you want baristas that avoid the pick up window, avoid helping customers, and don't check their orders, come to this location. Feedback for the owner: a new system needs to be in place for the baristas so they know where they should be and who does what. One at window, couple at machines, one assigned pick up window. They need to all check all windows regularly. Don't need them to have a `"it's not my job`" mindset. They are a team and should act like a team.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Oct 29, 2024~Thank you to the sweet barista for making my bday drink so special!!  they even gave me some cute bday sprinkles. I haven't had any Starbucks in over a year but i had to get my free drink
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~Dec 12, 2024~It's not the staff (super friendly) or the ambiance (cozy) but the crazy cost of Mint Tea that's got me shook.  $4.09 for a medium hot tea.  It's a bag and some hot water!! What am I paying for? The cup? While cute...I'll bring my own next time if that cuts the cost.
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~May 12, 2021~The service is great...don't get me wrong...but I've never heard a staff of baristas speak faster than this. It's auctioneer level. I didn't if I should be impressed or annoyed. And listen, I run from Dutch Because I can't stand all the `"HEY THERE....`" over the loud EDM music. Joking aside. Service is fine. You'll get your order eventually and while they all talk to each other about what Saturday night was like...I'm not complaining because it amuses me.
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Oct 27, 2024~This used to be the best Starbucks to go sit with a nice coffee and get work down. However, recently they removed the ability to plug in your devices from over half their plugs! Now, there's literally only one spot to sit comfortably to work and there's always a homeless man sitting there. He doesn't even buy anything from Starbucks and he sits there all the time using the plugs!If you want to sit comfortably with a coffee to get work done, go somewhere else! or bring a portable charger.
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Nov 10, 2024~The workers here are nice but this Starbucks is beyond slow I don't understand sometimes... they're more worried about the drive through line.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Sep 10, 2024~I had a great experience the other day with one of the employees her name is Terra, she was fast,  nice and finished my order with no complications. Thank you for hiring such an amazing employee.
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~Aug 7, 2023~So excited, no one in line.. I ordered a vanilla iced latte she repeated it back clear as day, but before driving a way i decided to try it.. iykyk.. low and behold it was off, I asked for another pump of vanilla she was kind and handed me a cup w/ vanilla in it, I mixed it in &amp; perfect! As I drove away I looked at my little order sticker, someone forgot to punch in the vanilla part.  just sip your drink before driving away has become my new rule
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Sep 4, 2023~Venti skinny vanilla LATTE. Asked if I wanted cream, I didn't want whipped cream. It's a latte, but came as only coffee, burnt coffee. Waste of hard earned money!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Sep 30, 2020~Starbucks is always my first choice in coffee! Just wanted to share my appreciation for this location. I often order pickup here and it's always ready and made correctly. Recently I ordered a Carmel macchiato with blonde espresso- for some reason wasn't the best today, tasted very milky versus espresso tasting. I'm thinking it was a off day. Starbucks is usually 98% perfect, so it never stops me from continuing to go. I also appreciate that they have changed the lids and hopefully less people are using straws. (Eco friendly nerd) :)
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Dec 16, 2022~If I could give this bitch a zero, I would.Worst service possible. A bunch of idiots that work here.Store Manager and District Manager has got to go.Wrote concerns to corporate and heard nothing back.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~May 6, 2023~Absolutely disgusting... I don't understand the Starbucks hype. My espresso was so burnt that it overpowered the entire frapp-- the burnt espresso was the only thing I could taste-- strike one. And it was so sweet when I specifically said half sweet-- strike two. The only reason I stopped in was to redeem my points that were getting ready to expire-- which also, who does that?! None of my other point apps that I participate in expire-- strike three. I'm so lucky I didn't pay for it but it left such a bad taste in my mouth (literally) that I will not be returning. You're better off going to Coffee Bean, Black Rock, or Dutch. Yes, Dutch is better and that's something I never thought I'd say in my life. Save your time and money and go get yourself a quality treat from literally anywhere else.
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Jan 24, 2019~Great Starbucks! Really spacious inside! Love the Caramel Frappuccino. Also the white chocolate mocha is good. If your a Starbucks member they always have dashes to get extra Starbucks points. Also they have happy hour after 2 or 3 there's either buy 1 drink get one free or half off drinks. They always change it up. This location has a drive thru
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Jul 13, 2022~Did an app order for a pickup and had someone from the office grab the drinks. My Cold Brew tastes like Apple Juice.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Oct 20, 2023~wow i can't believe they thought this was okay to give me. it was hard as a rock to. looks like i'm not eating this morning. very disappointing.
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Aug 24, 2022~Fast, nice employees. I mainly try to do mobile pick ups but if you catch the drive thru at the right time and same goes for inside to order, it's not too bad. Never an issue with my drink being wrong here and usually pretty quick and out the door
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~Feb 1, 2018~Try the Strawberries and Cream Frappacino. It is not on the menu, but do ask for it. It is almost a milkshake, but has a nice light texture. If you want something lighter, try the Very Berry Hibiscus. It was very refreshing.I checked out the sandwiches, but I thought they were a little overpriced.I loved the decor and vibe. Like all other Starbucks, they have  free Wi-Fi.
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~Jul 13, 2021~Came through the drive through thru this afternoon for a quick cold brew fix. There was no line which I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered my usual and picked it up at the window. Even though it was fast there was little to no interaction a little hello goes a long way.
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Apr 1, 2020~I have been a fan of this location since they opened.Was first intrigued by their cutting edge (vs. other locations) offerings. They were on of the first to offer tapas style plates and wine.The vibe inside is very positive, and any time I managed to score one of the two very comfortable, oversized leather chairs I was extremely content and productive.Other seating was fairly uncomfortable, usually avoid it if possible, very hard.Went through the drive thru yesterday and they were friendly, efficient and accurate
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Nov 29, 2019~I have been to this location many times and the family wanted a little pick me up for our Pre Black Friday deals. I ordered ahead on the app as usual and there was a 15 minute wait for the order. No big deal as we were taking our time to get there. This was the only Starbucks open on thanksgiving at 8PM. When we got there I expected it to be busy which it was. The drive thru was packed but there was plenty of parking so we parked and headed in to grab our drinks. The wait said it would be about 15 minutes but we got there within 10 minutes and expected to wait. As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a friendly welcome and our order was already ready. Our drinks were all made correctly and we grabbed our caffeine and dipped. I appreciate Starbucks being open on a holiday to serve all of us that need that Starbucks fix. We tipped well to show our appreciation too. We might not be back to this location specifically but we will definitely be back at Starbucks soon!
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Feb 1, 2023~One of the employees was walking around with tissue in her nose `"whatttttt I have a runny nose`" is what she said! Yuck!!!! Ok And they take forever!!!!
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Apr 25, 2023~I regret coming to this Starbucks every time I do. They are remarkably slow and often turn off the order ahead option. I highlighted recommended a different store.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~May 26, 2023~Amazing just Amazing. This store was very kind to me and my children. They were very patient with my kids while they ordered their drinks. The line was a little long but staff was really good about making sure I knew my drinks were coming. Will be coming back!!!!!!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~May 26, 2023~This by far is my absolute favorite Starbucks to visit. Staff is friendly and remember me as soon as I walk in. Shout out to whoever made my drink the last time it was perfect!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Feb 18, 2021~Decided to get some Starbucks to start off my day. The drive thru line was long, literally wrapped out of the shopping center. I waited my turn, made it into line. I was able to order &amp; when I got to the window to pay the worker says `"We actually covered it for you today so you're good`" Like what!!? How nice!!! So of course i paid for the girl behind me :) love this Starbucks &amp; it's staff!!! What a great way to start the morning :)
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Mar 26, 2018~What do you ask from a Starbucks? speed, good service, clean restrooms... sitting area... This place did pretty well. Just the outside sitting are was too sunny when I arrived, I did not notice if they have umbrellas.Spent HOURS with a friend here and the staff was very professional and friendly. Patient too. I only remember Peter's name, but everyone was nice.They are in a shopping center, so they have plenty of parking. they are on the Southwest corner. If you are coming from the south, probably approaching by Greenway is better than Bell.Service was fast, and some of us were having refills. Remember to get your free same visit refills on brewed coffee, including cold brew, if you are a gold member. If you are not gold, I think the same visit refill is like 49 or 59 cents. The register shows the price, but once you scan your card, if it is gold the balance turns to zero.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Mar 19, 2022~Good service! Also coffee was good and bathrooms were nice it was a good place to get out of the sun
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Jan 4, 2018~Recently found this Starbucks and have since been to it twice. This location is across the street from the Arrowhead mall beside In-N-Out. I usually never come this far, so I didn't know about it until I went to Yelp to look for a Starbucks that wasn't in the mall. The location has plenty of parking, and if it gets busy and there doesn't seem to be any empty spots, the shopping center parking lot is right next to Starbucks, so I never have a problem finding a place to park. Inside is also large with many tables and chairs to relax while enjoying your coffee or other snack/drink item. The two times I've been here the place was neat and clean. I didn't notice any trash on the floors and empty tables were cleaned off. Ordering was super easy and the girl taking my order was very pleasant and efficient. I never order anything complicated, so my drink order is always out and ready for me by the time I put my card back into my wallet. Will be back again soon.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Nov 12, 2022~I just went to my second Starbucks, and when at the second Starbucks the barista says,  after waiting for a while that, `" oh, I forgot, we don't have any sugar free syrups`". I then say, `" oh no, I've just been to two starbuck today and one yesterday and they were out of sugar free syrups`". Barista stares at me and says ,`" ooookaaay`". I then get annoyed and say, `" that's not okaaaay`", meaning her response more than anything. The barista then says,`" what, it's not like you paid for the coffee yet, besides we are having a shortage`". I then say, `" then just say that`", I then drive off. The barista then hangs out the window and says loudly, `"you don't have to be that way`". Understand this folks, until she yells out the window, neither of us have raised our voices during our conversation. Outside of her condescending and indifferent  attitude, we were civil. I immediately stop and back up, she closes the window when she sees me stop. I wait for someone to come back to the window, and ask for a manager. The manager.... Let's say she did her job and listened( minus the attitude, yet ungraciously), and offered me a free coffee. Of course I decline, it wasn't about getting something free. It was about my respectfully telling her my experience and being talk to like I was a bother then as if I had been rude. if that young lady behaved that way with me, I know she has/will do it to others.Customer Service... the dying art. On my way to Dutch Bros or Dunkin' Donuts, haven't decided yet. ;)
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Aug 8, 2021~Came here on Saturday around 3 pm. They were out of almost everything. Couldn't get any Frappuccino's or ice coffees. All the syrups were out. The girl said the only thing they have Ingredients for is a kiwi refresher. I wound up getting it, never again. When my drink was handed to me I asked for a straw. They were out of that too.
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Jan 19, 2022~Normally a nice experience, but the girl taking my order this morning left me frustrated. She had an attitude towards me and seemed very impatient. They were out of both drinks that I normally get, which is fine. I was going to retry a drink I didn't like last time, but with a little more flavor so it wasn't so bland. She's the one that mentioned it to begin with. she ignored everything I said and didn't even let me order what I actually wanted. At least the guy at the window was nice.
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Mar 22, 2019~Not a bad Starbucks I always have great service my only compliant is my drink did not come the way I like it. I of course went through the drive as I was in a rush my first order was fine but my drink just had to much coffee. I know that sounds weird but I actually don't like coffee but I love frappes I just drown it in caramel to hide the coffee taste this one either had to much coffee or not enough caramel it just felt off. I still drank it as I didn't have time to go back just was not made the way I like it. Cashier was friendly and I did like her wish I caught her name as she was good.
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~May 28, 2020~Ordered my usual venti coffee frappe with toffee nut sweetener and I got to the window expecting just that only to be handed a grande. I told the young man working the window I ordered a venti and he looked at me confused and said ok. Turned around and told the others so they `"remade`" my drink. A couple mins later he handed me a venti and it looked like they literally just added more ice and cream to my drink and put it in a venti cup. I tasted it- EW. BLAND. I circled back around and told them again to please remake it. They did- it was great. BUT the customer service - or lack there of was terrible. No sorry, no nothing. Handed me the drink &amp; said `"here ya go.`" Then turned his back. WOW can you be more rude ? Will not be visiting this Starbucks location anymore.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Sep 6, 2019~Clear space, wide lobby, clean floors, good coffee, and customer service. I come here to study, and I always get lost in this cafe. Simple clean place to study or even just read a book. 10/10 highly recommend Update**9/6/19- still 10/10. New thing, was offered a glass of ice water and a straw. I appreciate the effort and time they took to have someone walk around and offer.   Great stuff

Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Feb 3, 2019~I went on the app to find an open Starbucks. I placed a mobile order since it said it was open for another hour. I walk up and all the doors are locked and the workers see me standing there for a good minute. Finally One man motions for me to go through the drive thru. We go to the window and instead of getting a greeting, Jonner (sp) says `"why didn't you stop at the speaker box?!`" I told him that I had placed a mobile order so I wasn't ordering again. He said `"you have to stop at the speaker box first!`" He closed the window and reiterated the same thing to us handed me my tea. I'm disappointed in the way I was treated and how he responded. Will not go back to this Starbucks!
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Aug 26, 2016~A nice start to the day This Starbucks is not my usual stop however, it's one of  my favorite. I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks iced white chocolate mocha, I can't think of anything, well maybe a vanilla scone.The service at this Starbucks might not be the fastest but it's still phenomenal and the staff are always very friendly. This location is clean, inviting, and feels comfortable and they have seating outside at the patio, plus a drive thru.My coffee was made exactly the way I order and tasted great. In addition, to the great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack. I really enjoy grabbing a cake pop or two to go.Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Aug 23, 2014~The location is much easier to get to and out of then the now closed 7410 West Bell Road store. Inside is much larger than previous location.  However it is not nearly as good of service now. Half a** the drink making. I guess in this area not a lot of competition.  I just guess I expect more, living in Washington.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Aug 9, 2020~I went to Starbucks this afternoon and I ordered a white mocha ice coffee .. the lady who took my order was very sweet and professional (I don't remember her name) but I just wanted to let the manager know that these ladies are so helpful and professional!   Excellent customer service!
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~Jun 6, 2021~I have been going to this Starbuck's (drive-thru) for years and typically go in the morning.  The employees are pleasant and the drinks are usually pretty good.  But, this time (06/05/21 around 7:30am) I received my Grande Frappuccino and not only was it overfilled, but the lid was not on properly.  Just bringing it in through the window and placing into the center console cup holder - it dripped all over my shirt and on to the console and left a puddle in the cup holder.  Good thing I was just going back home and not to work in my dress clothes.  I know you are busy and want to serve the customer as quickly as possible - but this is unacceptable.  Please slow down for a second and do it right!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Mar 30, 2018~I come here quite often and I do not know how I have not yet reviewed it. First and foremost the staff is awesome! They are so friendly and fast and always greet and thank me which I find pretty cool. A lot of times you can go to any location get in and out and no one acknowledges you (I order on the app) but that is not the case here. My drinks are always correct and you would think when you order on the app that they would get it correctly but sadly not always the case but I have not had an order messed up here which I truly appreciate because who wants to start the morning off that way. I used to have a go to Starbucks but since coming here this is now my go to location. Thank you ladies! (Morning staff are females)
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Jul 7, 2016~So we just moved to the Glendale area. And I have to have Starbucks every day like a religiously. I love this Starbucks and the location it's so close to target.This has to be one of the most fancies Starbucks we have ever been to. They have a huge selection of snacks and treats which one day we will try the most we ever get is bagel or a cake pop for our son and my fiancé usually just get a bacon cheddar sandwich. Along with our iced coffee.. Which they never mess up. Top of everything else the staff here are so friendly they always have a smile on their face you're greeted you feel welcome and it's just a great atmosphere all together!!!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Feb 28, 2021~Was walking my puppy MAZIE outside, and even though she was unloading and very busy , the woman brown hair  (who introduced herself as the manager ) stopped what she was doing to welcome me ,  and take the time to ask me howmy day was and offered a puppcup to my puppy.  My puppy is very shy but the managers energy was so positive and kind and she was instantly friends . (I hcome here at least 4x a week  to see this manager and to also let my puppy see her new friend ) !!! I love how pupoy friendly and respectful the staff are . They all make me feel like I'm at home
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Jun 22, 2021~Unlike any other Starbucks I have ever been to. The friendly atmosphere created by the staff is unmatched. Sasha  is one employee in particular that I absolutely adore and personally request my coffee be made by her. She undoubtably deserves a raise.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Dec 8, 2018~This is by far my favorite Starbucks location. The staff is incredible and so friendly! I use the drive thru very often on my way to work and I can always count on them to be super fast no matter how long the line is. Today I had a mobile order from a location closer to my home, when I got in my car I realized my regular drink was wrong even though it was in the right labeled cup. I stopped by this location to see if I could get it remade, and was greeted by Libby as soon as a walked in. I explained that I didn't think I had the right drink and she quickly remade my drink and was very courteous and professional. She was a lifesaver before a 13 hour shift!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Apr 5, 2018~This location always has very friendly staff and great coffee. Always coming back and recommending to everyone I see. Thanks Starbucks and keep the great coffee co
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Jan 4, 2018~This location always has very friendly staff and great coffee. Always coming back and recommending to everyone I see. Thanks Starbucks and keep the great coffee coming!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Aug 10, 2019~This is my favorite Starbucks location! When you pay $5+ per drink it should taste fresh, strong and be served by pleasant ppl. If you agree then you need to swing by this store or drive thru!! I tell everyone that my drink tastes consistently amazing and I never get attitude or snarky remarks from a barista at this store ... I can't say enough good things about this location!
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Feb 5, 2018~This place is so irritating. It's the closest location, tales mobile order, has a drive-thru and a nice large store with decent volume. However,  they are horribly inconsistent making me once again swear to myself I would never return. Today: order black iced tea via mobile order, arrive to white tea in which I was told the incorrect tea was made in the incorrect pitcher - knowing this, they still served it jp hoping I couldn't tell? In doing so, before my arrival to the store, an employee didn't consider brewing the correct tea, as I'm certain I'm not the only being hoping for black tea today. Hmmm Last week it was they just simply forgot to check/make any/all mobile orders, as I found myslef and anotjer party having to finally ask/tell the barista we had all placed orders - much to her confusion!!? Also last week, came in for usual iced black tea and got something that more resembled...??? Picture included - as I'm still unsure what exactly I received and if I'll suffer any consequences of drinking it. One would again think as a SBUX employee this would be  unacceptable and remake...nah, why bother? These are just a FEW examples.... On the other hand 75th and Thunderbird, Grand and 107th are where it's at. Save yourself thr frustration of this SBUX disappointment.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Dec 1, 2017~Very unhappy with this Starbucks, I ordered a violet drink with light ice and lime slices. I was charged $0.50 for ONE slice of lime and my drink had ice all the way to the top. $5.29 later, I'm feeling extremely gypped.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Jan 18, 2022~They always make my coffee perfect and when I come in the building they even know who I am and greet me by name
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Dec 8, 2017~Moldy toilets during the day and the bathroom hall is always blocked off at night!Their so lazy!
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Mar 4, 2019~Excellent location right off the 101. It's very roomy, comfortable &amp; has very fast service. The only downside is the awkward way you have to approach it by passing it &amp; navigating through parking for stores to access it. Other than that our fav spot when heading to the far west valley.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Sep 24, 2017~Great place to get a coffee and then settle down with your laptop and get some work done.  I've also had meetings here for interviews/business talk.  Nice, clean and convenient.  My `"go to`" Starbucks for sure when I'm on this side of town.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~May 14, 2017~I have tried and tried to give this Starbucks a fair chance. I would say that my boyfriend and I have been here over 50 times and It is always a huge struggle to get my drink made right. After today, I realized that I probably need to stop going there. I was not going to post a review, but after having my drink re-made three times and still having it taste disgusting, I decided I would.My drink is pretty simple, just iced coffee with coconut milk &amp; syrup. I like black coffee, coffee with just syrup, coffee with just milk, pretty much any way. I am not picky at all. However, my coffee always ends up tasting awful from here. I know Starbucks has coffee that falls on the more bitter side, but my coffee always tastes sour and gross. We have always gone here just because it's the closest one to us and the staff are friendly and don't ever get upset when we have to get our drinks remade. But, almost every single time we go we do end up having to ask them to remake it at least once or twice, and it's just not worth it for us tor return here, unfortunately.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Jul 25, 2022~urban air is very dirty and some of the workers that work cafe are very scrict and refuse to give me drinks for a 5 star review
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Jun 17, 2018~This store repeatedly causes me to question why I give Starbucks my money.  I can be the only person in line in the store, with seven (literally, seven) people behind the counter, and yet the average wait for coffee for me is 8 minutes.  When I use the app to pre-order coffee and it tells me hat the wait is, I time my arrival to arrive 1-2 minutes AFTER the waiting period given and I still have to wait 5 minutes for my coffee to be prepared.  The standard line for people inside the store seems to be `"sorry about the wait.`"These guys need to get their rhythm down re: interior (versus drive-thru) or else they need to go to a smaller `"drive thru only`" location.  It's gotten to the point that I can drive to a location that's 3 miles further away and still get faster coffee.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Jun 25, 2019~Really busy Starbucks but extremely inviting vibe, great summer music, and delicious drinks. Currently working on homework and this may be my new favorite Starbucks to do homework at. Barista was super sweet to walk around and ask if anyone needed water. Tried the guava iced tea with lemonade and it's delicious! Will be back sooner than later.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Aug 16, 2021~Went to Starbucks (drive thru) and the worker name Sara was horrible customer service, I was ordering for a family of 4 and after I said one thing she said `" is that all okay your total is .. `" i had to say several times I'm not done ordering she had no patience at all , once I got to the window horrible Attitude towards me, she as well snatched my card out my hand knowing I'm paying for her bills get paid . She was so horrible bad customer service!!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Dec 3, 2016~One of the best Starbucks I have been too. Its spacious, lots of places to sit, lots of charge ports for doing business work or school work. There is a large table you can reserve ahead which is great when having meetings or classes. Every employee I have met so far is helpful, positive and professional. All my different drinks I've had made over the last 6 months are always perfect too! My favorite location!
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Aug 22, 2019~Josiah is cute and I have a crush on him. They didn't have the teas I wanted, but he was genuinely super nice about it. Have a nice day handsome . - Sky-Island
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Mar 28, 2021~Okay, normally this would be a one star review (lol) this Starbucks is not known for its consistency in drinks. However, we had an issue multiple times and Jessica (Brunette Shift Lead) was SO quick to resolve our issue with kindness and a smile. I overheard her dealing with a couple other guest issues and she also dealt with those wonderfully. I'm very impressed. We actually try to avoid this location at all costs but will definitely be back because of Jessica! Awesome hire, Starbucks!
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Feb 24, 2021~Today I decide to go in instead of the drive thru. I ordered an iced venti green tea with classic instead of cane , grande iced chai tea latte, and a grande cinnamon dulce frap..... total was 16.00 and some change and they got 2 out of 3 drinks no where close to what I ordered. They fixed the first one and when I saw they did the second wrong I gave up! I just walked out with wrong drinks . One mistake ok, but 2/3?? Come on. A green tea is NOT HARD! I ended up with some matcha latte or something
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Sep 28, 2020~They are doing dine-in. It is PACKED in there with people. Not going to be supporting this location until they do drive thru only again. The drinks are made well and the employees are great but health comes first.
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Jul 27, 2016~I come here a lot considering I work right down the street. I normally get an iced Americano, and sometimes it's great and other times it's not. I used to be a huge fan of their iced coffee, but the last time I had it it tasted just like water. They always put too much cream (which I'm pretty sure they just dump some 2% in there) in the coffee even if you ask for a little so I've come to learn to just get mine black and add my own. Not a huge fan of the cold brew, but that's overall Starbucks. I'd rather get a cold brew somewhere else. When my drink is made correctly, I love it! It's a simple drink, and having once been a barista I am super picky with my coffee. Overall, good atmosphere and nice baristas. They helped me out when I first got their app and always have a smile on their face. The drive thru is also a huge plus when I'm too lazy to go inside.
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Jun 27, 2018~One of the better Starbucks locations in the area. This team is fast and efficient I've never had any issues with mistakes in orders. Their drive thru and in store ordering is quick paced. Indoor and outdoor seating is available at this location as well.
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Jan 10, 2021~Let me start off by saying these stars are ONLY for the morning shift consistent workers that are there. There amazing with communication, the pace of work, effort, customer service, cleanliness, team work, personable, etc. the main reason i come here is because i have made connections with your morning crew that is impeccable. I come here no exaggeration everyday, it's a bad habit. So needless to say, i know the difference in scheduling between your morning &amp; afternoon. Your afternoon crew is a JOKE. I am sure that is why they are on this shift because they are HORRIBLE with communication, example: i went in for a black iced tea sweetened... Easy right? Nope. This was my FIFTH attempt at an afternoon order because i love this Starbucks but after today lol, i will never go here in the afternoon it's like watching the circus trying out for auditions.. i also never ask for it be re made because I get all nervous and feel bad, today i asked and stated i would like more ice and water added to it. I WATCHED your male barista make the same drink he previously did with the same tea, it was comical he thought i wasn't watching but previously being a regional manager for a restaurant, you know what to look for. I politely explain to him again, he makes it for the third time and i finally took it BUT LITERALLY THE SAME THING. I laughed and took it because i didn't know how else to explain i wanted more ice? I have had previous experience with your younger girls, you need to have an attitude correction on just about all of them. I'm not sure who the manager is on duty but doesn't make themselves present. Your drive thru employees are sitting talking to each other, laughing in personal conversation i can hear while you have 12 cars in line and i hear her say hold on one sec please, TO FINISH HER STORY. It was comical the level of customer service your manager of duty holds for this crew, it needs SO much work.Again, your morning crew is the ONLY reason i come here. I absolutely adore each and every one of there bright faces each morning to greet each customer. Maybe have them train the afternoon employees? I don't know you need to start somewhere with them.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Mar 7, 2018~Great location to read read or work. It's easy to access from the road. The staff is always friendly and the service is great.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Sep 3, 2018~I want to show appreciation for one worker in particular named Michelle. We went to a Starbucks across the street for a mobile order pick up, but it was the wrong location and they wouldn't make us the drink there. So we went to this location to get our drinks and she was extremely helpful. She apologized even when it was our own faults for not noticing the address. She said that the other Starbucks should've made our drinks anyways since we were already there and had paid. Because of the misunderstanding, she actually gave us two gift cards because of the mixup. Thank you so much! I always love coming to this location. One time is was super busy and they forgot one of my drinks, so they upgraded the size and gave me a slice of coffee cake. They always take care of their customers and it's a great environment to study or have a conversation.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Sep 1, 2018~The store makes me wonder why continue to support Starbucks. I've been to the store more than five times and literally they have some the worst people who work there. The manager Ginger, i'm sorry but you need to treat your employees with respect and understand you should go out of your way to serve the customer I've seen you countless times three people lack of respect the lack of empathy. You are in the business of customer service your job so he relies on the customer experience if you continue creating a crap experience for the customer the customer will no longer go to your place of business.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Feb 10, 2018~Thank you for allowing us to order at 10 minutes to close!!! Best tasting chai tea latte ever!!! Van 1 thanks you!!!!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Dec 16, 2018~The staff is the best part! The manager, Edith, is the biggest sweetheart and will make anyone feel welcome! No matter what time of day you visit I can guarantee you that you'll be greeted with a swarm of smiles! Ginger, Jeserae, Michelle, Jillian, and Teresa have made sure I've had a good experience every time I've visited(a lot)! Plus, they have happy hour almost every week on Wednesdays and Thursdays, my friends and I go every happy hour!! Love my 83rd and Bell starbucks!(:P.S. Get the peppermint white mochas while they last!! So good!!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Nov 8, 2017~Definitely one of the better locations. The drive thru line always moves quickly. Mobile orders are always correct and ready to go when I get to the store. Great customer service!
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Dec 17, 2017~Poor customer service. I'm very patient. 10am Sunday December 17th. I ordered a coffee and a sausage egg and cheddar. Received my coffee ok, but waited 15 minutes for no muffin. Many had went through the line by then and received food. I mentioned it to the person at the bar. She yelled it down the way and assured me it would be a minute. I waited another 10 minutes, nothing. I went to the front counter told the story to the person at the register. Same thing, 10 minutes nothing. Returned to her again, she said `"oh are you still waiting on your muffin? I said, no I'm done, can I get a refund or something? She gave me a refund for my muffin only and said nothing, not even a sorry. Not friendly, not cool.
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~Jun 15, 2020~I typically love this location but they got my drink horribly wrong today and I was in the drive thru so I left thinking my drink was correct. It wasn't! And I could not turn around as I was going to work. When I called them to let them know and try and get a refund, the line is busy!! So so horrible!! I highly advise you to fix this ASAP! My drink tasted HORRIBLE! The fact that your phone line doesn't work during a time like this when it's difficult for some to walk into your location, is terrible planning and terrible customer service!!
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Jul 26, 2015~Great place for catching up or for a quick informal meeting. Used to be a Jack in the Box, so the drive thru and interior are well laid out, much better than a typically-crowded Starbucks. I will say, though, this is the only one I've been to that has on multiple occasions added cream and/or sweetener to my iced americano without asking. Kinda weird, but maybe it's just random chance. Some of us CAN handle black coffee
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Jul 19, 2018~I'm sure the coffee tastes just fine but we didn't end up staying as there was no place to sit at 1:30 in the afternoon.  Although large looking on the outside and no line to order they have fairly limited seating and the stools at the community table are too uncomfortable to want to squeeze in there.   Almost every table they had were occupied by individual students or 'work from homers' who looked pretty settled in their work and didn't appear to be leaving anytime soon.  This is just not a location that is good for business meetings with clients.  (We ended up just walking to the Denny's next door which actually ended up being a great set up for a meeting.)
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Nov 4, 2020~I visit Starbucks often and never had a problem with this until now. Also, I've been a barista for a company that served Starbucks coffee so I know how the drinks are made, for the most part. I ordered a venti Chai Creme Frappuccino with a shot of espresso added. This drink requires 2 pumps of chai syrup but I asked to substitute one pump for a pump of pumpkin syrup, which had never been an issue until recently. We were allowed to sub syrups where I worked as well, we only charged extra when someone added syrup. The guy said he couldn't do it because anytime someone adds syrup, there's a charge. I told him it was a substitution and not an addition, he didn't care. He said he couldn't ring it in without it charging me and I told him that normally, the cashier puts `"ASK ME`" on the order and just tells the barista what to do. He still didn't care and refused to do it so I just skipped the pump of pumpkin. He tried to nickel and dime me over a pump substitution. It was especially irritating considering how much I spend at Starbucks on a regular basis. Very disappointed
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Jan 8, 2018~Lately the customer service has been lacking. Takes forever to get acknowledged. My order, as well as the two people after mine, had issues. Hopefully this place doesn't continue to do poorly.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Oct 25, 2016~Horrible, cold brew horrible ice coffee, horrible horrible horrible. I've given this Starbucks location chance after chance and they have been more misses then hits. I can't anymore. I suggest going into target to get your Starbucks don't let the drive thru misguide you. It's not worth it! I want to just say honestly that the baristas don't know what they are doing, can't speak for all there but a good portion. Nothing is consistent, burnt coffee and all.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Apr 28, 2017~The BEST Starbucks in the Glendale/Peoria area!!  The staff is friendly and accommodating.
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Sep 22, 2017~I really like this particular Starbucks. The service is always friendly. I especially like being greeted on the way in the door. No other place than this Starbucks. Remember when they used to call it Char-bucks because of burnt tasting coffee? Not at this place. I'll admit, I'm a black coffee type but never a hint more harsh than espresso here. The seating and access around the place is very spacious and accommodating for those setting up a mini office With a tall hot coffee with room for sugar.
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Jul 13, 2016~This is one of my favorite locations. The drinks are always made perfectly and the staff is incredible. My only complaint is the parking lot. It is so tiny and the line is so long. If you park and go in you will likely be closed in by the line that wraps around the building. However, it doesn't stop me from going everyday!
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Jul 28, 2019~I have to say I was  a loyal Starbucks customer up until this point. I walk into the Starbucks and I asked for a grande nitro cold brew in a Venti cup with ice and the barista states she cannot do it and I asked why not every other Starbucks does this for me it's pouring a grande drink and a (larger cup giving me room for my ice)  and she says because there's too much nitro how is there too much nitro to pour in a Vente cup?? Yet not too much nitro for the smaller cup? I'm a little bit puzzled by this so I said OK well, awesome  you have just lost yourself a customer... and FYI it is a completely competitive market out there if you're not familiar with economics there is a Dutch Bros not too far from here and if I'm not mistaken a coffee and tea leaf just across the street. You're not the only coffee spot around here. She said `"whatever`" ... cool Starbucks... first you kick police out of your store then drive away super loyal customers. Your should probably screen your employees a bit better.
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Oct 26, 2016~Waited 15 minutes for food - employees standing around and talking. They waited ten minutes to put my food in the oven when nothing else was inside. They said `"I just saw your food`". Terrible!
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Dec 4, 2018~So I'm not giving Starbucks a bad review it's the service, I saw the new girl at the cashier her name looks like `"Carrie`" or something like that.. she had zero patience with an old guy before me. Then when I came up I asked for a particular latte that's not on the menu but is known she copped an attitude with me.. for someone new she should be patient and quit while she's ahead .. I think what I disliked most is how she treated the old guy.. very tacky and distasteful.. certainly not the starbucks way of things.. be nice new girl.. one day you'll be old too
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Apr 8, 2016~Biggest Starbucks we've ever been to.   It was remodeled a few years ago and it's helped them manage the traffic better.  Lots of seating available inside and outside. Drive thru moves pretty quickly.   Great customer service.   All orders to date have been on point.  Very clean.
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Jan 11, 2016~This place just reminded me of why I stopped going to Starbucks. Zero conversation. After I pay for my cup the employee hands me a bag and just stands there watching me put my purchase in the bag; awkward.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Sep 17, 2018~As many people have, I have been too many, many different Starbucks locations and this specific location is the friendliest I have ever been to. I don't normally leave reviews for such major chain companies, but I feel I needed to leave one for this location because it was such a pleasant visit. The girl at the register was SO nice it was almost unusual (in the best way lol) and the barista who served my drink was just as nice! I just felt great leaving this location and since I live here now, I will be visiting this location more often.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~May 19, 2017~Fun and quiet. Inside Barnes and Noble. Bring laptop, earbuds, and enjoy. Tables around bar. Private and good snacks served with a smile.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Jan 8, 2019~Wonderful customer service! The employees are personable and friendly. The food/drink is always wonderful. Keep it up!!
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~Mar 28, 2016~Writing this review for students looking for a place to study . When this first opened it was heaven for my friends and I. The biggest Starbucks I've stepped foot in . An outlet no matter where you sit AND they close at 11 on the weekends. However as more people found out about the place it is not a friendly environment to study anymore unless you come with headphones. It is always crazy crowded in there at any time of the day or week. I'm lucky if I come and there's an open table for me to study on. The WiFi is crazy slow too, I don't come here if I need the Internet it's that bad. A lot of people still come here to study but this place is my last resort now. As for the drinks I've had better Starbucks and the baristas are usually rude here no crazy good service.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Feb 24, 2016~Well, I live in WA State most of the time so I am very familiar with good coffee and good coffee places. This Starbucks rates with the best of them. We drive a little out of our way to come here because we enjoy the ambiance, the coffee, the comfy seating, excellent WiFi, great employees, etc. Arizona needs a lot more spots like this so hope all of the good competition is paying attention!
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Jul 14, 2018~Wow this person should be fired or something but I went to order and the lady that was taking my order then asked what was my name which I then told her my name and she was just pretty much making fun of my name not in a VERY nice way and she just keep how my name sounded like a disease and the how this sounded like a guys name I was so pist-off! but obviously I had good manners not to say anything and plus me and my friend's drink wasn't even made right had too much everything and my green tea had too much green tea powder super messy.
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Nov 23, 2015~Big Starbucks, friendly and order is always right. Drive thru is fast. They always have what I want to order as far as food unlike a lot of the other locations. Bonus....customer in front of me just paid for my drink!
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Jan 1, 2015~I ordered a caramel Macchio with extra caramel, it had barely any caramel so I asked them to add some, they proceeded to take the lid off my drink, take the lid off the caramel bottle and pour it in my drink.  When you pay 5.00 for a drink it better be made right, and this was just plain rude.  Plus the the drive thru is always so slow.  Won't be back to this location.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Dec 4, 2014~I like this Starbucks. The drive thru is always lightning fast. The staff is efficient and friendly. And the location itself is pretty big for a Starbucks. I'm glad they opened a location close to work for me.
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Aug 21, 2014~Inside is huge &amp; they have plenty of tables even when it's busy. Baristas have always been very friendly which is much different from the Union Hills location. Plenty of parking too!
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Feb 17, 2015~The location is great. I have been here several times. The service here is fair.  They are nice when you order, but you are paying premium prices for a custom drink.  About 1/2 the time they don't write my specifications down. If I order 2`" of heavy cream, they put a B for Breve. I want heavy cream not 1/2 and 1/2. Today I ordered iced, and when all the ice melted I went back in for more ice.  I was completely ignored for 10 minutes.  Keeping her head down. I went back in the pay line to ask for ice. That was another wait,  though I was the only one in line. It was obvious as I held up my already purchased drink, that I didn't need much.  Oh well. I'm over it.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Feb 23, 2016~Huge shout-out to Alex (name tag says Princess Alex) for brightening my day today! Incredible customer service (as usual at this location!)
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~Mar 16, 2015~I really love how big this Starbucks is and the outside seating area. Right when I walked in I literally said to my sister, `"Woah this place is hella big!`" I love how nice it was inside. The lighting was dim, which I liked a lot. There was a long table with a lot seats and multiple seating areas inside. Anyways, what I didn't like was the lady at the cashier. I felt rushed. She kept staring at my sister and I waiting. Like homegirl... We're the only two in line. Be patient. She wasn't rude though so I guess that was alright. All in all, I'll be back. This Starbucks is huge and I love that.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Aug 19, 2015~I go to Starbucks every morning before work &amp; I have to see I wasn't too pleased with this location. I normally go to the one off Union Hills but this was the closest while that one was being renovated. The people in the drive through made me feel rushed &amp; an inconvenience. I also ordered a trenta one day &amp; was given a venti. I asked if I was a trenta because it looked a little smaller &amp; the girl at the drive thru rudely said no &amp; just looked at me like I was stupid. I definitely won't be going back to this one again.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Jan 28, 2015~I was so happy when this Starbucks location opened...it is so nice to have a drive thru. The service is quick and my coffee is always perfect
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Nov 8, 2017~I am so impressed with this Starbucks. Everyone was so kind and their service was super fast despite being really busy. My order came out perfectly. I drink a lot of coffee and Starbucks is my favorite but the service has never blown me away before. I really wish I lived close by, I would definitely make this my go-to coffee shop! Thank you to the lovely ladies there for brightening a grim day for me!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Sep 6, 2015~In coming here enough, some of the employees recognize me and will get my drink started before I order or get it done right after I order. It's great to see they remember someone and will do their best when they can to be as fast as they can. Aside from the parking lot being tough when the drive thru is busy, this is quickly becoming my favorite starbucks and one of my favorite stops in the mornings before work. Thanks and keep up the great work!
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Jul 28, 2015~Friendly staff, quick at the drive thru or dine in, no issues with the drink I order. Plenty of comfortable seating on the inside, the area is nice and open. Place is clean and always in good shape when I come in.
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~Aug 12, 2017~Normally pretty good drinks but today I got a cappuccino &amp; more than half of it was just foam.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Nov 30, 2017~I literally just downloaded this app just so that I can type something about this place. I just went there to get a venti iced caramel macchiato I asked for it stirred with an extra shot no ice but that I still wanted it filled to the normal standard level that I did not want extra milk when I get to the window the cup is practically filled to the top I very politely told her that I had asked for it without any extra milk in it I still wanted it filled to the normal standard line not to compensate for the missing ice when she gave it back to the person who made my drink she simply dumped out some of it and gave it back it's not the fact that I needed the room it's the fact that I did not want more milk put in it!! you changed the flavor of the drink and dumping some out does not help anything even if you were in a hurry or busy you should still be taking care of Beverage quality!!!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Oct 17, 2016~The usual great coffee here. All the workers are friendly as well. It is a bigger Starbucks too, so ihas more seating space to get some work done.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Feb 28, 2017~Today I was running late and ordered something new. It actually turned out to be wrong but as usual the ladies here saved the day! They made me a whole new drink correctly. They have great attitudes and always willing to help.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Jun 9, 2015~Absolutely outraged by this coffee shop. I will not return after giving this location multiple tries. They are by far the most inconsiderate employees I have seen and if you go to the counter to order, expect that none of the baristas will greet you or come to take your order. They won't get any of my business.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Dec 12, 2016~Everytime I visit this location I regret doing so. I recieve horrid customer service from the same guy, although the rest of the baristas are quite friendly. My drinks are almost always of poor quality, and the guy i previously referred to never asks me for my name.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Nov 28, 2014~Ordered 5 drinks,  paid for 5 and only got 4...and they are not even answering their phone..very bad customers service will never go back to this Starbucks again
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Dec 21, 2015~Great Starbucks even though everyone spends more time talking than working. Some people actually work while others play on phones. Great drinks always made right even though the wait can be long.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Sep 7, 2014~Really love this location.  Plenty of parking and easy access.  This location has friendly baristas and a drive thru.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Feb 9, 2015~Glad this location opened up - we needed a drive thru nearby.  This place is ALWAYS busy.  The staff are very personable.  The inside is new.   They have a few `"comfy chairs`", but wish they had a few more.  Wifi is pretty good.  I'll be back!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~May 30, 2015~Excellent service! Really kind, respectful, and helpful baristas. Drink was perfect on multiple occasions! Choose this location if you're in the area.
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Aug 28, 2016~without receipt how can one particpate in the special promo , never receive receipt unless I ask for one, always pay in cash, to bad starbucks invests this money on promo only to have employees prevent customer participation.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~2~Apr 28, 2021~I am not a big Starbucks fan to start, and this is a poor Starbucks. You should know that I am a coffee nerd, and roast my own coffee beans at home. Therefore I have high standards, but am forced to find coffee where I can when not at home. Starbucks roasts their beans very dark, so the roast flavor overpowers the bean's natural flavor, thereby providing consistency at a cost of flavor. This is my primary complaint at the corporate level. Additionally, if Starbucks is going to call their workers `"baristas`" then the need to properly train them as a barista. I don't blame the employees for their lack of knowledge. For example, I ordered a black Verdana (light blonde roast) this morning. The sign said it was available as a pour over brew. This is a superior brew method, and how I brew at home. The `"barista`" said they already had  veranda coffee brewed via drip machine. I told her I understood, but told her that I preferred the pour over method. She responded that `"pour over`" simply means they can make one cup at a time and only do this when there isn't any available from the drip machine. She didn't not understand the difference in coffee brewed via the two different methods. It's like the difference between cooking hamburgers via outside grill vs pan in the stove. She was not a barista. I needed my morning coffee so I took a cup from drip machine.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~2~Jun 13, 2018~Not very happy this morning about my Strawberry Refresher. It literally taste like water with a few strawberries  added to it.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Nov 2, 2019~5 stars for MICHELLE and the other woman working today (sorry did not get her name). Michelle was so friendly and had a smile on her face the entire time, greeting customers and working through the long line this morning. This is inside the JW Marriott lobby and I appreciated that prices were not inflated. Great and small and cozy but so friendly and fast hence the 5 stars!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~1~Nov 29, 2022~Great ambiance and location to have a coffee. There are warm hearths outside and you can't beat the nature and the beauty. Except for the Coffee that tastes terrible. They do not know how to make beverages that one can remember. The Macchiato was sweet and not mingled well with the best coffee roast and milk. Just quite disappointing. Even making coffee at home is better than this.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~May 20, 2018~Decent selection of merchandise. Had all the new items Starbucks is now offering. Many snacks. Service was friendly and prompt. Seating is very limited.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~May 30, 2019~This Starbucks is amazing! There is barely a wait if you come in at the right time, and the blended strawberry lemonade is AMAZING!! This is probably my highest recommendation for a starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~1~Jul 27, 2018~I make a purchase from Starbucks every day. This  was the worst customer service I have ever experienced at a Starbucks. First of all the employee was very unfriendly when I walked in.. I was in line behind a group of kids. A good looking man came in after me and the employee started flirting with him.. another woman came in after him. She took my order as if I was in her way.. didn't ring it up correctly.. and proceeded to make the drinks behind me first.. when she finally got to my drink she did not even know what I ordered.. I am here at the hotel for the rest of the week but I will not be using Starbucks services.. this experience was on 7/26/18 at 4:00pm.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Jun 21, 2018~They got an order of 13 people perfectly right with 13 drinks and 7 food items and they were very kind although very small but it's just in a hotel
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Mar 16, 2024~Workers are sweet. Fast service. It's Starbucks.The problem is the whoever designed that parking lot/drive-through.  Absolutely stupid.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 1, 2024~This is my favorite Starbucks. The employees are beyond nice, efficient, and friendly. I appreciate that their drinks are consistently good. There's one closer to my house, but it's worth it to drive a little farther to experience this location, and know my drink will be perfect!  And I love the crew there, always going above and beyond.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 4, 2022~This Starbucks has the nicest baristas, and their drinks are always spot on! This is my favorite Starbucks location
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jan 23, 2024~Need atmosphere in this Starbucks location was very peaceful and simplistic. Not crowded or anything. The workers were friendly and helpful though. I felt a few were kind of judgy and the customerspurs that became like friends just in the time. I was having coffee together because of this.  Nice starbucks location we'll go to it again also i'm very clean bathrooms
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Aug 20, 2024~Worst customer service ever from the employees at this location! Glad to see others have mentioned similar problems with an employee named `"Doodie`". She clearly needs some additional customer service training or to find another profession! She should never be placed face to face with customers!!! Isn't management aware how awful she is?!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Nov 30, 2021~After being a regular here I am bumping up to five stars. The ambience and atmosphere is very pleasant with the bonus of a nice, enclosed outdoor patio. Manager Ryan does an excellent job with an outstanding staff.Top ten SB in Phoenix.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~May 12, 2021~SB at the intersection of Bethany Home and 16th with a busy drive thru, large seating area and nice enclosed patio. I was allowed to sit inside in the nice cushiony chairs, charge my phones and use the toilet.Staff does a nice job but I found it somewhat innappropriate they were having a staff meeting in the customer seating area where I could hear them complaining about certain customers.The manager should hold these meeting in a private area or before, after customer hours.There is alot of traffic so be careful walking and driving onto the property.Recommended above avg. SB.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Aug 30, 2024~Check your bank after buying! They admitted to double charging being an REGULAR issue they `"can't help with`" so I was double charged and they told me to call corporate who they told me to dispute my charge. So I guess `"Oops we steal from people sometimes,`" you deal with it. They also have constant `"electrical issues`" that either shut down the store or the drive through, the screen not working (the image is just permanently sideways) &amp; they are absolutely rude.I went in and spent $20 for coffee and food and had to walk in because the drive thru didn't have debit card function again (not a big deal, but def killed time I didn't have). So I  placed my order and stood by the pick up counter.Without provocation someone who seemed like a manger asked me if I had purchased something recently. I was confused because I was just standing there with an obvious intent of waiting for mg order so looked at the person who JUST rang me up and said calmly and confused `"you did that it right?`" To which she diverted her eyes, didn't answer me or her.Then the (maybe?) manager said `"oh well ok.`" And she walked away.I say `"I'm sorry, I'm confused, does it not show my order is in your system?`" I was confused and worried so I asked `"so is mine coming up? I'm confused.`" She said `"oh we have 5 online orders in front of you.`" And walked away again.I panicked because she made it seem like I was in for a wait and I had to get to work so I asked nicely if they could please do mine really quick out of mercy so I wouldn't be late for work and she gave me attitude and walked away again. If she couldn't that's fine but maybe tell someone `"it won't be but a few minutes but they really are bound to keeping the line of drinks.`" But, no, just vague answers and attitude for me asking such a crazy question.I'd like to stress the place was empty and there were 3 cars in the drive through (lucky folks who had cash). There was a counter full of drinks and food that wasn't picked up yet (which were both melting and getting cold, so I know I'll never order online either). I'm just saying wouldn't have been a huge burden to just be nice.I decided my time was more important so I asked for a refund. They didn't ask why, offer to help me or even really say much. THEY ALSO DIDN'T TELL ME THEY COULDN'T REFUND MY TIP, which may have swayed my refund decision had they been people who cared at all about customer service. They just did the refund and I left.I then check my bank account &amp; I was double charged and no pending refund. So, that's now $40 taken out of my account.I called and after them looking up their charges they found mine. We determined it would probably be good to stop by and get receipts of the transactions and they `"refunded`" me just in case. When I got there they refunded that and informed me my tip was theirs. They also refunded me less than my order by accident so had to do another transaction.That's when they said that `"recently there have been problems with DOUBLE CHARGING A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY`" and told me to call corporate. So they openly admitted that `"oops, we just steal money sometimes.`"SO, I paid $40 plus tip to go in, waste time &amp; be treated like a jerk for nicely asking for some help &amp; leave with nothing... and yes it was nice, not some entitled Karen taking out her unhappiness on strangers. Although I think that employee could use a few less gems in her tiara. This place is a complete joke. You'd think a multi-billion dollar company could afford to permanently repair their buildings, and swindle customers out of tips for ZERO service. As far as customer service, they need more training on how to speak words to human beings.Update: because I don't have a Starbucks account I was never refunded by corporate the additional $20 and the location has done nothing.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 7, 2024~Charge me $.70 to change milk to coffee in a Frappuccino. Then told me to go to another Starbucks when I said `"other Starbucks don't charge me for like that but it's fine`"Rude customer service. This was from the manager after she took the headset from the employee. I wasn't even mad just a little disappointed. I had to tell them it was fine multiple time and that I was okay with paying for the extra charge multiple times. Seemed like someone was having a bad day.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Feb 11, 2023~Not only did I wait 25 minutes, the customer service was horrible. I know it was just one barista at the window that honestly had no idea what was going on or seem to care. He tried to send us away without giving us our entire order. Then, I look at my drink, which is almost $6, and it's not even shaken. I slightly modified it and it wasn't correct also. It's totally okay that I had berries, but for my drink to not even be shaken? LAZY.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jan 26, 2024~I have no idea if they were shortstaffed I asked them I was in line for 15 minutes to get one coffee there was only three cars ahead of me slowest service I've ever seen at Starbucks and then by the time I got the tall vanilla latte it wasn't even that good we will not be returning back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Sep 1, 2023~Consistently this Starbucks location leaves a lot to be desired - but today I couldn't even choke down my drink. I asked for extra cinnamon and it appears the shaker lid MUST have fallen off, I can't imagine anyone purposefully doing this to a customer's drink. I scooped off as much as I could and tried to take a sip of the drink but it was ruined. This was the final straw and I will not return to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jul 19, 2024~Drive thru was closed. Ordered a Caramel Ribbon Crunch Frappuccino and got something mocha. Go somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Sep 18, 2022~Overall 3.5. Quality of product TODAY only 4.5. Staff customer service today, 4.5. Atmosphere 3, cleanliness 2.75. Ease of getting into store 1.5.  Drive through 360° around store can't even walk in and no parking.  Crazy customers trying to get out of parking lot onto 16th St. North, 1 star.   My 11-year-old son approve this review. If cost is an issue as many have complained please check out his photo of his Starbucks hack. A Venti Frappuccino split and blueberry scone to share with a friend for only  $10. Only $5 each!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jan 26, 2022~We all know about the circle jerk situation at this location. Everyone gets in line and all cars are trapped in circle around the building and it's gridlock. Don't attempt getting in line before work, you will be late.I'm giving them one more star because they now have someone outside attempting to direct traffic. So they've finally acknowledged the issue and are at least trying. Starbucks, please go watch an In n Out or a Chick-Fil-A drive thru. They've mastered the routing of vehicles.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Oct 5, 2019~Do you like circle jerk coffee? This place is a nightmare of epic proportions. If you have 30 minutes to spare, and don't easily get angered, this is the place for you. Welcome to 1880 architectural design by Helen Keller. Starbucks coffee is a Starbucks coffee. Nothing special, nothing original, very standard, like Flowers Foods white Wonderbread. If you need your caffeine fix, I get it but not the most convenient way to get caffeine. We avoid at all costs. 16th St and Bethany location. Do yourself a favor, drive 1/8 of a mile north up 16th street to Human Bean Coffee and have some original coffee without being trapped on the LA Freeway of stagnancy.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Dec 12, 2023~Can't make a simple drink right. When I asked if chestnut is a sauce or syrup the brunette clearly called white mocha in my drink (their mistake) to be chestnut syrup. Another time I ask why their lids always come off (multiple occasions). The same bore-ista says `"the lids just don't fit on those cups.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Apr 6, 2024~I went this morning and after asking a question to clarify, the girl who was at the drive thru (her name was Dodie) was very condescending and rude.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 30, 2020~Busy drive through location. A very popular Starbucks that draws lots of traffic. They have a great control of traffic and offer a wide variety of menu offerings. This location lacks the level of professionalism and treatment not only to their customers but there employees. My recent experience with the was not that my drink was wrong it was the way I was treated by an employee named Laura or Lauren today. She does not emphasize leadership skills and has a bad attitude.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Mar 8, 2017~Of course I am a fan of Starbucks! This is my neighboorhood location that I visit often.  Since I love Starbucks I deal with the wait time. This location stays busy but it seems like the staff order of operation is not up to par with the other valley locations. That is the only downfall about this location. Other than that they ROCK! My food is always hot. My drinks are made right. The venue is clean and well stocked with inventory.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 9, 2024~Mike, this is my local Starbucks. Not only did you hand me the incorrect order you asked me to go back around in line after I've waited behind many cars in a traffic jam. This was extremely unacceptable when you could have easily just make the correction. I been coming here for years and I realizing the service at this location had gone down significantly and I'm starting to think it's because of the service you provided me today. I have work in customer service for many years and my office just a few min down the street. I'm sure upper management would not take this kindly.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Dec 1, 2022~Terribly slow and service unfriendly. Coffee is not worth the wait and the customer service needs to improve
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jan 18, 2024~This Starbucks is absolutely atrocious the parking is like a circle of doom. The parking lot is awful. They need to move this location or come up with a better system for the drive thru and parking. If you get caught in the circle of doom where you can't get in the drive thru or out. The baristas are usually great and friendly (they probably know the parking sucks and know they can't do anything). I would hope this Starbucks location figures out a better drive thru situation.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Aug 18, 2022~Tried to convince me that the white globules floating throughout my shaken espresso did not, in fact, mean they had a problem with their milk, but that this is how all shaken espressos are! So all the espressos I have had up to this point - the ones that didn't have curdled milk specks in them - these were the ones that were flawed? Right, sure.How about this instead: how about you quickly say `"that's odd can I make you another one with a different type of milk real quick?`" So easy! And then I might have nice things to say instead of this. But here we are. Avoid this place, employees appear to have been trained to minimize any possible loss, no matter how minor, even if it means gaslighting the customer.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Nov 8, 2023~This place such as horrible place i have ever been. the people who work there are always rude. by the way if you don't let people come inside for mobile pick up then don't let us do the mobile order through the app.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Sep 27, 2022~Awful service. I have used Starbucks app for a long time and have their gold card. Was gifted a coffee from a friend yesterday on my birthday, so I didn't get a chance redeem the free one from Starbucks on the actual day. I politely asked the drive thru attendant if they would grant me some leeway and let me redeem the free coffee a day after (which I didn't think would be a big deal), and she refused. Not trying to sound entitled, but I give a lot of money to this company, and I feel unappreciated in this situation. Won't be coming back to this location.It's also worth mentioning I was planning to also buy a coffee for my girlfriend, and not that the attendant cares about sales (though they're weirdly stingy and stringent on birthday redemption policy), they did lose a sale on this visit.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Aug 14, 2018~You know, this Starbucks is hit or miss. Mornings and afternoons are quick. Evenings are pretty slow through the drive thru. Parking isn't great and the exit from the drive thru can get really backed up.Otherwise, there are a few team members (?) that know me and my husband by name and are super sweet.One thing I like about Starbucks is that it's predictable when it comes to drinks, so that's good. I know what a caramel macchiato should taste like and it's standard for most/all Starbucks. A couple of times I've ordered a grande, the team member has said it back to me, but then I'm charged for a venti.I tend to stop by the Starbucks closer to work, but sometimes we like to stop by this location because it's on our way to where we're going.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Dec 28, 2021~This Starbucks needs to get there stuff together.   They randomly closed at 4 on random days with no rhyme or reason and they do not block the drive they or put info on the screen. After waiting at the order screen for five minutes I pulled forward to the window and a girl tried talking to me through the window instead of opening it. Looked like there were four or five employees inside apparently they were closed. Again all someone had to do would be walk 7 feet to put something up to block the drive-through pull in.This is the third time this is happened in about two months.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Oct 22, 2022~Slower than molasses. If you don't have enough workers, then you should charge less for drinks. Waited in drive through for half hour. But couldn't get out because I was fenced in
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Dec 30, 2019~Talk about customer RIP off. Purchased a french press 4 days ago that I had to return today due to being gifted the same one for christmas. They didn't give me a receipt when I purchased it for some reason. They would not take it back 4 days later even though:1. They are the only ones that sell this french press as it has their name on it.2. Still has the tags, never used 3. Credit card record shows the serial number for the exact purchase of that exact product. What a RIP off.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 18, 2019~I ordered an iced green tea latte and ordered light ice. There was more ice than drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jan 26, 2018~It's a regular Starbucks. The parking lot is a freaking nightmare, but it's super convenient in the mornings for me.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Apr 9, 2023~they just made me the best drink over had in my entire life. iced oatmilk brown sugar shaken espresso with mocha cold foam. FIRE
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jul 28, 2022~Probably the worst Starbucks in the area. If you can avoid do so. Who ever designed the drive thru had no idea what they were doing. As I sat in line for 20 mins I thought of all the solutions in my mind. Plus the people who work there are very slow or just so overwhelmed.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jul 18, 2022~Asked for `"extra oatmilk 3/4`" and they put `"oatmilk 1/2`" and when I asked if it was gonna be filled at the window bc I saw what he put he said yes, and then he swirled around my drink that has no oatmilk in it. Had to go to cvs to get whole milk that I don't want so I have an actual drink to drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~May 16, 2022~Just a warning if you're looking to go here after 3:30pm. Wish after 3pm it wasn't a kid playground. Dozens of kids from the school ordering dozens of (just) waters and crowding the already small building, counters, exits and entrances. Don't forget the parents blocking traffic waiting to pick up their child at the Starbucks that has absolutely no room. Just feel bad for the employees.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Mar 4, 2022~I decided to go into the store this morning because the drive thru was ridiculously long. Quick and efficient service!! Plus the barista who took my order, Priscilla, was very sweet. Thanks, Priscilla!! You made my day
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Aug 4, 2020~Staff are pretty nice and they're usually very fast but sometimes can be slow depending on the day. One time it took soooo long for me to get my coffee in the drive-thru but they apologized and that was good enough for me. Their espresso machine was down so that was understandable. Great staff. I do not like the parking area though. It's very tight and small. And if it gets busy, it can be crowded cause there's only way to get in and out so if you're stuck, everyone is gonna be stuck if that makes sense haha. Very small car park space. Only a few can park since the other side of the parking area isn't for Starbucks customers. Not bad but the drive-thru can be super tricky with parked cars. That's all. Service is amazing, coffee is great but they definitely need to change the parking situation.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Dec 4, 2016~As other reviewers mentioned the drive thru/parking lot situation is a nightmare I ordered a chocolate chip cookie  warmed up...the cookie was delicious, but it wasn't warm AT ALL and on the screen it clearly said `"warmed`". I didn't make a fuss about it, I was headed home and warmed it up there.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~May 12, 2018~This Starbucks is on par for what you expect from Starbucks. I've always encountered friendly employees, good service and the drinks I know and love. However, I have to comment that this location is a logistical nightmare. It's a busy corner with various other businesses and coffee shops/restaurants in close proximity. As a result the parking spaces are at awkward angles and cramped. The drive thru has to loop around the building and it's easy to get stuck leaving the drive thru or trying to go into it. Those parked also get stuck trying to get away from cars waiting to enter the drive thru. If you're in the area and desperate for Starbucks it's a fine location, just prepare to deal with cars and a wait!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 21, 2017~Everyone friendly and happy at 5:30am in the morning. The cashier was interesting to talk to and the barrista had my coffee ready by the time I finished paying.This is listed on Yelp as opening at 3:30am but it opens at 4:30am.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Dec 23, 2022~The lady this morning was so nice and she was quick and made great convo! Give her a raise !!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 17, 2022~The app is a complete piece of monkey s#it. Don't bother saving your User name and pw. It'll sign you out every time regardless &amp; won't let you sign back in until you close the app, reopen and enter the info 2 separate times. Super convenient when you want to order ahead. Fk off starbux.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 24, 2017~From the outside, this location looks tiny. Because of this, I used to avoid ever going inside and opted for the drive-thru instead... until I became desperate to find a study spot near my place one night and I finally checked this out inside. I love it! The parking and drive-thru can get pretty crowded - the overall layout and construction of the drive-thru relevant to the other places in this corner are poorly executed. However, in the dozens of times I've been here both inside and in the drive-thru, the service ha been quick and excellent. The staff is friendly, and I always feel safe inside on days when I spend literally hours doing work here. Lots of workspaces and outlets for those working with technology. Love love love this location and would suggest it for anyone who's looking for a go-to Starbucks nearby.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 30, 2019~Excellent ambience. Just off the 51, and has an great east-bound view of Piestwa Peak, which I am currently enjoying looking at from the comfort of a leather armchair, accompanied by a delicious Americano and my favorite double-cooked butter croissant. Feeling good. :)
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Oct 17, 2018~Can be tough to get in and out of this busy corner, but app ordering makes this a quick stop!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 4, 2022~I've ordered on the freeway going through tunnel hoping my drink would be ready when I arrive. NOPE! This Starbucks is by far the slowest. The workers work like turtles and they could two craps about service. Drive down the road to the next Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Mar 19, 2017~Not a big fan of Starbucks until recently, I think this was my first visit to this location.I used to stay away from Starbucks because I try to do low carb and even their sugar free beverages may end up having tons of them.A few months ago I started asking for just plain coffee with heavy cream and I have bought more from there in the last year than in the past 20 years.Recently learned to place orders online, and my first experience was great at this Bethany Home and 16th St location. Plain and simple: coffee, heavy cream. I was on my way to Mesa, went through the drive-thru, got my drink, got on my way.Perfection.As a side note, I do not like my coffee very hot, so mobile orders ahead of time will work great for me : )
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jan 25, 2019~This is a ridiculous amount of ice, am I right??? Thanks Starbucks for a venti (mostly ice) tea, I could get a whole bag of ice for the same cost! The drive thru is otherwise pretty quick and efficient around lunchtime.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jul 22, 2018~Yesterday I was craving a green tea latte so I decided to order via drive thru. When I drove up to the window to receive my drink, the employee starts to hand me a brown colored drink and saying, `"here's your green tea latte`". I proceed to tell him that doesn't look like green tea. So I wait for them to make another one. No apology or anything btw. When I receive my green tea latte, it was obvious that they were in a hurry since a huge chunk of powder was sitting on the bottom. As I was driving on the freeway, I took a drink and got nothing but the powder and started choking on it. Luckily traffic wasn't horrible and I had some water to get the powder down. Will not be going to this location any longer! Waste of $5!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Dec 11, 2015~Scottie, beam me up. Wait, not just me but the entire store and transport it somewhere else because the physical location is a nightmare. Here is where you realize how many people live in the Greater Phoenix area or maybe it just seems as if everyone wanted a Starbucks fix at this location when I did.The arrangement of the interior is great, baristas can make a good tasting Starbucks drink, and I enjoyed my time, sipping my drink and reading my book here. I didn't, however, like trying to get into the parking lot nor out. I also elected not to sit outside, but that is just me. I'd rather enjoy my drink in a quiet area, more like the 32nd and Lincoln location, rather than hear the sounds of a busy intersection.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Nov 7, 2020~The coffee and service at this location was great! The horrible location spot unfortunately will always outweigh the service though! There is not enough room to have a drive thru. I had to wait in the drive thru line (which barely fits a standard vehicle) got my order, then had to wait through the line again to leave the shopping center. Having to wait twice is a waste of time!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Aug 6, 2018~This is one of the biggest, cleanest, most friendly Starbucks I've experienced in a looooong time!Tons of seating in a large dining area with pleasant music...great coffee AND a bit of atmosphere?! Loving it!!Mentioned what a nice impression I had to the person taking my order and she thanked me saying she just finished cleaning, even sweeping outside...essentially making it a Starbucks she would want to walk in to!  It turns out, she's the assistant manager, doing this for ten years and must be an amazing role model of pride &amp; excellence for Starbucks!  Thank you, Yen, you made my day!!This is the first of a three day golf tournament I'm competing in, and I'm for-sure stopping here each day to read my Vision 54 book in these comfy seats, drinking delicious coffee before I head out to warm up, play &amp; hopefully get the WIN!!Other Starbucks...please send your managers here to learn what you can do to elevate the customer experience! The world would be a better place for it!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Sep 19, 2020~Asothers have stated: this is a slow starbucks.  A rather nominal amount of customers but if you are more than 4 cars deep prepare to wait 20 minutes for your order.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jan 7, 2020~This is my favorite SB in the Valley! Everyone is friendly, I never wait long for any food or drink I order, and they keep the place clean. Occasionally, there will be kids from the local elementary that show up to hang out after school, but they're always well-behaved as the staff are quick to keep the noise levels down and everyone in check!  I have spent many hours here studying and doing homework and never once have had a bad experience. The parking lot is a little tricky to navigate though, but it's still a really convenient spot. Five out of five stars!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 15, 2021~i go here quite frequently but omg the fall drinks this year r so good  apple crisp macchiato slaps
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Aug 10, 2019~This is the closest one to me and unfortunately I now drive father away ... this is the SLOWEST DRIVE THRU LINE ... consistently out of product!!  So frustrating ... not sure if it's a staffing issue or what and I know customers don't always help with large orders, etc but this line is always crazy to wait all the time... especially when they are always out of food items
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jan 27, 2018~Came by this location on my birthday. I drove out of my way to make it there. When I arrived I informed them it's my birthday and I'd love to have my free birthday drink. After the hundreds I spend per year on starbucks, I was excited for it! The guy told me I needed the app....yeah okay I'll download it now. `"Oh no, you have to download it the day before your birthday, so what can I get for you???`" Ugh....I didn't have enough money on me and felt  humiliated on my birthday.What a cold company? Or is it just this snobby location? Either way, I'll be visiting Dutch Bros next time. What a cold company!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jul 27, 2013~I truly do favor locally-owned coffee shops, but depending on where I am in town Starbucks may have to do. This location is okay -- I've never had a problem with the service. This location has outdoor seating that faces the Bethany Home/16 St intersection. There's a nice view of the mountains to the northeast. Some other facets of the location I am compelled to warn you about. 1. Parking -- not much of it, and very tight. You risk being towed if you don't watch where you park. Other businesses are on this corner and they're very protective of their parking. 2. Getting in and out -- on the Bethany Home side, you really need to be driving east to turn in (right). Otherwise, it needs to be 8 p.m. On the 16th St side, you really need to turn right to go north on 16th -- turning left will hold up everyone behind you and you need to watch for traffic in at least 4 lanes. Again, to make a south turn on 16th St it really needs to be REALLY early in the morning or REALLY late at night. Any other time of day and you're asking for a fender-bender. It's an okay location; you just need to be careful how you come in and leave, and where you park.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Feb 12, 2017~Slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow!Waiting in drive thru for 8 minutes for two iced drinks!These people would never make it in a large city!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jan 1, 2020~The ONE TIME I go here because dutch is too busy it takes 10 whole minutes to receive my order. Makes no sense as to why there are only 2 employees working at 4pm on a Wednesday. Also, maybe tell the employees that they shouldn't be having full on conversations whilst doing everything one at a time when there is a massive line. That is exactly why I never go to Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Dec 1, 2018~Green matcha tea for the road  is always my favorite. A must always. Clean, organized, and fast.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Apr 18, 2010~The line for this drive thru wrapped around the building and took FOREVER to move.  I realized why when I finally got to the window to pick up my grande coffee.  I wasn't even acknowledged to pay for at least 2 minutes and then it took another minute to get my coffee.  I can't imagine how much longer I would have waited for a soy latte.Normally I would run in and get my coffee but it was an early Saturday morning after a late night.  I wasn't willing to get out of the car.  In any case, next time I'm heading up to the drive thru at Glendale and 16th for a cup at McDonald's.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jan 23, 2020~This place has no high chairs :( lap baby plus hot coffee isn't a good mix. I'm not sure if that's a thing at all Starbucks locations but I asked and they Said they are none. I needed a break so I came here but didn't get one.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 4, 2019~I have stopped a few times at this location and usually they are fast service and somewhat friendly. This morning I stopped by to get an iced caramel macchiato and they gave me a hot one instead. Then I asked if they could add whipped cream so they took it back for a minute and handed it back to me with no whipped cream. I didn't check it. I trusted them. It's always disappointing to not get what you asked for. I always ask for almond milk and never realized they charge more for almond milk that's because they stop giving out receipts but then I opt out of classic syrup all the time isn't that an offset to the cost of the almond milk. I'm saving them pumps of sugary syrup!  :(
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Mar 6, 2019~This is the worst Starbucks on the planet. They mess up my drink every time, I will not be back. 2 stars only because I love Starbucks. I'm so tired of getting the wrong drink and it being incredibly slow that I'm leaving my 2nd yelp review ever. Here's a picture of my `"cold brew, with sweet cream cold foam`"--- its a latte or something.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Mar 17, 2020~Went here around 30 min before they closed and the worker Alex gave me my drink and cheese danish at a perfect timing. I usually get a tall pink drink with xtra xtra strawberries and TRY to remember light ice!!! I forgot to order light ice at the window but when I paid I tried asking to see if he can make it with light ice and he said he already did! I got my drink and it was perfect! I really appreciate the time he took to make my drink. Not a lot of Starbucks workers will ease off the ice. It really felt like he enjoyed his job and had a good heart. Very talented person.I know he can go places. A kind soul. I would give him a raise. Thank you Alex. My drink was delicious.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 5, 2019~Everyone is very welcoming and friendly at this location. I didn't have to wait in line too long inside and it was a busy morning. Car is always awesome when he takes your order. He gets your order in quickly and finds a way to connect with each customer! As a former starbucks barista it's pretty impressive to watch him work.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Sep 30, 2019~Went here for awhile when I worked across the way, couple people are nice. But for the most part this location is unprofessional, and one guy I wish I knew his name... he had black hair and younger, was super rude and gave a heck of a lot of attitude when I was ordering... drinks sometimes were made wrong or watered down. Wouldn't go to this location unless I absolutely had to. Now that I don't work near it I'll never be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jun 1, 2017~This Starbucks is the closest to my house, otherwise I wouldn't go here. It's crazy to get in and out of due to the configuration of the parking spot but more than that, the service is horrible.Yesterday, after paying with my app in the drive thru the woman handed me my drink without a word. I said 'thanks, have a good day,' before she responded with 'ok,' before turning away. Today, it took 5 times of repeating a very simple order before the woman got it right.I get Starbucks are a dime a dozen lately, but this is why I will usually drive further to go to Dutch Brothers where they provide true, friendly service.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Mar 4, 2019~I used to come in here in the mornings and they always got my order one hundred percent correct, but it seems the night crew always has trouble understanding what a venti hot green tea is. When I am not feeling well, their green tea is the best at soothing a sore throat! I know I can't make it at home, but when it's done right, it just tastes better. I don't know why it's so complicated to understand, but 90 percent of the time when I order the drink, they get it wrong. They usually decide that I need a cold drink instead of a warm drink. Sometimes it's a frappachino and tonight they decided I needed a green tea latte (maybe because it was a couple dollars more). This is a waste of my time and not the quality of service I have come to expect.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Apr 22, 2019~Too often a `"chain`" restaurant means you'll get the same mediocre customer service everywhere, but at this Starbucks, if you're lucky enough to have Aubrey make your drink, take a minute to talk coffee with her. Or better yet, test her skills and knowledge with a special request. You won't be disappointed! First rate barista puts this store well above the rest!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 5, 2017~My fiancé and I went through the drive thru today as we are heading out of state on a long road trip. The lady at the window handed him a drink with a faulty lid that wasn't even on completely. It spilled all over the car. She watched the whole thing with out saying a word of offering any sort of help. My fiancé asked for napkins and she was so slow that I had already found napkins in the glove box and began cleaning it. I was quite disappointed that someone in customer service would be so thoughtless. Accidents happen but she could have at least been willing to offer help. Highly recommend checking your lid before they hand you your drink, although I do believe it is their job to check that the lid is secure before handing a drink through the window.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jan 28, 2016~5 years, I've been hittin this Starbucks. Five years.It has a drive thru- and I get my coffee made the way I like it every time. Going into this store for a drink is fine, but the drive thru moves faster. All the employees are nice and smiley.It's got plenty of seating, a gigantic patio and even misters. Typically full of work-from-laptop peeps and students and not any loungey type seats except for a few leatherette chairs near the pick up window. The wi-fi always works great for me on the old iPhone. It's located on a mondo-busy corner, so you might not be cool with making a left turn onto 16th St. out of the parking lot unless you're over-insured. The jay-walking pedestrians and volume of traffic would be difficult to avoid running into.*Pro tip- avoid between 2:45-4pm unless you want to wait in line behind 50 high school kids, and that's down from 100 kids since Dutch Bros opened nearby.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jan 15, 2019~Open until 11pm and they have it ready pronto. I wish they were all open this late or later. Its the main reason i go to this one (because if I need to stop during the day then just about any location will do).
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 7, 2016~Open until 11pm and they have it ready pronto. I wish they were all open this late or later. Its the main reason i go to this one (because if I need to stop during the day then just about any location will do).
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Mar 2, 2019~Stopped here this morning to order coffee and breakfast. While I wanted a Cinnamon Shortbread Latte, and their menu still showed it, we were told they no longer have it. Okay, I ordered a Cinnamon Dolce Latte with an add shot and blueberry oatmeal. I also ordered a Ventilator Carmel Macchiato and Ham and Cheese Egg Bites for my friend. Now I understand that orders can get backed up, but there was only one car in front of us and after waiting for about 5 minutes we were asked to pull around the front, into the handicap spot, to wait for our food. We did so, but we're both confused. Why would someone tell us to pull into that spot? What if a handicap person actually needed the one spot they have? I just thought it was kind of foolish on their part. Flash forward, we get to work and his Macchiato tastes like it is warm milk. There is no Carmel and tastes like there is no coffee. I tried to call them directly and try to resolve the issue, but the phone number that is online keeps going to what sounds like a home answering machine.At this rate I'm probably going to just start taking the extra time and going to Luci's Marketplace across the street.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 12, 2018~Great service here and very delicious Mocha's and cookies here. And plus the drive-thru line goes by quicker than the Dutch Bros line.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Mar 11, 2016~This is the closest drive-thru Starbucks for me and since I take my dog with me everywhere, I need a drive thru. It's right on the southeast corner of the intersection in a tight little corner so the parking there and drive thru can sometimes be frustrating. The drinks have been good and the customer service is ok (could be a lot better) which is why I had to give them 3 stars.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Dec 19, 2020~Best! They are always busy, but I always get the best tasting lattes from here and friendly staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 28, 2018~The employees at this Starbucks are wonderful people!  They are attentive and pleasant, they keep the cafe clean, and they are efficient!  Couldn't ask for a better Starbucks experience anywhere!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jan 30, 2016~This is a wonderful starbucks a great bunch of employees very cheerful and very pleasant in fact some have relocated to this starbucks from the one i always got to because of how close it is to my home But this location is worth yhe drive to see happy faces .this location maybe be a little crazy of the placement of the store on the corner of the street but it is so nicely kept up area is always clean and like i said they have all my best batistas 100% i will tell everyone about this location the best
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 21, 2018~Went through the drive thru yesterday ordered a tea with soy. Drank about half before realizing it tasted off and was more than likely because it wasn't soy milk. Now I know it wasn't because I'm up at 4am with extreme cramps having a lactose attack. Please pay more attention to drink orders and follow them exact I'm physically ill now because of this.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Feb 10, 2015~Great attitudes, plenty of seating, and a talented group of baristas make this store an exemplary example of how a Starbucks should look and run. They listen and make your cup just the way you want it. Some big fluffy chairs, regular tables, outside seating, and stools make a satisfactory seat for every type of butt. The worst parking lot ever. The drive thru line wraps around the store and they have zero room for you to back out of parking spaces. If the drive thru line is long, you are essentially waiting in the line in order to pull out. The location has parking spots beyond the drive thru, but there are signs saying the spots are for Bethany shoppers only. I do not drink here at peak times because of the parking lot.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Aug 8, 2012~I came here to get some work done on the laptop and since they list their hours as open until 11:00pm I figured I could get more done than by going to Lux who close at 10:00pm.I was not a happy camper when, at 10:22pm,  I was informed that `"the lobby is closing in 10 minutes`" They need to change their posted hours because I would not have come here if I knew I was going to have grab my coffee, pack up and leave.I prefer to patronize local coffee establishments anyway, so I should have stuck to my guns.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Mar 6, 2009~Above and Beyond Service  One morning I ordered an Americano, and when I got to the counter to pick up my drink, I realized that I forgot to order the piadini I had wanted, and the line was too long to go back through. The barista must have noticed my heavy sigh, asked what was wrong, and I explained.  She stepped away from the coffee machine and returned minutes later with a piadini `"take care of it next time and have a great day`" she said.  Wow.  That has NEVER happened to me anywhere!  (I did pay for it the next time).  A couple  weeks ago, I ordered an Americano and piadini at the drive thru (yes, I can be a creature of habit), and when I got to the window they told me the total I owed  - it was so low that I said `"you must have forgotten my piadini`"  They had the piadini ready for me but had not rung it up, so they told me it was on the house.  Wow.  Earlier this evening I stopped in for a coffee and as always received quick, friendly and professional service.  Many other Starbucks are staffed by teenagers about as excited to serve me as they are to do court-ordered community service.  Not at 16th and Bethany - these people seem genuinely happy I've stoppped in and want me to return.  Kudos to the staff!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Mar 30, 2011~5 stars for the wide open spaces! We all know that Starbuck's drinks are all standard, pretty much.So when I look at stores I look for the outlets and the tables...I guess also the location.When ever you go into a Starbucks, no matter what location you instantly feel your in a different place...the company's interior design gets me every time, the insistent Feng Shui is just so relaxing and productive. Or maybe its all in my head..ha!I like this location because of the outlets and the tables...all very accommodating. I am purest so I don't mess with Carmel frapps or the peppermint mochas...tall coffee or black passion tea for me my coffee artisans of 16th st and BethHome....and let the caffeine pass through my veins...stirring my inner most career ambitions! l'chaim!    R\_
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Dec 22, 2011~This location offers horrible parking and is always busy.But, they have an oven, meaning they are able to serve their breakfast sandwiches.The Baristas are also all very friendly and do a good job of cleaning up (quickly) after people who are too lazy to throw their empty cups, napkins, ect in the trash.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jul 3, 2020~Just ordered a grande cold brew with sweet cream... my trenta I usually order is cheaper then this form other places... was I overcharged or does every Starbucks dictates their own price ??
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Apr 4, 2011~It's not local. It's not new. It's not subverting the dominant paradigm.It is, however, the only coffee drive through for a significant radius in this part of town. I live north and west, and work south and east of this particular location. Every time I stop by my drive-thru clerk is cheerful, introduces his- or herself, suggests a signature drink, and very often compliments my haircut when I get to the window. All of these things I appreciate, especially when coupled with consistently tasty beverages - right now I'm loving the short peppermint latte - served in the comfort of my own automobile (say that like you're in Sixteen Candles). It's always highly populated, make sure that you enter the parking lot from 16th Street - it's easier to get into the line from that direction. If you only have 5 minutes and you can't make a u-turn on a residential street, this location might not be for you. Please, keep your patient hats on! However, a suburban is able to negotiate the drive-thru and parking lot without a problem.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 30, 2019~Very frustrated with this location. It is such a cluster mess to get in and out of this place, drive thru and the parking is just a complete mess as I'm sure others can attest to, however, sometimes it's my only option driving to work in the morning. My advice stay away from here unless you want an extra headache before your morning cup of coffee. I have many times left aggravated and unfulfilled asking myself why I continue to pay inflated coffee prices, and they continue to run out of things. It's for the convenience I guess, but this place is not convenient or consistent. My Skinny Caramel Macchiato topped with cinnamon powder never tastes the same. This may seem insignificant but to be out of cinnamon powder for two weeks in a row which I like on on my $5.50 cup of coffee unacceptable.  Really? Come on... head to the store on your way into work, Manager person... and just keep it until your order comes in, or whatever the case. Grrr.. it's happened to me a few times with them being out of stuff.  So with Starbucks on every corner, I'm staying away from this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~May 20, 2017~Closest Starbucks to me. Not bad but usually somewhat slow for a Starbucks. Drive through like usually takes a chunk of time.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Apr 21, 2015~Nice location to go have a drink of coffee, meet-up for a chat, or complete work. I enjoy going there because of the friendly staff, great customer service, and the indoor/outdoor option for seating.Additionally, when needing to find a Starbucks that isn't too quite but not loud as well, this location will fit your needs. I continue to go here and recommend it to anyone looking for a good cup of joe and space comfortable for what you are looking for!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Dec 7, 2011~Love the S-Bux. Would give this place FIVE stars since it does have expanded hours and ample seating accommodations BUT....Parking here is terrible, awkward, and sometimes dangerous. When things get crazy in the am sometimes the drive-through line can actually gridlock patrons in the parking lot... hard to describe but once you see this place you will understand.REALLY wish this place would go 24 hrs... its only closed for like 4-5 hours so why the heck not?!?!?!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jan 18, 2014~The staff here is great and normally make my drinks perfectly. As everyone else has stated, the parking and drive through are a mess. Getting in and out requires another level of patience. But if you go during off peak hours you can typically get in and out pretty quickly. Overall it's one of the better Starbucks I've been to.Skinny caramel machiatto is the best!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Nov 15, 2017~It's a busy location. Always a long line in the morning so be prepare to wait. The redhead inside, don't ask her for anything it seemed like we were a bother. The lady next to me asked for a spoon, the girl never acknowledged her and when she did get her the spoon, tossed it from the other side of the back counter ... it slid on the counter towards the lady and she was not happy. When I finally could get her attention after 5 minutes of standing there waiting for my mobile order she was like it's over there. You guys it's by the register and not where you pick up drinks. A waste of my time and defeated the whole purpose of a mobile order.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jun 15, 2014~This is the largest Starbucks I have even been into. The staff was friendly. There is even an outside area. My only problem was a parking problem.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 8, 2019~Awful service yesterday morning-Kyle or whatever his name is didn't have a clue how to run the drive thru. I wanted a coffee and protein box and he could barely take my coffee order and told me `"remind me when you get up here about your protein box- got up to the window got my coffee and reminded him about the protein box and he waved his finger at me because he was taking another order... geez I just left and won't EVER be back to this location. Horrible service
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 10, 2017~I just love coming through this drive through! They are always so sweet and complimentative and really fast! Don't be scared to go through the drive through, they make it happen  Thank you for the wonderful customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Mar 20, 2015~The parking is a mess because the people who work here actually get to know their customers!I started my love of Starbucks by a friend who was a barista would bring me random concoctions. Ten years later I can't shake my love. It's more than coffee- it's that dream where you have your own Central Perk.  You are a character in your own life.  People know and remember you!Zachary is my favorite window- barista because he has that way of making me relive that moment when my friend worked there... Except now I have to pay. `"What can I get started for you?`" He knows I'll vary between an iced unsweetened green tea and bistro box- to a hot grande nonfat  caramel macchiato and a warmed blueberry yoghurt muffin.  Like how many times do I randomly get the spinach feta wrap and venti iced breve coffee?  A lot.  No matter what I appreciate him always asking how I am doing.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Nov 14, 2010~This particular location always has a crowd but the wait is never long &amp; I've never experienced a bad drink here :)The guy at the drive-thru window saw my dog in the car with me and offered him a `"Pupiccino`" LOL ( whipped cream in a small cup )
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Aug 14, 2018~I am a frequent customer. I was here every single morning without fail unless for a trip that took me out of town. I got to know a wonderful staff and group of people. This was a special location and how all starbucks should be run. However there is completely new management, which is atrocious. New management made changes and brought in lazy employees. All the amazing people working here transferred locations or left all together. The new staff is not friendly. The new staff closes early. The new staff is a fake friendly. When the previous staff took the time to get to know everyone. I am appalled with new management. Old management was always on the floor helping the team. New management is always sitting down not doing anything. If management sets the precedence around the store... the new employees definitely follow the lead. The remaining staff from previous management is still outstanding.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Dec 5, 2016~This has to be the slowest SB ever...there's no one here....I asked for a Venti waited ten MINS and when I finally got it it was a grande....another couple of mins...but I will come back again...just need more workers
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 4, 2020~I have never gotten through this drive through in less than 15 minutes. Not once. Whether there are two cars in front of me or five. It's incredibly slow, and more than twice I've been given the wrong breakfast sandwich or drink. I understand that this is an extremely busy location, but I've been in long queues at other Starbucks and they have moved faster so it must be a management/staff issue. I've also been language policed by one of the drive thru attendants. I was speaking to another person in the car actually, and it was in excitement (when I found out they still had a drink I liked I exclaimed `"F*ck yes!!`") yet the smug attendant said `"could you please not use that language sir? Thank you`" through the speaker. It was very embarrassing. Then, to add insult to injury when we got to the window he added `"that language is not music to everyone's ears`" before giving me the wrong sandwich and an incorrect drink. Pretty ridiculous to be scolded like a fourth grader by a sanctimonious drive-thru attendant. I had the same gentleman today who - once again- gave me the wrong sandwich even though it was correct on the screen. Maybe pay more attention to the details of your job than tone policing your customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 21, 2010~Fast service, lots of chairs, nice outdoor seating.  great location straight off of 51.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 29, 2016~Awfully expensive for them to forget the Carmel in the Carmel macchiato and fill my PSL halfway. Finally, done with Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Oct 3, 2006~Why it is good:-Drive ThruThe Bad:-Lots of traffic in an extremely small parking lot- They dont know how to make a Vanilla Tea Latte... technically this is all starbucks, but it makes me angry that the one by my house cant try to figure out how to make one. - Kills Ma and Pop coffee shops (as a company)
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Aug 3, 2016~The past two times I come in in I ask for the green tea with lemonade, they never give it to me, they always give me unsweetened peach tea for some odd reason...are their employees incapable of listening to their customers? I'm not coming back a waste of money!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jun 30, 2016~The drive thru is a nightmare!!! The service is slow, there should be no reason to wait 10 min in the drive thru when there are only 2 cars in front of me. The traffic congestion is ridiculous based on the setup of the parking lot. If they were setup with staff that would direct traffic during the busy morning hours, it would be tolerable.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 18, 2019~Thank you to the team here on Wednesday morning 9/18! Everyone was hustling and in a great mood. One of the baristas at the hand off noticed I was sitting after I got my drink and asked if I was waiting for something else. I was waiting for a breakfast sandwich and figured they just had a few in front of me and i wasn't in a hurry, but she made sure it got put in right away. The girl who took my order (kae? Or Rae? I'm sorry I can't remember!) even remembered my name and delivered my sandwich to me. Way to make the moment right guys! Keep up the great work.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jan 20, 2012~Having come here (inside) every day for a few weeks, I can say this is one of the slowest, most disorganized, poorly managed Sbux I've ever been to. Maddening!Two registers but only one is utilized. The flow of staff buzzing around is as comical as it is inefficient.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jul 9, 2016~I wish i could give this Starbucks a better rating and review but, i feel like each time i come here. I visit almost every week because I work at the Walmart store by them, It seems as if this particular barista tall and dark skin lady that takes my order at the register has a bad attitude. I have nothing against this Starbucks store I appreciate their business and it's my favorite coffee place to go to, I am a gold member because of how much I love Starbucks, I really don't understand why each time i get serviced by that lady my order is always wrong, sorry If i dont remember her name, i tried describing her to the best of my knowledge. When I visit this particular location I get my order taken by her, she gives me a dirty look as if i did something wrong and she really doesn't want to see me, if she's there and takes my order it is made wrong and when my drink is made right in which I would be surprised It takes longer than it should to the point I'm the last one standing there waiting patiently even if i feel a little upset about the wait.I would completely understand if their busy but everyone who ordered after me would get there order first, i'm currently writing this review while still waiting for my favorite drink, Iced matcha green tea latte, I'm just really bothered that I have noticed how many times this continuously happens.I am not a bad customer who likes to yell or make a scene, I would just appreciate it if they change their attitude and behavior towards customers that is not Starbucks motto.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Oct 14, 2016~Everything everyone else has said about the drive-thru is true. This is an impossible location when it is busy. You either can't get on the drive-thru line or you get stuck in the exit line, or every open spot that might allow you to go inside is labeled with a big `"no Starbucks parking`" sign. It's a mess. If you go on off hours however, it is lovely inside with nice staff,  lots of seating, and everything you would expect from a large Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Apr 21, 2018~I think you need to fire your civil engineers who designed the drive thru.... the exit of the drive thru has to wait for the one lane entrance of the drive thru car gets out of the way?!?!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Feb 5, 2017~They cannot get the order right! We ordered two iced caramel macchiatos one with extra Carmel and the other with extra vanilla. The one with extra vanilla didn't have vanilla but had three extra shots in it. Went to have it remade and the gal gave us milk with hardly any coffee. We got home and drank the new drinks and found white chunks floating everywhere inside it. Not only are they rude but they can't make the right order. Never going back their competitors are ten times better.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Apr 5, 2016~We get coffee 3-4 nights a week. I mentioned to my fiancé they haven't been giving us full cups of the drinks we have been ordering. Tonight takes the cake! Nowhere near a grande.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Dec 2, 2015~Love Starbucks but this location should be closed. Whoever thought that a crowded drive through at the intersection of 26th and Bethany home was a good idea was wrong. Traffic is negatively affected by this store and the parking lot is really dangerous.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jan 20, 2019~The drive through is poorly conceived and gets insanely clogged at peak times. I waited 20 minutes to order and couldn't get out of the line because it traps cars in. Won't go back.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Feb 13, 2015~Quick and efficient. The batistas are always friendly and most importantly get my drinks made correctly. They laugh at my jokes even though my wife doesn't find them funny so that's always a plus. Don't forget the valentine's day specials they have going on. Love coming to this starbucks. Now time to get back to work.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Sep 27, 2016~This would be a five-star review if it weren't for the fact that the drive-thru situation can be absolutely impossible if it is a busy time of the day.  Otherwise, I have nothing but compliments for this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Sep 6, 2020~I went through the drive thru and told the baristas my order and when I received my order I noticed some things were wrong but I didn't throw a big fit till we drove away and I started to notice all my drinks were wrong it was my order but they didn't make my drinks right and I asked for two cookie dough cake pops got 1 cookie dough and another one chocolate so I was like okay woah this is definitely wrong. I called and told them it was wrong and it's funny because even on the sticker it says my order the way I ordered it but it's still wrong it amazes me. And so they tell me that I can come back and get a recovery order I go back and I tell them my order go fix it and I ask for an extra two cookie dough cake pops I wanted to pay for those two because I didn't order them the first time but the barista I'm sure her name was Alisa said I was good so I was  like oh okay and she repeated to me asking if I did want an extra two so it's not like she forgot. And when I get my recovery drinks only 1 of them is wrong I asked for pumpkin foam but still got the vanilla and didn't get those two extra cake pops which I'm not as upset about. I work at a Starbucks as well and it amazes me how much they have failed Starbucks not once but twice they mess it up and don't take the time and consideration of actually doing their drinks right I get not everyone's perfect but there definitely needs to be some work done because that's just sad for Starbucks hope you guys get better.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Nov 8, 2018~This location is hit or miss at best. Staff turnover is rampant.  There doesn't seem to be much accountability or management. Some of the staff are terrific and things always run better when Nick is working.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 12, 2018~I am a frequent flyer of Starbucks. I spend at least $10 a day stopping at Starbucks. This by far is the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. I have given this location at least half a dozen attempts at redeeming themselves. I have visited during peak hours and off-peak hours, they are still severely incompetent. One time I sat in line in the drive-through for 17 minutes only to pull up to the window for them to tell me they did not have what I ordered. Given it was the only thing I ordered, I was extremely frustrated. Today, I arrived with one person in front of me and two people in the lobby. I ordered a large pink drink and a large ice water. The gentleman taking my order was wearing a headpiece which I believe is why he had to ask me three times to repeat my order. After placing my order I waited 21 minutes for my pink drink and after 24 minutes I left without my ice water. This is completely unacceptable. AVOID this disaster!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Nov 12, 2012~This is usually my favorite Starbucks, it's a shame that their employee today told me a lie that has to be repeated here.  I pull up to the drive-thru this evening, and they tell me that they're out of Chai, and that so are all the other Starbucks in the area.  This sounded like bullshit, so I drove to the next closest Starbucks, and what did I find?  Chai!Why the lies, Starbucks?
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 24, 2013~Went through the drive thru to get some coffee and water today. It was a rather long wait, but when we finally got to the window they gave us our drinks for FREE! Such a nice and pleasant surprise. Thanks Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Apr 22, 2018~The staff here are incredible. They work hard, fast, efficiently and are always enthusiastic and friendly. Highly, highly recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jul 23, 2016~I debated on writing a review or not, but decided that I should. I live in Scottsdale, but on the 4th of July I was down in Fountain Hills. After the firework show that I was attending I really wanted a granita from Starbucks, so my boyfriend and I decided to drive like mad people to get to a location before they closed. Our first goal was the location on Scottsdale and Thunderbird but it occurred to us that it wasn't going to happen. Then we called the Bethany Home location and realized we had plenty of time to make it despite the long drive. We got there three minutes before close and tried to walk inside to be quicker, but they already had the inside locked. The guy inside cleaning wasn't even going to open the door to talk to us and when he did he was extremely rude and rubbed us the wrong way. We then had to hop in the drive through where they wouldn't take us or the car in front of us. We were SO frustrated after driving thirty plus minutes and then being denied our drinks. I work at Dutch Bros and we always serve the line of cars that we have even if it's past closing.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jan 21, 2015~This Starbucks is located inside the Target at Christown Mall. Service is usually decent. Imnot wild about the constant turnover of youngsters behind the counter  but I always get my drink quickly. I keep asking them to add a shot of Jamison but no luck yet. Sometimes there is a little gabfest between the employee and one of their friends but it's not a big deal.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 9, 2018~I got a PSL here this morning that just wasn't up to snuff so I came back during my lunch to get let them know and the cashier offered to make me another, in a larger size, no questions asked. Amazing service!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Aug 22, 2013~This Starbucks closes late so that's the upside it has a cool patio and the inside is nice just the one thing I have to complain about is the Internet it sucks but I you come here for anything else it's all good.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 28, 2014~I went through the drive-thru a few days ago. I realized after I pulled away that I had forgotten to ask for whipped cream on the one I got for my friend. It was very busy when I went in......I was in a big hurry, my lunch break was just about over.  There was a guy bent over one of the tables picking up trash who overheard me asking for whipped cream to be put on top of one of my drinks......he stood up smiled at me and said he would be happy to do that for me. While doing it he asked me how my day was going, I said fine ....he  then thanked me for choosing Starbucks and to please come again soon.  I was  impressed with his friendly customer service so i asked what his name was  they said it was Brian.  Thank you Brian,  just one more reason to keep coming back to my favorite Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 21, 2012~I love this place and the new look inside...  Coffee is the same, it's Starbucks people...!   But seriously, do something about the brutally slow internet....  : (
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jan 8, 2015~Dam forget about going through the drive thru in the morning unless you like waiting a long time.  In a word location on the corner and if you park to go in with that drive thru line you be stuck for a bit til it moves.  No other complaint it's another typical Starbucks just as good as all the other ones.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 12, 2012~I thought I was going to die without my caffeine fix.  The drive thru line took forever and the parking lot was full.  I don't understand why after the service I got.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Mar 24, 2013~Drive thru is super fast and employees are courteous and helpful. Always smiling, Keep it up guys!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jun 27, 2017~So I've decided to stop coming to this location. I've tried to give this place a chance 3 or 4 times, but they fail me EVERY time! They ALWAYS screw up the drinks I order! Sometimes they forget to add the flavor, forget whip, or do not stir the drink like I asked! These were all on separate drink orders! The staff is rude and unapologetic and roll their eyes when you ask them to fix their mistake! It even says what I ordered in the label of the cup and they STILL mess it up! The parking lot is a mess. Just tear this location down!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jan 2, 2016~The service and staff have always been A-OK, but the 3 star review is strictly for the parking situation. I visit this location about 3 times a week and at least 1 if not 2 of those times I almost end up in a fender bender. The parking and drive thru situation is absolutely atrocious. As for the rest of the location it has a nice inside and lots of local morning regulars which is nice.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Aug 7, 2012~One of the only Starbucks I've seen with the swamp misters outisde. Pretty cool. They had some good jams playing inside as well and the gentlemen behind the counter had a strong southern accent, so obviously this is my new favorite place on Earth.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Aug 23, 2014~Wow, I have never received such crappy service in my life. The Barista must've worked for the welfare office or dmv, or another city service job, cause her attitude showed. Sometimes these people forget what they do and who they work for. Avoid this location, either go to the on on camelback or 7 st.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Apr 30, 2017~This location has let me down several times in the past, BUT NOT THIS MORNING! The barista that helped me was super pleasant, extremely generous, and fast!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Oct 6, 2012~This drive thru is ALWAYS busy, so get here early and don't be in a rush! However, the staff is always very quick and cheery, and they always get my day started right by simply being in such a good mood, despite their cranky customers! Thanks guys!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jul 19, 2014~Great staff. Super friendly. Ordered a caramel frapp. Tasted good. Kudos for spelling my name right. Location is very big and super clean inside. Outside seating area is there for those willing to melt outside. Can't forget about the free wifi
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 18, 2010~Anne W's review is spot-on.  This Starbucks location is always very welcoming both when I go inside and in the drive thru.  Very consistent and dependable when I am in need of a caffiene kick in the butt.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Mar 5, 2012~I enjoy this Starbucks and believe me all of them are different. Love how they make chi tea lattes here but their service is just so so sometimes I prefer the drive through at this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Dec 1, 2012~Most friendly Starbucks staff ever! Never had a drink made wrong. Yes the drive- thru can get extremely busy, they get the drinks out really fast!! I always choose this Starbucks over the one closer to my house.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jul 22, 2015~Slowest drive thru ever and the parking lot often gets congested and you cannot get in and out of the drive thru. I have also had my drink messed up more than a couple of times at this location. Not my favorite Starbucks location.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 19, 2015~I was literally the 8th person in line, the drive thru had about 6-7 cars in line, and I was still out in less than 3 minutes... And my drink is not an easy fast drink to make.... Love love love this location... And Tanya and Justine the manager
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jun 24, 2012~The location of this Starbucks makes it ideal for a lot of business meetings which also means that it is always crowded.  The drive-thru is always long and parking is limited. The staff is friendly though and I have never been disappointed with my order.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Aug 6, 2012~Fast and friendly service. If you just want a coffee with no frills, this is the place for you.Nothing particularly outstanding about this location. If you like atmosphere, an eclectic and diverse vibe with more colorful people to people watch, Lux is more for you. The patrons here are about as drab,generic and uninteresting as the decor and about as vanilla as the lattés. 3 stars solely for the baristas.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jan 20, 2012~If you like coconut, then you have to try the new coconut frappacino's. They taste like a Samoa girl scout cookie blended in a cup. I'm usually an iced coffee kind-of-girl but when I sampled this wonder drink, I changed my order and enjoyed a little sip of paradise instead.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 20, 2015~Visited this location on April 19, 2015 and used my app to pay for my coffee.  I use the app for the free refills it offers.  Until I met Tanya.  She was most unhelpful and unhappy and charged me for the refills after debating the process with me.  I then contacted the manager via email and have yet to hear from them... Get your coffee elsewhere, I suggest Luci's where the staff is friendly and refills are generously provided each and every time.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jan 8, 2015~This Starbucks is awesome. They're always so good at what they do. It's clean, they're friendly. The bathrooms are always up to par. The partners are awesome and they're good at what they do. Very rarely, I've had to send a drink back and they fix it with no complaint.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jan 8, 2015~This Starbucks is awesome. The staff are attentive and fast. I've been going here, on and off, for almost 10 years. I never have a complaint about this store. It's always clean and they're really good about keeping the bathrooms clean. The food and drinks are always up to standard and if anything is wrong, the partners always are good (and polite) about fixing it.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Dec 28, 2016~I love getting coffee and cakes from Starbucks because it's such a yummy combo, but I will NEVER come to this Starbucks again. I came here two days ago and the barista forgot to add cream to my coffee. I thought, `"No big deal, I'll  just add it at the prep station.`" Then today, I asked the same barista for a piece of the marble pound cake and to give me a middle piece because the end pieces are thick and dry- I get in the car, about to take a bite into my mid afternoon snack &amp; what do I see?? Not only did he grab the wrong cake (it had cinnamon in it- which triggers my nasal allergies), but I got an end piece. It's hard enough that I have to ensure I do my job accurately,  but now, I have to babysit others in doing a simple task of picking not only the correct product, but ensuring that it's not the dry one either. I'm done &amp; give up on this place. I only wish that there would have been a Dutch Brothers instead of Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Apr 23, 2014~The baristas are friendly and the coffee is tasty but DO NOT go here in the morning if you are trying to get somewhere on time. The drive-thru and parking is a mess!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Apr 23, 2014~I go here very often, and the staff is always wonderful to me. They almost always get my complicated order down. On the occasion they make a mistake they are quick to fix it and very nice about it. The entire staff deserves to be rewarded for always being outstanding. Thank you!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Nov 13, 2016~Not only were the drinks wonderful, but the customer service blew my mind. I had a huge blister on my foot and Alexis went and searched for a band aid and saved our whole day. Alexis is the real MVP and I love him.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Sep 11, 2014~Nastiest strawberry smoothie....it tasted more like banana and barely barely could taste the strawberries a side from it being brown not pink.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jul 31, 2016~Always out of something.  3rd time this week I have tried to get a caramel waffle cone Frappuccino and they are out.  You're a coffee shop who recently raised your prices and now to me you suck.  I'll go to Dutch Brothers from now on.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Feb 8, 2015~Great service! This store is apparently really popular -- they do a great job of getting customers through the line and with the perfect drink. They also always have the pastries I like. Friendly, clean, helpful -- and FAST!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~May 1, 2016~Evidently the staff is very poorly trained. I am sitting here drinking a coffee inside and a woman  has a dog here. And it's not a service dog. I assume Phoenix has a a health code.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Nov 20, 2015~Everything is perfect except the AC is too strong and cold. I know we living in the desert area. But it is still very chill !
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Nov 16, 2014~I would give this place 5 stars because their service is always superb, and they always make perfect drinks. The reason for the 2 star rating? This drive-thru is HANDS DOWN the BIGGEST CLUSTERF*CK I have ever experienced!!! I have been to this Starbucks 50+ times over the year, and RARELY has the drive-thru run easily. When there is a line, and a car enters from 16th street, they try to get in line, both blocking anybody from leaving the (one way direction) Starbucks parking lot, as well as preventing anybody from being able to turn into the complex off 16th street, OR leave the complex on 16th street. Cars just end up sitting at a stand-still, and I have been stuck trying to exit at times for up to 15 minutes. Why can't they put up a barrier? They really, REALLY need to figure out a way to get this running smoothly, or a lot of their business is going to be lost to the new Dunkin Donuts across the street. Sure, you're not getting your Pumpkin Spiced Whatever the Heck, but for those who just need coffee, it's way easier. GET IT TOGETHER, STARBUCKS!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Oct 6, 2013~It is Starbucks after all, nothing special about this place.  When you really need a coffee and/or sweet things and there aren't any places around you, you take what you can have.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Apr 11, 2015~The drive thru is a mess as you barely have enough room.  Other than that they are super friendly!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jun 22, 2014~love the remodel this past year and friendly staff.  beware of the drivethrough!  does get blocked up and people get upset.  relax, take your time and don't be in too much of a rush.  not worth getting upset if it takes a couple extra minutes to get your coffee or leave...
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Apr 8, 2015~The drive-thru setup is a total cluster F. Trying to get in and out in the morning is a disaster.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 23, 2015~nice place to meet up with any friends and specially to get the best coffee. Friendly staff and customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Mar 12, 2011~I am a very frequent Starbucks visitor. Yes, it is a big chain and do prefer to frequent locally owned shops, I go to Starbucks because overall they are generally consistent. I frequently drink chai soy lattes. How difficult could this to be to make. Consistently,  they are terrible at this one particular starbucks. I don't know why. I hope who ever reads this reviews from Starbucks finds out. And if they're not reading this.. `"tisk, tisk`"
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~May 10, 2011~great coffee!! drive thru makes it ten times better.     when im on the rush there is no time to go in i just            make my way thru the drive thru;)
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Nov 14, 2013~Staff is very friendly and always on point!  Not to mention... Some really cute guys working behind the counter... Just sayin!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jul 2, 2021~Sometimes it makes me laugh when I drive by that new Starbucks on a Happy Valley and it's 15 cars deep you go into this phrase you have maybe a couple people ahead of you IF THAT, the kids that work here are always smiling and friendly.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Apr 15, 2023~costumer service is horrible the lady that was there seemed like she was just mad never smiled plus she didn't even greet us just had bad vibes all around I usually never leave bad reviews but when it comes to cases like this it's upsetting to have people working for Starbucks and they treat their costumers with a bad attitude...
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Aug 7, 2018~First visit to this location, the people were very nice. It was empty the evening I went, very calm and quiet in there.  I think this location may be less busy as it's sort of on the edge of town.I plan to go again.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Jan 21, 2018~This location is conveniently located inside of frys food so it makes for an easy pick up when getting groceries
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jun 23, 2015~I love my iced coffee. This location is located just inside the Frys grocery store. It's not a full Starbucks free standing location.They also cannot redeem your Starbucks rewards like a `"regular`" start bucks location can. Polite and friendly staff who are always extremely helpful.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~May 27, 2015~I love my iced coffee. This location is located just inside the Frys grocery store. It's not a full Starbucks free standing location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 4, 2017~Horrible service...super slow and the two ladies who work on Saturday mornings are horrible and don't act like even want to be there...Starbucks you need to upgrade your staff at this location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jul 2, 2017~honestly, the worst tasting coffee I've ever had.  So harsh it tasted like it had pipe scrapings in it.  Consumer Reports did blind taste tests and said it was one of the worst.  I thought that could not be right so I tried it.  I hate to say it but CR may have been right.  My experiences have been very bad.  and I don't know who is giving the cost only two stars.   This place is very pricey IMHO.   Burger King coffee tastes a lot better and so does McDonalds, IMHO.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Aug 15, 2019~This location of starbucks i will not be going to again no matter how convenient this location is. The staff is very rude, quite frankly i would much rather drive to the new drive thru location they have built next to sonic. They are not considerate of customers while gossiping in front of them. I don't care what it was about but gossiping in front of customers is very unprofessional and from a customers stand point when you are whispering and heads are turning staring at you is NOT welcoming at all. I will not be returning simply for the service that was given to me.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Feb 28, 2016~Wow!  Worst experience at Starbucks ever.  Not only did they need to remake my unsweetened black tea with no water 3 times but when Henry handed me a green tea and I informed him that I ordered a black tea and he was very rude.  I spend a lot of money at Starbucks on a daily basis and really do not appreciate Henry having an attitude &amp; being rude because he is having a bad day. Can honestly say I would drive out of my way to avoid going to this Starbucks in the future.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Nov 2, 2013~Located inside Frys Grocery Store, can be a lol hectic on Sarurdays due to families buying groceries.  However customer service is good.  All the fall drinks are in, make sure you come try it out
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Oct 27, 2017~The new ladies who work there are awful. When I walked up to the counter the two ladies were carrying on a personal conversation. I can be understanding but I stood there for about a minute and they still didn't even look at me. When they did they didn't even really say anything to me. No customer service skills at all. Not to mention it takes them over 5 minutes to make a frappe when I'm the only order that they have. So annoying to come to this Starbucks now.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Jul 23, 2015~This is a great place, unfortunately the baristas seem overwhelmed. Every time i go in there, they are so busy.. The drinks are great and just as good as other locations, but they are as lower coming out because this is a really busy location. It's on corner of 67 ave and happy valley no other Starbucks for a couple of miles around. They try really hard.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Sep 5, 2014~Not as good as it use to be. :/ In the past couple month's most of the baristas that i had come to know and enjoy talking to had left. Some said that they were leaving because management was mean and others said they were moving to bigger and better things. The new staff there is OK but just not as friendly as nice baristas i use to know. But hey they coffee is still OK.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 3, 2023~Super convenient location right off Union Hills kitty corner from Sam's Club on the cusp of Glendale x Peoria.Their parking lot is fairly cramped in this tiny strip mall. There are a lot of businesses jam packed in here. In hindsight, it would have been easier to hit their drive-thru.We were greeted immediately upon entering. There was only one other individual inside. Our drinks were made promptly and delicious.The location is incredibly clean. Their walkway and entrance is also quite clean. Decor and atmosphere are on par with most any other Starbucks location. We were thanked for stopping in and had absolutely no issues with our visit.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Sep 6, 2023~When I walked in, I was greeted by a warm and friendly barista who made me feel right at home. The customer service at this Starbucks is truly exceptional. The staff is not only efficient and professional but also incredibly personable. They chatted with me, recommended drinks, and ensured that every aspect of my visit was enjoyable.One thing that stood out to me was the attention to detail in the presentation of the drinks. Each cup is carefully crafted, and the baristas take pride in creating beautiful latte art. They are passionate about what they do.Furthermore, the cleanliness of this Starbucks is impeccable. The tables, counters, and restrooms are well-maintained, adding to the overall positive experience.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~May 28, 2023~Worst Starbucks in the entire valley. They can't get any drinks right at this location. I placed a mobile order here today and no one was even there. The app took my order &amp; my money- but no one even opened the store up. Thank you for letting me go to work with no coffee or breakfast. Bad business. I won't be back to this location.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Feb 10, 2023~I must say I love this store!! I went through the drive thru this morning per usual.  I usually see Karen who I just adore!! However today Shannon happened to be at the speaker!! YAY I have not seen her in a while.  I started talking and she said Oh my Jill how are you (NOT EVEN SEEING ME YET)!! She is just so kind and sweet and to remember my name wow after not seeing me for a while!! I just wanted to say you have some top-notch people! Huge shout out to Shannon for starting my morning off great along with Karen!!Thank you ladies you are two of a kind for sure!! Even though you were out of blueberries lol I left feeling great like always!!!Sincerely, Jill
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 23, 2022~So whatever girl is working the register today (Aug 23. 2022) at 3:33 is a freaking angel! I thought I was calling the porsche dealership asking them to update my apple car play before I got there in 20 mins and picked up my car. She thought I was talking about my Apple Card for the Starbucks app and God bless her heart she was trying her hardest to help me. Once she said I should probably call Starbucks corporate I was like omg I'm so sorry I thought this was the porsche dealership. I couldn't believe she was so patient and nice. I would have hung up on me haha. She needs a raise, promotion, and time off!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Sep 1, 2022~I've been here the last 2 days, and both times my drink was shit. I am not sure who made my first drink since I did an online order, but the second time I went into the store and it was a guy.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Nov 12, 2023~These people took like 20 minutes to make a drink and even other customers were like finally my drink is done when they actually got their drinks we pay over $20 for a couple drinks so I was expecting higher of Starbucks people they were just laughing and having a good time back there when we were waiting for our drinks wouldn't recommend.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 25, 2023~They never get my order wrong and are always nice. they ate and left no crumbs. PERIODDDD
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Nov 16, 2020~This is one slow Starbucks. We thought maybe the cars ahead of us were making complicated orders, we ended up seeing what the issue was when it was our turn to order. The guy behind the speaker just seemed rushed and confused. We had to repeat our order many times and he had to repeat it back multiple times. Other starbucks have a system where the drive through person knows what's in stock or not, not this one. When we asked if there was a certain item in stock, the employee had to say be right back multiple times to check. Its not his fault, its more of the barista in charge of the food station for not informing him whats out of stock. I was pretty aggravated as we already sat for over 20 minutes in the drive through. When we got to the window, pure chaos. We had to repeat what we ordered multiple times. In the end they ended up giving us a crushed up snowman pop that made my son upset. The inside wasn't any better. You wouldn't think there was a pandemic going on with the amount of people in there. I understand it's Saturday at 11am, but I been in Dutch lines quicker then this.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jan 25, 2022~Updated on this location. Pretty disappointed with the staff this evening. My husband went to get our drinks and ordered a drink for our little guy. Specifically asked for a tall iced oat-milk with 4 pumps of chestnut praline.. (it was a drink one of the baristas made for us in the past). She clearly didn't understand and kept insisting the iced drink  has coffee! Lol what part of `"oat milk with ice`" do you not understand and kept asking so a frap? My husband was like just make whatever that doesn't have coffee. Like why are you working here if you don't understand it wasn't very complicated. Then the guy goes and talks shit under his breath where my husband can hear that oh the regulars here get it right and the new ones don't know what they're doing? Maybe you guys shouldn't be idiots and actually listen. You work here, you should know how to take abs order.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Nov 19, 2021~Fantastic staff that was working today! They were lively friendly energetic and shout out to Nikki I believe that's her name for making my lil boy his fancy oat milk chestnut praline drink with my delicious chest nut praline iced latte! I don't always go to Starbucks but wow the service here was amazing!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Dec 28, 2022~Me and my girlypop went to this Starbucks and noticed how great of a worker Payton was! She had phenomenal customer service and was very efficient!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jun 17, 2022~I have been coming to this Starbucks while the usual one I go to gets remodeled for about 2 weeks. At my usual location, I go every morning and order a venti blonde drip coffee with half and half and classic. It's a family setting that brings me joy each time I go. I typically leave, go home and work, then come back for a refill about 90 minutes later. This has been going on for 2 years with no issue as they realize that where a person drinks their coffee doesn't matter when you're a daily customer, prioritizing loyalty and kindness over small profits. Between my wife and I we probably spend $20 a day at Starbucks. Bad habit I know. At this location however (101 and Union Hills) today, I ran into Brad, and Brad is a policy guy. A real corporate citizen, upholding the letter of the law with an iron fist. He had warned the staff that I was requesting `"Not Legit`" refills and to ask for a receipt. I was thrown off because they scan the app which has all the data about my purchases. I was told policy is that you have to remain in the store to get a refill. I looked it up, and he's right. However, this action made me go get my last coffee today and say goodbye to Brad. As I've never felt more insulted by a company in my life. My emotions walking into there store today were not joyful like the past many many years of getting to know their employees. Looks like my $20 bucks a day is about to be $0 a day because they want to charge me another $4.50 for the refill, versus .50 cents.  A short sighted policy for everyday loyal customers. If I do the math I spend about $7k at Starbucks annually, Again, and absurd habit that is about to stop and become zero a year. I hope today's decision was worth it for Brad because is about to make me $7k richer.  Way to know your customers Buddy!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 18, 2022~Went to Starbucks this morning and had the best experience with Brad! He was very efficient and really went out of his way to ensure my drink was to my liking. Brad is one of a kind!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Aug 15, 2022~I 99% of the time I come here I have absolutely no complaints, I adore all the ladies that work the 7am+ shifts They're familiar, friendly and make my drink perfect every time!Although there is one girl that each and every time I order around 5:30 in the morning ahead of time and she is thereMy drink tastes wrong, it's barely 3/4's of the way full every time she pours itBy the time I pulled away this morning ordering at 5:30 with a 5:36 pick up time and getting to the store at 5:33The photo was taken at 5:38am. I did not drink half of this drink in the 2/3 minutes I had it before realizing how empty it was with cold foam as a spacer. I didn't catch her name because I usually receive such amazing service from everyone else at this location so it's not a second thought at if my drink is full to the top or tastes right because everyone else goes above and beyond at this location . But each time she hands me my drink it's wrong or empty, it might be an early shift but any type of positive attitude from her would be appreciated. She's sullen and short with her answers and looks angry, whoever worked drive thru on Monday august 15th 2022 at 5:30 in the morning needs some serious re-training and help with her customer service skills. I paid $7.71 for this 3/4's Of the way full with an inch and a half of cold foam space. Severely disappointed in that one, specific girl.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 31, 2022~My husband went to get drinks from this Starbucks for us shortly after 4:00 pm while I was shopping nearby. He specifically asked for pineapple passionfruit and he was given the pineapple paradise drink with coconut milk. Then they gave him a very watered down strawberry açaí  drink that looked and tasted like flavored ice water. When he asked for more inclusions the barista told him they would have to charge him. I have had this same experience at this Starbucks with other drinks that looked and tasted watered down. There are several other Starbucks nearby that make the drinks the way they should be made. Don't go to this one.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Oct 26, 2018~If I could give a 0 star I would and what is most disappointing is that this used to be a really good Starbucks. I am not sure if they don't follow the recipes right or what?? But any other location I am able to enjoy my drink and be happy about it. This review honestly has nothing to do with the level of service because despite them not be able to make the drinks right they are all fairly nice. What has happened to the white mocha? Any other Starbucks I go to has amazing white mochas but this one makes them taste gross. I'm not sure what it is but it is always disappointing. This place used to be good but I don't know what they are doing different. I would suggest having management look into it because I would much rather drive down the street then to continue to get my drinks from here
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~May 8, 2022~Went to get my normal drink and was blown away by the service I received from Nikki very helpful and always on top of things. Will 100% go again
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Feb 24, 2020~Totally kicking myself for not asking for the girls name  that was working the drive through around 1030 this morning. She had to be the best Starbucks employee I have ever had. She was smiling, engaging, asked about our plans for the day and made us feel appreciated. Our drinks were made quickly and tasted great. I've been to so many Starbucks locations over the last few months and this was hands down the most memorable visit. Starbucks needs more people like her. We ordered a cold brew and white chocolate peppermint mocha. Yum
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 13, 2018~I love this location. The baristas have always been polite, fun, friendly and experienced. Service is quick and flawless. I've been to this location over 50 times and not had a drink made incorrectly which is exceptional. It's always clean and organized and I love that I can have meet ups with more than a few people and find a spot to all be together. It's located in target parking lot next to Inn and Out
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Dec 21, 2022~This is the third time I have given this Starbucks a chance. My usual order is a caramel frap . I went through the drive through and when I got my frap the whip cream had melted and I took a sip at my coffee and that was so watered down ! I check the sticker they stick on the cup and it had a time of 4:26 and I didn't get my coffee till 4:41 . I believe they had my coffee sitting there's . The drive through is always slow and the coffee is always bad . I will never come to this location again . I've givens too many chances and it's always the same problem but I've had enough . I was so disappointed this time I did park and go into the store and have my coffee remade . It still wasn't good .
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 20, 2019~I come to this Starbucks every weekday. I get a Venti white mocha all the time. Specially now that it's getting colder. But there white mochas don't taste right. I've ordered this same drink at other starbucks and it's delicious as always. But at this store it doesn't taste right. Are they making it differently than other stores. Less syrup pumps maybe. Who knows. Fix your drink.UPDATESo the manager there sent me a message months ago. I just spoke to her and she knew exactly who I was and what I was talking about. I'm updating my review to 5 stars just for that. It's amazing that they have reached out to me and figure out what's wrong so no other customers have the same experience. Feedback is a gift. And Starbucks has definitely gone above and beyond to address a customers concern. Just for the record. I have continued to visit this Starbucks everyday and will continue forever. Great Job Starbucks!

Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 13, 2021~I absolutely LOVE this location! Karen and Mary are like the ultimate duo. I frequent this location often enough, and I pulled up today and Mary was in the window and she asked about the baby and it completely melted my heart. They had a cute baby conversation, but it's truly those things that are so great. The hospitality is unmatched and she is truly a quality employee! It's been a long 15 day work `"week`"  and I was in such a terrible mood and the visit just made my entire week! Thank you Mary for being such an outstanding person
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 25, 2018~It always amazes me when I hit a Starbucks when I'm out of town. This place has really good customer service. I definitely felt welcomed when I arrived and they even upgraded me to a venti for free. Thanks guys!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jun 24, 2018~I'm just floored that I tried to buy coffee here and couldn't be helped, I go in to this location every Saturday and Sunday morning and order the same thing, 2 venti dark roast coffees with room. Now there has been times when they were low of the dark roast and I opted to wait for a new batch to be brewed. Today was that day to wait, which has never been a problem before, all I asked was if they could make sure they pour 2 fresh cups instead of one old, one new. Well, he could not say or guarantee that there new small batch could fill both cups!?!! Wtf, they don't brew more than one cup at a time??? When I said that won't work for me, he said ok! Sorry!!! Well I guess that's it for Starbucks, need some place new to give my money to
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Dec 20, 2020~Scotty is an amazing employee at this location and deserves all the raises in the world! He has such great customer service and was great at keeping a conversation! The only reason I'd come back to this location is because of him!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Feb 19, 2010~This is a Starbucks location that I used to frequent. I used to love it, but in the past year I have noticed a serious turn for the worse in their employees' attitudes. The employees here have recently been rude and snobby. It's to the point where I have stopped going simply because of that. Let's face it-- Starbucks is Starbucks. The drinks taste pretty much the same every time and at every location, so when the staff changed and started becoming unfriendly there was no longer a point to go here. I used to like this location a lot, mostly because of the friendly staff and drive-thru. (because I take my pup along with me) Now, I have switched to Coffee Bean.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Aug 26, 2019~Service was good but whoever made my drink hand a heavy hand for a drink that is supposed to be majority coffee and was asked to only have a very light/easy on the milk. My double shot on ice tasted like cold milk and was just as light in color, if not a lighter color than my fiancé's iced chai. Light milk=easy on the milk not pour a whole container. I was just really put off. I tried to go back in to ask them to remake it but I was never acknowledged so I just tossed out my drink because it was that gross...it tasted like iced milk . What a waste of money.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~May 23, 2019~This location had a friendly staff but doesn't know how to make drinks or how to communicate with their customers. My last order was a simple caramel macchiato but tasted terrible and the order was over complicated for no reason.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 13, 2022~lily was the sweetest! really knows her stuff, and gave creative and yummy suggestions
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 7, 2018~Oh Starbucks.....SMH.  This use to be one of my favorite locations.  It was on my way to work, it opened super early (4:30am), and the people were great!  Something happened and this store has new managers and staff.  The hours have changed and during the week they open at 4:30am only on Friday.  Which is fine,  I make this my Friday stop on my way into work, since it's right by the freeway.  The last few Friday's I have t seen any of the usual baristas .  This past Friday, I placed my mobile order at 4:43AM and arrived at 4:50AM.  The mobile app said the store was open, the lights were on, employees inside and the door unlocked when I arrived.  I went in and stood by the end of the counter to pick up my order.  One employee stocking the front called out `"we have someone at the counter`".   He walked out and asked if I placed a  mobile order (looking down at the ticket)`".  I said `"yes`".  The next employee rushes out (Jade) and said I needed to leave because the store isn't open until 5AM and hat the safe is open and unlocked.  First, should you really be telling customers that you have an unlocked open safe....?  I said @you probably shouldn't be telling people that and maybe if that is the case, you should lock your door`".  I explained that I placed my mobile order and it says that this location is OPEN!.  She again told me to leave, take my phone with my mobile order and find an open Starbucks store and three will make what I ordered.  The guy behind the counter said he would make my coffee since I was here - this is the only good service I had at the location.  I told the girl Jade he was making my order and she became more upset and again said I needed to leave.  She continues to go on about how the entire store staff is new, the manager Katelyn is new and how the manager makes mistakes all the time with the schedule and the do NOT EVER OPEN AT 5AM on FRIDAYS.  Again, odd to me since I've been here at 4:45AM picking up my mobile orders on Fridays.She even went to the back, brought out a schedule and waved it in my face.  During all of this, two other customers also placed mobile orders and walked in to pick their orders up.  I told this girl I was going to contact corporate because he service and representation of the Starbucks brand is being slaughtered by her! I did, I wrote up a little messages about what happened and even said they should look at the video due to how she acted.  Starbucks corporate responded in a very respectful manner.  Overall I can say I will NEVER go to this location EVER again and shame on whoever hired that girl Jade.  Considering all of the bad publicity Starbucks has recently had due to how the employees treat customers - what a shame.  Wherever the previous staff at this location went...your missed.  Those were friendly people, friendly faces and knew customer service.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 28, 2018~This is a great location with friendly staff and fast service. I love how I can go here and get free puppuccinos for my dogs.  Thank you for the excellent continued service. I will definitely be returning.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Oct 4, 2019~First and foremost, let me begin withour barista/drive through lady was beyond rude. When we asked for regular sugar, she then asked which kind. We said the non diet regular one. She gives us Splenda, I then politely asked her if we can have the regular one. She then raised her tone and asked `"I don't know what you mean by regular sugar, for me regular sugar means Splenda`" I said the white package please. She then gives us the sugar and we drive away. Come on lady!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Apr 21, 2018~Never had a problem here. Drinks are always served exactly as ordered. The only issue I do have is that the drive thru is nestled in a funky area and the parking lot can be nuts.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~May 16, 2018~Yikes. I'm a Starbucks lover, but this location needs some help. I waited as employees had a good chat before waiting on me. I made my usual order and was charged for green tea in my refresher. I order this drink often and am never charged for the tea. When I asked, the barista shrugged and said he thinks he is supposed to charge. Duh. Find out!The store also needed a good scrubbing.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 30, 2021~It almost seems like they just pick and choose everyday what hours they want to be open. It certainly doesn't follow the hours listed on their site or even on their door. They randomly don't open until after 8am some mornings, close early other days. In store pickups are sporadic. They shut down ordering on the app all the time bc they can't handle the volume. I don't know who thought this owner was worthy of a franchise.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Sep 19, 2020~Woah!! It's 8 a.m. and I am sitting outside of Starbucks reading a book and enjoying a cup of coffee... I'd just like to say - great playlist!! It's Latino music... first ROSALÍA and now Colombian music?! This is a good change to the usual cafe music...Keep it up Starbucks!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Feb 10, 2018~This Starbucks sucks compared to others.  I order no foam and I get foam.  Order light ice and you get heavy ice.  Maybe I should be opposite George.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Nov 6, 2018~I've never had a challenge with customer service as Starbucks but for some reason every time I come to this location they try to tell me a better* way to order my drink when I know exactly how I would like my* drink. `"In my opinion`" Maria (I believe. Dark curly hair with lipstick on) should keep her rude, snarky opinions to herself. When I told her I like it the way I order it she got upset, snapped at one of the baristas and then snatched the drink from them to do it herself. These days customer service is everything guys, get it right. Don't try and tell your customers what they want.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jun 27, 2018~Great service and friendly staff both inside and at the drive thru. My only complaint is it has a longer drive thru wait is longer than other Starbucks. However, it's convenient location definitely keeps me coming back, just not at busy times.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Dec 28, 2020~Every time I've been to this drive thru the line has been short and the customer service has been amazing. The workers are extremely nice and want to go out of their way to make sure you got everything you need. 10/10 would recommend going to this location.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Dec 23, 2021~i literally just went for my daily Starbucks and Nikki was so amazing  she was the sweetest and made my day  the best barista i've ever had!!! 1000/10 recommend going to see her
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jul 30, 2017~I ordered an iced drink from the drive-thru, and when I picked it up after I got home the lid popped off and coffee got all over the inside of my car! :(  From what I understand, this isn't necessarily the barista's fault - but still, learn from my loss and be *careful* when handling drinks from this location!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 26, 2021~I get the same drink . Every time . This Month I have been charged 9 different amounts . 545 the first 4 times . 612 the next 2 . 7 dollars 2 times and 721 today . Every time I say something I get told I'm not being charged correctly. Today I was told . I don't know what to tell you . Then asked if I wanted a manager. Like I'm totally willing to understand an explanation and I've said that . Every time I question it I am met with an obstinate remark . I have my receipts and I can see where there are different amounts but the receipt says the same thing . And this is over the course of just January. 9 amounts. Same product. I really believe that this store employees are skimming . Which could be felonious. So my ask is this if you get the same product every time you go look how the price changes . It may only be 1 -2 dollars but if you time that by let's says 200 customers a day that's 200-400 dollars a day 1400- 2800 dollars a week 71200- 142200 dollars a year . It's at that point felonious.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jun 8, 2019~Bad service at the drive trough! Sitting over 10 minutes in the line defeat the purpose of the drive trough !
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Mar 18, 2012~The baristas here are great.  I have to say, some mornings, I come in pretty grouchy because I haven't had my caffeine fix yet.  They always cheer me up.  This location has a drive through, but the line gets pretty long.  It's very convenient to the freeway so it's pretty busy most mornings.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 15, 2014~Starbucks supports planned parenthood. I am pro-life and will only support businesses that are pro-life, like Lifeboat Coffee at www.lifeboatcoffee.com. When you make a purchase at Lifeboat Coffee, $1.00 is donated to a pro-life organization! No more will i go to a Starbucks or buy their brand at a grocery store.In addition, the last time I was there, I got a caramel mocha. When I got on the freeway to take my first sip all it was was hot milk! Terrible, terrible ,terrible! I needed my caffeine! And let's not forget the slow service!!!!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jan 7, 2014~I just don't know anymore! They used to be good but the last time I stopped there in the drive thru, besides a 20 minute wait, to my surprise after getting back on the freeway that my caramel mocha turned out to be hot milk only!!! Dutch Brothers off of the 101 &amp; Thunderbird IS THE place for fast &amp; friendly service always with your correct order!!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 15, 2015~As a partner, I love going into other stores to be on the other side of the counter! The ladies working we're welcoming and greeted me promptly. The shift on duty rang us up (didn't catch her name but she had a cross necklace on and tattoo on he arm), and made lovely conversation. The barista (Samantha) made my iced Americano to perfection, which honestly most don't make them correctly!The store was clean and stocked and they were fast.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jan 23, 2018~I go to this Starbucks almost every day.  The people here are absolutely amazing.  They all know me by name and, though always busy, take the time to say hello with a genuine (not robotic) greeting.  The manager is always in a great mood and it shows in the people working there.  I have a pretty difficult drink, and they don't always get it right, but when they get it wrong they always fix it with a smile.  I've seen a few managers come in and out of this location, and whatever the current one is doing has been exemplary.  As a retail manager, I know good customer service when I see it, and this Starbucks goes above and beyond expectations.  Well done guys!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jan 16, 2018~Very friendly staff. Quick with orders. Drink always tastes great. Love its close to work for an early morning indulgence and friendly face.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Sep 5, 2014~I am beginning to really dislike this drive thru location.  3rd time they can't seem to get a drink order right. I asked for a kids milk light ice, &amp; we have our cup for her. As well as an iced coffee with splash of milk. Again they gave her chocolate milk/heavy ice. Ugh
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 16, 2018~I come here EVERY morning for the same drink. One day I pay $4.09 the next day it's $4.57 then sometimes like today it's $5.12 and so on. I don't understand how or why the price of the SAME DRINK changes everyday it gets expensive as it is and when they pick and choose what to charge it's usually more. Then when they even mess up the amount of pumps in my drink and it's more then the day before?! It's getting really annoying when I go everyday and it's a different price. WTF Starbucks.... and if I'm lucky I'll get my drink made right here at this location. I feel like they have new staff in the morning and they suck. Period.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jan 5, 2014~This place is busy!!!  Drive thur and walk in.  Friendly staff!  The wait was not too long.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 13, 2017~I visit a lot of different Starbucks (and Tim Horton's) and the team at this Starbucks was the friendliest I've ever come across. I've only been here a few times (on vacations), but it's been a great experience both times. And there's a drive-thu, so, you know... bonus.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 26, 2010~I was quite surprised with the previous reviews on rudeness, especially when i come from a city where rudeness is part of the everyday norm.  Our drive thru gal was very polite and sweet, without being overly sacchrine-y or fake.  Servie was quick and they were patient AND polite when naming and explaning all the breakfast sandwiches to companion who had never had one. Drinks great, not watered down.  Would come back in a heartbeat
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 20, 2017~The dude was supper nice and quick thank you they were out of the unicorn at 4:30am but that was a bummer his attitude made up for it so thank you and he went the extra step to give me the # to another supper dope thank you meng Thursday morning @4:40am working drive threw thank you
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Sep 15, 2017~While I like how quiet this Starbucks typically is, sometimes it's way too cold. I know it's Phoenix and it's hot outside, but do I need to bring a jacket to drink my coffee?
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Dec 27, 2018~Ordered 2 drinks, sweetened iced coffee with cream and a Carmel Macchiato iced. (My go to drink @ Starbucks). Coffee tasted burnt/old and my drink did not taste sweet or like Carmel at all, was placed in window with Carmel drizzle on the outside of the cup, and the iced coffee tasted also burnt and not sweet at all.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 18, 2015~This Starbucks location is amazing and always gets stuff done fast and quick. If you are looking for great service, this is the place! I come here often and the people that work here are the nicest people I have ever met! Best in the area by far!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 5, 2019~Above and beyond service this morning--I had a blonde moment and mobile ordered at the wrong location; the fellow behind the counter did not judge, was so kind and whipped up my order right in front of me and told me to have a great day. An error I'll certainly learn from, but I thank you for the exceptional customer service. Hard to come by!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 26, 2017~Friendliest Starbucks crew as a collective whole. Nice work!!! Definitely would make you want to come inside instead of the drive-through
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Oct 3, 2018~They suck.. they always have a 10 min wait and only two people in the drive thru also they're rude as hell.. today I ordered and got an attitude a sigh and a `"WHAT ELSE`"... usually they take forever but they're nice today was a no for me...
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Apr 24, 2017~Drove up to the drive thru at 5:36 am and waited until 5:40 and no one answered. Drove up to the window and nothing. Waited there and even honked my horn. Nothing. Drove to the front and saw an employee there and asked if they weren't open or something. He said no there were and apologized. But at that time it was 5:46 and I had to get to work without coffee
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Oct 16, 2015~TERRIBLE service. We failed to get a receipt so we don't know any names, but whatever barista was working the window 10/16/15 at noon needs to be fired. She completely disregarded the fact that she didn't snap the lid on my husbands frappacino and half of it spilled all over our white interior. We understand mistakes happen but she did not even apologize and rolled her eyes when my husband asked for napkins. Then rolled her eyes again when we asked for more whip cream since it was all in our lap. I have never seen such crumby service at a Starbucks before.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Mar 28, 2016~Writing this review for students looking for a place to study. It's a small Starbucks but really good size tables and outlets, I thought I hit jack pot when I found this hidden Starbucks since it was so empty compared to the one on 83rd and bell however I realized the reason why. They crank the AC to -30 degrees. I'm the type to like my place cold too but how they do it is literally painful and I come dressed prepared to be in the cold. While studying here I've seen people go outside to wait for their drinks cause it was so cold inside. They do take a while to make drinks and you get a hit or miss with the baristas, I've met one that knew my name and drink after one visit and others that were absolutely awful. Parking is very limited I've had to park on the other end of the lot but the drive through always seems empty and quick.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 18, 2019~The worst Starbucks. Been here multiple times, never had a good experience! I agree with what all of the other reviews said... sometimes me drink tastes like it is made of old or expired product. They're never consistent. Even when I ordered a venti mocha Frappuccino, they gave me some other chocolate Frappuccino and said `"oh trust me, you'll like the Frappuccino's much better this way!`" Horrible customer service. Don't go here.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jan 30, 2015~This location has been amazing in helping me perfect my drink of choice! The manager actually cares if you like the drink served and when we brought back our drink she didn't just hand us a `"free drink`" card she gave us suggestions, made the drink and even walked out to my car to see if my wife (who was in the car with our kids) liked it!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jan 9, 2013~This is Starbucks and you know what to expect!  Consistent as all the rest of the locations and good coffee.  What makes this location stand out is that it's the only drive thru location in the Arrowhead area.  It's nice to not have to get out of the car once in a while in Suburbia!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Dec 8, 2013~This place has an awesome drive thru. Not a bad location either right off the 101 freeway and union hills. Again the drive thru service was fast and the people who work there know how to get things done I had my coffee in my within like 1 minute. To be honest that's not bad considering that I was the third car back, keep up the good work Starbucks crew!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Oct 11, 2015~I don't understand. They closed this Starbucks for all of these renovations which were not needed and now they do not use the camera so u can see them when you order. I mean they can see you and u can see them but they never turn it on. What is the sense to spend all of that money to install a system such as this and it is never utilized? They could've taken that money and gave it to a poor community or pay their workers more or lower the price of their expensive coffee. All I am saying is that if you are going to spend the money use what you spent it on!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 11, 2014~The lady that took my order through the drive thru was AMAZING! It's almost 6am and she was cheerful without being fake and super polite. I wish I lived closer to this location because that was some of the best service I've had at a Starbucks!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Mar 31, 2016~Ordered a venti nonfat caramel frappuccino and they Made a grande instead of venti.  I think to fix it they just threw it back in the blender with more milk and ice.  It's almost white and doesn't have much flavor.  Also asked for extra caramel drizzle and there is barely any.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Apr 11, 2014~Slowest drive thru ever!!!!! Mcdonalds is faster then this. Please hire better and faster people. This is ridiculous.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 19, 2015~By far my favorite Starbucks! I have another location closer to my house but go out of my way each &amp; every time for this one because of one thing-the customer service. They never fall short of absolute kindness (even at 5 AM). They also never have me feeling rushed to make a decision on what I want. The drive through gets crazy long in the mornings considering its right next to the freeway but the staff is quick to get everyone through the line. I am always greeted with a friendly smile and that's the exact reason I continue to come back to this one. Keep up the great work Starbucks staff!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~May 24, 2013~Terrific location, staff was legit. Small selection of retail. Fast service. Packed lobby. You can see the ocean out front. They have a good selection of  treats if you get there in the am. If you are a partner this is a real bucks so you can get you deal on.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Aug 4, 2012~I was visiting some relative in the area and stopped at this Starbucks.  I visit a lot of Starbucks and this store seems poorly managed.  The wait was 20 minutes for our  simple order after we paid.  The staff were more concerned about drive thru customers who paid after us than our order.  There were no tables inside so we went to sit outside.  As we were sitting outside the manager INTENTIONALLY shut off the misters when it was 110 degrees.  He claimed they stopped working. But they mysteriously shut off after our neighboring table complained about the poor service.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jul 2, 2013~Am always amazed at how different each Starbucks is in terms of service. Today I was here to redeem my `"coffee bag`" free cup. I asked to upgrade to an americano as I cannot drink the Pikes because of the acidity.   The girl ( in the drive-through) said she couldnt do that. I explained why I couldnt drink the Pikes and that I had done this before at a Starbucks with no issue but she still said no.   The store at 75th and Bell has an awesome crew and I continually go back there unless I am in a different area of town.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Sep 26, 2015~This starbs is a 'hit or miss'.  Sometimes service and quality is awesome... Others it feels worse than McDonalds.  Double check your drink... Or better yet go to the starbs on lake pleasant parkway!!!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Feb 1, 2014~I went through the long drive through to discover amazing service!  The voice through the speaker was such a refreshing delight to hear. He was so happy and talkative, very polite and brought a smile to my face!  Just how it should be when you drive away with your starbucks treat in hand! I'm ready to take on the day thanks to my new favorite location!  Nad the flan latte is all its said to be and more!  Love it!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Nov 21, 2012~I travel for work many times a year and I also have Starbucks and  or Dunkin Donuts on a daily basis. I was there at the end of August and that Manager was ignorant to an elderly couple that was seating outside in 115 degree weather and turned off the mister when the couple asked to keep it on. His answer was that HE'S IN CHARGE and can have it turned off at any time!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! I really thought I was on that `"What would you do Show?`" I will never spend my money no longer at this location and called Corporate to report this Manager.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jun 3, 2017~This is my least favorite Starbucks location which is unfortunate because it's the most convenient one for me to go to. My order is made correctly maybe 50% of the time so my advice to you is to always check and taste your drink before you leave the drive-thru! I'm not one of those people that orders a complicated drink either... one time I ordered an iced vanilla coffee and when I got on the road and tasted it they put sugar free vanilla in it (I hate the taste of fake sugar) today I decided to go to this location because it was on my way and they failed to deliver what I ordered once again. My coffee was good but I ordered a sprouted grain bagel and they gave me an everything bagel .... I'm mad at myself for not checking until I got home. It said the right order on the bag but it was the wrong bagel inside. The employees are friendly and they work fast through the long line of the drive-thru which I appreciate but I would rather wait a few extra minutes and get the right order. I understand mistakes happen and that's why I didn't write a review right away. I wanted to give this location the benefit of the doubt but now that I've gone over a dozen times and only half the time they get the order right, this seems to be too common of an occurrence at this location.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~May 18, 2013~I use this starbucks frequently because its close to where I work. Over time I have experienced coffee served cold, orders completely wrong, extremely slow and unenthusiastic service. This is so common I expect it now. In fact when they get it right im actually surprised. Ive contacted their management on a few really bad occasions and receive the same apathy. I suggest only going there if you have to because, afterall, it is a very convenient location.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jul 23, 2016~thanks to the mobile order my drink is made correctly now. downfall is that its never ready until i go in and ask. its usually a 7-10 minute drive to the Starbucks so i feel it's more than enough time
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jul 22, 2015~Update* if you ask for classic syrup + another syrup with it, and the classic is not on your sticker, then it's not in your cup.regardless. If they say classic is  automatically in there, it's not. Always double check-especially if you're in drive thru and don't want to leave with bitter coffee.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Aug 8, 2014~My friend asked if i wanted anything while she was in drive thru- as she was on the phone with me-- She ordered my drink correctly and instead of my 3 pumps classic and 1 punp white mocha she came home with 3 pumps white mocha and 3 pumps mocha. Wtf! THANK GOD ONE ON BELL OPENED UP!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jun 26, 2014~Hit or miss with the drinks... 3/4 of the time they forget to add my classic syrup and only add the one pump of white mocha that i ask for... i leave with bitter tasting coffee only convenience is that its a drive-thru and there's not many around the area
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 28, 2013~Drive thru was fast and they provided excellent service.....  And let me tell you, I needed my Starbucks Coffee right away.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Nov 14, 2014~I've been going to this location for over 2 years now.  I wouldn't go to Starbucks as often if it wasn't for this branch's convenient location on my way to work. Now I'm too uncomfortable to go back there.  I spend a lot of money here and I am a gold member.  Recently my account suddenly stopped accumulating rewards. My account showed transactions but not the stars. I was on the phone (for over 30 min) to get this fixed on Monday. The girl in the drive- through was super friendly and even gave me my coffer for free when she heard about my card issues. The customer service representative with Starbucks said that my card has  been registered all along and that he fixed all the problems on the card and added my stars for the transactions that hadn't accumulated them. After that phone call I received an email saying that I earned my free drink. So I was excited and the next day I went to get my free drink. I showed the girl in the drive-through my phone which said that I earned my free drink. She told me my card is not registered....she asked me if I wanted to pay for my drink with my gold card.  I showed her all the proof that I earned the free drink again. And this point the friendly girl from Monday came up and told me that I can't keep doing this and that I really need to call to get this resolved!!! After I've been on the phone for ever, was told that it was fixed!! I didn't know what to say. This was Starbucks' fault,  not mine but she made me feel like I'm just trying to squeeze a free drink out of them.  I tried to explain the situation and she shrug her shoulders, rolled her eyes and wouldn't even look at me. O even bougjt a drink on my card for the person in line behind me, so it's not like I just didn't spend any money that day.  I drove off so angry that I was almost in tears!! I called customer service back and had a really nice lady help me. She said my card IS registered and that the only thing she can think of is that the card itself is faulty. She cancelled the card and sent me a new one. She really handled things and made me feel better.  However,  I'm uncomfortable now going back to that location, with these girls thinking I'm a freeloader.  Today,  Friday is usually my Starbucks day. I made my own coffee at work instead. I'm torn now. Starbucks may  have to be an occasional thing again when I happen to pass one on a road trip. I can't get myself to go back to that location and there is no other convenient one on my way to work. I'm really disappointed.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Nov 30, 2016~I'm here a lot and I have not once had a bad experience. Sometimes the drive thru can get a little backed up and the parking lot isn't the greatest, but the employees are really friendly and give great recommendations and have never messed up my drinks. They are great! If the drive thru looks busy, it usually moves rather quickly under the circumstances
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Oct 14, 2016~15 minutes til 10pm on a Friday night.  2 ppl inside cleaning up BUT front door LICKED UP EARLY!!! Not cool.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Oct 10, 2016~This location is in need of some serious cleaning. All the trash cans were overflowing, the windows were filthy and the counters seriously needed wiped down. The staff wasn't welcoming either. It's a drive thru so I guess those customers are their top priority and since they can't see the inside, it doesn't matter. Not impressed.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Dec 31, 2015~This SBUX is worst I've ever been to. So slow. Just yesterday I was the only one in the store and waited a full minute at the register before anyone acknowledged me. How does that happen at sbux?!? Most stores I can't get them to stop being nice to me. Not sure why I keep coming here, I get more mad every time.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Sep 20, 2014~Drive through is much more popular than walk in. Makes for perfect study location. I come here just for this purpose. Drinks are ... Starbucks quality, nothing new
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~May 10, 2015~My wife and I are in our 80's and don't get out much. On Mothers Day my wife was given different gift baskets by my sons and daughter-in-laws. One basket had a small vile of Starbuck's caramel brule chocolate bites. My wife after everyone left opened the vile and really was impressed with the taste. She stated tomorrow she wanted to go to Starbuck's and buy several. I called Starbucks later and the girl said she carried these in the store and if I wanted to come be now, she would package five (5) for me.  She was very helpful and went out of her way to make sure the product was their and waiting to be picked up. We both appreciate her attitude and attention to our requests. Excellent customer service.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Aug 22, 2010~Used to like coming to this one.  After today, I would rather drive to one 50 miles away where atleast they smile and don't make fun of customers orders when ordering though the drive thru.  It's just rude and tacky!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jun 9, 2013~Courteous staff and it's Starbucks.  Their coffee speaks for itself.  I love the drive thru makes my morning coffee run on the way to work that much better.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Apr 5, 2024~Clean, easy to find. Coffee was a little too hot but I also had to ask for my order. App said it was ready but when I got there it wasn't there. Others who were with me and ordered after me got their beverage first. Not sure why they had they made my drink but the app said it would be ready.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Sep 5, 2024~Great crew, consistent, always friendly upon coming into the store! My go to every morning
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Aug 31, 2023~Maddie and Nyeem and the rest of the group at this wonderful Starbucks just made for my beautiful man's and my day. Your friendly and openness made for a wonderful and refreshing afternoon on this hot August afternoon. Thank you again for making our drinks so correct and fast.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Jun 30, 2021~SB with a drive thru. The inside is small with no nice, cushiony chairs. A couple employees were sitting in the customer area being really loud and making inappropriate noises.A below avg. Bucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jun 11, 2023~Destinee was awesome really made me feel welcome went above and beyond and so quickly
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 30, 2024~this starbucks closes at 8pm, i showed up once at 7:50 they were closed, understandable. i showed up at 7pm and they are closed. they also are very slow during the day. two people in line, and it takes 15 min for me to get my coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Nov 3, 2023~I usually have okay experience at this location as some of the ladies are not friendly at all and seem upset when they watch you click no tip on their little machine after handing you a half frozen sandwich. Choose a different location to greet you in the morning as they will start you with a not good morning
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Oct 5, 2023~I order here 5 days a week before my work shift in the morning and sometimes at my lunch break and I LOVE IT! The staff is so sweet and they never miss the mark. My drinks are always tasty and the grilled cheese I get is always tasty and warm. Today I got a note written on the top of my lid that said `"You're doing great`" and I didn't see it until I left but when I did, it made my day. Definitely the best Starbucks out of all the locations I've been to.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Aug 20, 2022~Seriously the best customer service!!!!  And thedrinks were delicious I totally totally recommend this location!!  The beautiful lady at the drive-through window truly made my day !!! Keep up the great work!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Sep 8, 2021~Days open till 8pm and it's 6:51pm. Please update your online hours as they don't match or reflect correctly.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Dec 15, 2022~The worst service I've ever experienced. Had a mobile order went in to pick it up. Waited for a few  minutes until someone finally recognized me. Asked me my name for the order and gave me my order. Took a sip and there was way too much milk. I asked the lady if she can just throw another shot in. She responded with `"do you just want grande cup?`" I said well sure but... then she just cut me off  and said `" next time just put the cup size`" and dumped half my coffee out of my venti cup and started to make other online orders before finishing mine.... I wasn't rude or mean about asking. I'm in the service industry and the whole act she threw was totally unprofessional. I just moved into the neighborhood and would love for this place to be where I get my coffee but after today. I wont come back. Also my new coffee taste like shit still
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Nov 8, 2023~wow. wow. wow. absolutely amazed by the service here. the ladies were super friendly especially Angela. She made my entire experience and I will only be going to this location from now on!!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Feb 14, 2021~Need some coffee quick-style??? This drive-through Starbucks knows how to clear a queue super quick. Service is always friendly an efficient , and the drinks and food are always good quality and well-made. Even the ambience in-store is just right for a pit-stop while you watch the traffic buzzing past. Thumbs-up from me.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Aug 25, 2022~I love this location. It's not that busy. I never use the drive thru, but even the drive thru isn't that busy from what I can see. Does Starbucks always have what you need? Do they always get an order right? Is the coffee always great? Are the workers always in a great mood? No, but this location is so consistent in MY very inconsistent day and that's all I need.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jun 17, 2021~This place is super sanitary without asking Cameron sanitized My beautiful star bucks cup so worth buying it and I feel safe to eat here constantly have hygiene materials together
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Dec 21, 2017~I frequent this location for the drive-thru in the mornings, and I have to say that they have one of the fastest Starbucks drive-thrus in the Valley. On my way to work during rush hour, the line is always long, but it usually goes by quickly. Customer service is efficient and the weekday morning shift really has the flow down.I've also sat inside to do some work on my laptop. It's decently clean and there are plenty of outlets for your electronics. I do wish that they were open later at night.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Nov 12, 2020~Elaine is AMAZING! Talk about amazing costumer service, especially when you accidentally order a drink incorrectly and they fix it super nicely  100% amazing trip to Starbucks after ordering 16 drinks!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Oct 18, 2022~They messed up my drinks, mind you they were super busy. Told them I didn't want those and the girl at the window was really cool about the whole situation  Gave me my right order and the drinks were amazing!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Sep 17, 2021~I cannot say enough good things about this location. They ALWAYS get my order right, quickest Starbucks for MILES even when the are packed, and the sweetest professional staff. Other Starbucks are slow to the point I turn my car off in line, and my drink never tastes quite right. This is the only Starbucks I will be going to! They are also amazing to watch the staff work as a team. My only complaint is they put too much ice in their drinks but I would take too much ice over slow staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 15, 2022~THE WORST STARBUCKS EVER! no wonder the employees are organizing a union. the manager is so lazy and never there, overworks the employees and is very disorganized and disrespectful. older white lady that works there is super slow and doesn't know how to make drinks. starbucks is very much going down hill and no one is doing anything after a $9 drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jun 21, 2022~worse starbucks ever. management, specifically cassidy, is the most irresponsible manager ever. always late, rude, and disorganized. disrespectful management overall. good luck if you ever work or come eat here.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Feb 14, 2021~I came in today and was instantly greeted-always nice:)-and I asked about how long it might take for a caramel macchiato as I didn't want to be late to work. Even though they had a line in the drive through, they sensed my urgency and made it right away! It's the little things in life like this during a pandemic that keeps me coming back to Starbucks. Thanks again guys! You made my day:D
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~May 8, 2020~The only reason this store gets 1 star, two reasons. Cannot go any lower and the girl apologized for being rude, arrogant and disrespectful. I was not going to write this, however, the Manager never called me back and she has had plenty of time to do so, either the message was not provided, or the manager does not care about her store. I stop by to get a tea. The sign reads, `"Mobile orders pick up inside`". I had a Mobil order called the store first and to no surprise, nobody answered. I walked into the store and the girl comes out from the side and tells me to leave. I told her I was picking up an order and she forcefully said to leave and pushing me out of the store. Embarrassing, 100%!!!! The line in the drive thru was full and windows down. She said I can wait and they will bring the drink out. When she brought the drink out, I showed her the sign. She said that she will change the sight and next time ring the bell (didn't even see the, or a sign indicating to push for your drink). I told her I there would not be a next time because she was rude. She smelled and said have a good day. Worse experience in customer service I have seen. You know nothing will happen cause people want their coffee. However, next is the corporate office. I called to talk to the manager and low and behold I talked to the same person. She back tracked her attitude and took full responsibility for being such a jerk (not the word I would choose, however, keeping it clean). She said she will have her boss call in 24 hours that was over 36 hours ago. Didn't really expect one, I did say I would hold off on a review and calling corporate until she can call me back. I kept my word, too bad you did not!!!Careful fellow coffee drinkers, I would go to the one on 7th street 2 miles down the road and skip the attitude from this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Nov 28, 2015~This Starbucks is losing it. I don't go there that often but, as Jenny and I were waiting (and waiting....and waiting) in the drive thru last weekend, I asked her if she'd noticed it seemed to have gotten worse and she agreed. We recanted our recent experiences at this location -- long waits and incorrect orders mostly (which is about all Starbucks is) -- while we waited. Then, when our drinks came and we pulled away, lo and behold, our orders were wrong.Filter the reviews by date and you can see the same trend with the latest reviews. I don't know how this one got so off the mark but, man, it's just a head scratcher.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~May 8, 2021~The people working here are rude, won't acknowledge you standing waiting for a mobile order, have zero sense of customer service, and make me hate Starbucks as a whole. One of the worst locations!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jul 7, 2020~Shoutout to the drive thru employee working right now! She is AWESOME - middle name `"Alexis`"! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Dec 18, 2017~Super nice manager Felicia!!When they accidentally made me a mocha instead of a white mocha, Felicia and another manager gave me a gift card.  Such a sweet customer service touch!!This drive thru is fast and the overall shop is tidy.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Aug 5, 2019~Tried 3 different teas. All were terrible. Customer service is always good. Coffee to strong for me.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jun 25, 2020~Always quick and efficient. Love your refreshers! Always smiling faces in there and appreciate your support of local issues!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~May 31, 2020~Gage was very friendly and welcoming! Amazing and authentic service. Thank you for going above and beyond at this Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Nov 19, 2019~This Starbucks is certainly lovely and the barista made a our drinks to perfection and very quickly considering we ordered ahead for pick up. One disadvantage of this location is the small parking area and inconveniently places drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Feb 24, 2017~This is the best starbucks in town! Everyone is super friendly and are very quick to make sure your order is out in a timely manner. This starbucks is out of my way but it is well worth the drive. Bree has to be the best batista in town. She always greets customers with a smile and treats everyone like a friend. I can't recommend this starbucks more!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Oct 3, 2021~How do you not add nutmeg to the top of the pumpkin cream cold brew? It is essential!!! One star..
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Dec 12, 2013~GRAND OPENINGGGGGGGGThis Starbucks is not your ordinary Starbucks. This place is so big. I love the patio. The wooden table with the stools is so cute. I love the staff.  Everyone is so friendly. I am going to go broke with this place, its on my way to work, its a drive thru, it's just perfect.ahhhhhh
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Dec 6, 2019~This Starbucks was so welcoming this morning! I walked in and they all yelled good morning, it honestly lifted my mood. Nothing like great customer service, especially at 8 am when everyone is tired!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Apr 20, 2019~They don't follow their business hours! I was aware the new business hours are 7:30 on Saturday here but I showed up at 7:10 for a refresher not even coffee and they were closed  might as well close at 7 if you wanna start your weekend earlier
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Oct 10, 2010~I usually don't like to review Starbucks because there's too many of them, but the baristas here are very nice and they deserve to be acknowledged. This Starbucks location gets a `"fan`" rating not because of the coffee, but the great speedy service even when they are busy.Now as far as the coffee goes, I don't really care for it because I think it's too strong, but their Chai Lattes are awesome.I usually come here before I drop off my clothes at Regal Cleaners. It's right across the street from it.I've always had good service here and with free wi-fi, how could you not love it? Overall, always a great experience. Props to this Starbucks for knowing how to handle their flow!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Mar 6, 2013~I love this Starbucks!  the Staff is super nice when i walk in they greet you, and they seem up-beat and really chummy ^^ but I deff- will continue to come back and enjoy the atmosphere :)
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Nov 21, 2017~This Starbucks is one of the Valley's best. I've been to many many Starbucks in the Valley, buck Zach, Zach and the Amazing staff here on Missouri and 7th Ave are knowledgeable, courteous, and kind. Great place to stop off and enjoy a tasty hot or cold beverage.  Smiles.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Sep 1, 2018~Accidentally handed the cashier a $50 instead of a $20. She gives me 8 five dollar bills in change. I ask if I could change them to 2 twenties. She had to check with her manager. She comes back one minute later and tells me it can't be done. It seems to me that the manager was just too lazy to get up and come open the register for me. PATHETIC SERVICE!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jun 11, 2022~I read a few other unhappy reviews and have to echo them.  It is so often bad we have to believe the mismanagement there lives up to its connotation.  We are not even talking the hours when the other Starbucks in the area are backed up around the block. I had seen this Starbucks had shorter lines, but unfortunately the reason was rhe service was amazingly bad.  Incorrect drink doesn't begin to explain this situation.  My last Venti, Carmel Frappuccino, light, no whip, which was purchased by a friend was prime example.  From what I can surmise, whip was still added.  They emptied out a third of my order trying to remove whip, finally resorting to scooping 2/3's of it out but not replacing the coffee.  In the midst of these problems the use of the blender to mix the drink was neglected.  My drink came with a flat slice ice almost as tall as the drink itself, along with a couple of regular looking cubes of ice.  Tried calling to speak with management, but after awhile decided they were at least smart enough to avoid answering the phone and dealing with the complaints.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Mar 19, 2022~This Starbucks get worse each time we try and give them another chance since we live in the area. Just this morning, myself and 4 other customers all had their orders made incorrectly. The young man making drinks got an attitude with the lady before me because it was the second time HE made her drink wrong. Second time! The younger staff were more interested in talking about the young man's friend who got locked out her house from being too wasted the night before. When I finally received my order, we had 1 incorrect drink, 1 completely wrong drink and the middle of the sausage sandwich was still frozen. The same young man again was irritated I asked him to correct the drink mistakes. There didn't seem to be a manger on duty as another frustrated customer requested to speak to one. This location really needs to get it together. This is too prime of a location for such a lack of customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Jul 20, 2018~It seems like my drink is always a different price when I come here! Yesterday I got a venti and it was cheaper then the grande exact same drink today! They have messed up multiple drinks of mine, including using milk instead of a milk alternative (I can't have milk/milk products) sometime the employees are super friendly and sometimes they are super rude! If I am paying depending on what I order $4-8 for a drink I would like it to be right and the same price each time I come in.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Sep 17, 2016~This is one of the slowest Starbucks I've ever been to. I'm going on 5 minutes waiting for a cup of ice. Apparently that also has to be made in order of all the drinks. Cashier looks hungover and the only time she's smiling is when she's talking to the other baristas. As soon as a customer walks up she looks like she just rolled out of bed. There's 5 baristas back there. You would think things would be moving a little faster. Going on 7 minutes now.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Mar 31, 2018~Love Love Starbucks,however was a bit upset when I ordered the limited time only frappe `"the Crystal Ball.`"On the Starbucks website Starbucks claims you will get `" 1 of 3 candy gems that tell u ur future???`" My friend and I drank half of the frappe making sure we weren't eating anything such as a jem? But when we got home we dumped out our frappes to see if we could really find the jems, to our disappointment me and my best friend both didn't have one gem in ours??? Very Disappointed! We both got frappes?
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Oct 14, 2020~Cole at the drive through was amazing. So was the management staff. Highly impressed and recommend this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Dec 20, 2008~I just had to up this Starbucks one more star because the surly dude who works there isn't half as bad as I previously described him.  He is just who he is... a little curt, but also kind of funny in a Joe Pesci-kind-of-way. And, I am thrilled to say that I L-O-V-E their seasonal Carmel Apple Spice drink! It is delicious! But, in all honesty, I still can't give any Starbucks more than three stars. Yes, I go there for an occasional mocha or seasonal drink, but they are soooo overpriced, and their coffee is just not that great. The hype of Starbucks bothers me, but I'm a sucker for branding, so I guess I'm a hypocrite. Oh well.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Mar 4, 2008~I was running late this morning and the hunger pains were kicking in on my way to work when I made a quick decision to drop-by Starbucks.  This particular one has a drive-thru, which is awesome, except everyone else thinks so too!  The line of cars was too long for my impatiences, so I decided to park and make a quick run inside.  Let me reiterate my need for quickness, as in swoop inside, place my order, get my coffee and split like an overripe banana. Of course when your in a hurry, no one else is.  So was my fate today at Starbucks.I've always had terrific and timely service at this Starbucks' drive-thru.  The person taking my order is always chipper and pleasant, and when I pull around to pick up my beloved cafe mocha, I'm always greeted with a smile and a lovely `"have a nice day.`" Not so when I entered the sanctimonious inner-chamber of Starbucks! No one to welcome me at the counter; baristas working here and there completely ignoring me; and me standing there trying to grab their attention with my awkward and annoyed demeanor.  Finally, a barista  glanced over and said something that was barely audible.  A minute later, he finally noticed me and said curtly, `"Wadda ya having?`"  `"Uh... a tall cafe mocha and, and, um, do you have blueberry muffins?`" `"Aren't there any over there?`" he pounced. I responded timidly, `"Oh, I guess so, I didn't look.`" He grabs a muffin and my drink and sets it on the counter.  Another barista, a surly old dude from the East Coast, pops by and says, `"Wadda get?`" I told him, gave him my credit card, he processes it, hands it back and moves on to the next person.  No `"thank you,`" or `"have a nice day.`" Nothing.  I was kind of stunned and walked out with a little huff and puff... and I wish I could blow his house down!So the lesson of this little story? Avoid the inside of this Starbucks at all cost, especially in the morning. Obviously the real gems work the drive-thru. I guess Starbucks 3hr shut down last week didn't cover customer service skills.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Mar 30, 2011~This is my neighborhood Starbucks|This is where ishhh gets done|Coffee|Netbook|StockMarket|Applying to Gradschool|Barista of the Store goes to BEN. Ben is a burly man full of smiles and very productive in his craft. Seems like an honest hard worker. Knows my drink, so I don't have say it...which isn't that confusing.  I have met a few other 'istas...they seem nice and genuine. As in anyplace, you go long enough and your relationship with the establishment grows to a deeper relaxation and realization.Still miss my most favorite cafe on the west coast...Albina Press in PORTLAND, OR. I'll be seeing you soon friend once the rain gets done. This places makes LUX look like the little red headed step child....with no soul.R\_ Note: If you like sitting outside, like most the people that come to this location....you will have to insert you alpha male ego to boost a table. May the best coffee drinking, liberal minded, pacifist win!    that would be a joke to watch...
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Mar 24, 2009~Being a Washington State girl, I am obligated to love Starbucks. And I do for the most part. I think I love the IDEA of Starbucks more than the actual coffee. I love their story and the history of the company. I love the green straws. It is branding at its finest and since I am in Marketing...blah, blah, blah. I am missing locally owned and operated corner coffee stands. I cannot believe these are not popular here in Phoenix. The drinks are usually much better, cheaper, and most offer punch cards to earn a free drink. Anyhow, this Starbucks is kitty-corner from my office...sweet! The staff is friendly and funny-ish. I'm sure I will know all of their names in no time at all.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~May 24, 2018~There are two Starbucks on 7th Avenue a block away from each other, while the other one is closer to me I go out of my way to go to this one. Every single staff member is friendly and happy.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jan 7, 2015~Awesome Barista's! Fast and friendly service! Graet Lattes
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jan 7, 2015~Awesome Barista's! Fast and friendly service! Graet Lattes
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Jan 10, 2014~Clean, fast, friendly! What more could you want? Minus a point for the location. I had to dodge 3 random people aimlessly walking/riding bikes around the parking lot. It's a while lot of the kind of people who aimlessly wander the Fry's parking lot next door. It's right next to a light rail stop in a shady part of town. Aaaaand I forgot to ask for my drink cold...they didn't ask but I don't have the heart to ask for it to be different because the lady was so nice. Thankful for a good hazelnut macchiato near by.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Sep 30, 2014~My husband and I were out and about and like so many pregnant women, with only a couple weeks left to go, I found myself with the sudden urge to use the bathroom. We stopped into a Starbucks on 7th ave and Camelback in Phoenix and noticed that they had keypad locks on the bathroom doors. I waddled up to the counter and asked the barista if I could please have the code for the ladies room. He asked if I was going to buy something because he could only give me the code if I made a purchase. I replied that I'm pregnant and need to use the bathroom now. He again repeated that I would have to purchase something. I glared at him and walked away to my husband and told him that I was denied access.Understandably, this upset Brad who marched right over to the Starbucks employee and in a forceful tone again stated that I am pregnant and should be granted use of the bathroom. They went back and forth for a moment, all the while the employee repeating that toilet access comes with a purchase. Finally Brad put his credit card on the counter and said, `"Charge me for whatever and give me the code!`". To this, the barista said no and refused to sell him anything, insisting instead that we leave and go to the Fry's down the street and use their facilities. A woman in line behind Brad who had been witnessing this bathroom denial insanity said that she was about to be making a purchase and asked for the code. The unrelenting employee refused and instead told my husband that if he didn't leave, he would be calling the police.At this point, Brad realized that my urge was becoming urgent so we left and used the bathroom at a much more accepting Subway next door. I don't know if there is any civil or federal code that permits access of a toilet to a pregnant women in the state of Arizona, but there should be extenuating circumstances regardless. Especially when there is no signage stating that the bathrooms are for customers only.I have never experience anything like this in my life. To unapologetically deny a very pregnant woman the use of a bathroom is wrong. This male barista exhibited a total lack of compassion and understanding, not to mention zero common scence. I hope that other pregnant women never have to experience this kind of embarrassment.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Sep 16, 2016~They remodeled the place and pushed the drive-thru so they have more time to prep but this place is slow and the cup is always dirty or the lid is wonky.  The only thing I do like is the workers seem out of it so no chatty convos to further ruin the morning.  I always fall for the short yet slow line and regret my choice after I pull out of the driveway.  No mo'
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Aug 20, 2015~I mean, it's a Starbucks. So, on the one hand, it's the same old thing. On the other hand, you know what you're getting is a reliably consistent product.This Starbucks, though, is near and dear to my heart as it's just a hop and a skip away from the house I lived in for four years. I have spent more time at this particular Starbucks than I'd like to admit. It's got a decent sized seating area on the inside and a large patio area to enjoy those sunny Phoenician days. The lighting is perfect for working and reading - not too glum, not too bright. The baristas here have always been friendly and super courteous, and attractive to boot.Go, enjoy, and let the shop know I'll be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 10, 2017~Arrived this morning around 645am asked for hot white mocha and bacon Gouda breakfast sandwich. After 10 min the girl gave me my drink but was sitting in drive thru window for 5 min before she realized it was for carry out. It was slightly cold and tasted nowhere near a white mocha. When i asked where my sandwich was a young lady said she was tossing in oven now. 5 more minutes goes by she gives me the bag and I go my merry way. By the time I reach my destination 5min later. Sandwich is cold as ice it was never even heated just tossed in a bag. The store had 5 to 6 people working at the time and I know that this store gets busy but the mgr (girl) was scolding a guy on what he should be doing. Sorry this will be the last time i waste my hard earned money on a lousy store.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Sep 12, 2016~It's Starbucks, I mean they all are pretty much the same..unless you are this Starbucks. If you have no where to be, love standing around, waiting, waiting, waiting, and waiting some more, you are in luck! Oh and you get to repeat your order as if it's the baristas first day each time. Unfortunately for me, it's the closest to my house. They recently remodeled, it looks the same to me. Ugh...I'm bored even writing this review.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~May 13, 2014~Slowest. Starbucks. Ever. Consistently. Very frustrating location. Better to head down the road to the next Starbucks, or, better yet, support local businesses!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Aug 23, 2018~Don't know if they changed their hours recently, but I've gone through the drive through around 5:15 am twice in the last week and no one takes my order. I see people inside setting up but nothing for the drive through. Never have problems when I get something in the afternoon. But I'll go somewhere else in the morning from now on.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jul 23, 2014~Really good staff here. They treat their regular customers as friends, as is the Starbucks way. If the indoor decor is ever updated, that will be a plus.Update 12-1-16: Indoor completely updated with a much better feel now.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Sep 18, 2017~The line is never that long! But i miss ordering the black tea with peach syrup. No longer has syrups anymore.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~May 22, 2017~Friendly and fast service and Nick is my favorite Startender as he makes the best vanilla frapp.  Great job to all the workers for dealing with all the good and the bad customers
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Aug 26, 2019~This Starbucks is fantastic! Due to the excellent customer service from the manager Michelle!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Jan 23, 2016~We came in at about 10 til close to order some hot chocolates.  Pastries were all already packed up for the evening.  There were trays of pastries in plastic baggies out on trays, but we were told they were not for sale.  Drinks were okay, but seemed watered down somehow.  One of the hot chocolates was too hot to drink immediately, although the others were fine.  One of the employees let us know upon receiving our drinks that they were closing in 5 minutes.  At 9pm he said rather loudly to a fellow employee that it was 9pm.  They seemed way to eager to close up and we were disappointed that pastries were already packed up.  If they close earlier than 9pm or are not offering their full menu til close, they ought to post that on Yelp so customers can choose another more welcoming location.  I have never been made to feel unwelcome in a Starbucks like this.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jul 23, 2017~It is rare to have quick service paired with great customer service, but this Starbucks has it! The moment I step in, I am greeted by every staff member. This Starbucks is fast and friendly! Coffee is a close second to level of genuine kindness from these green-aproned angels! In other words, if the rapture were to occur, this is where I'd want to spend my last moments.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Apr 21, 2018~This is my usual go to quick coffee grab, but today was not the normal standard one would expect from Starbucks. I ordered a nonfat chai, and as I pulled up to the drive thru the drink was white. Baristas should know just by looking at the drink it wasn't correct. She handed it over and I took a sip before driving away, and handed it right back saying it doesn't taste right. There was no chia in it, the milk also tasted awful. She took it, added maybe one more pump of chia and handed it right back. I drove away took a sip, and parked my car and proceeded to walk into the building. I went to tell another barista that I think the milk they are using has gone bad. She offered to make my drink again and I said sure, and apologized for being a bother. She remade my drink, which I am great full for, but the thing is she made it using an empty carton of milk which makes me believe that it was the same milk I had said had gone bad! So here I am stuck with a raunchy chai latte made with sour milk. Here is the thing, if I am going to pay $5 for a drink that isn't alcohol it better be good. To the manager of this location, you should really remind your employees there is a standard to making drinks at Starbucks. Also that if a customer says the milk has gone bad take a look at the milk you are using! -Former Starbucks Barista
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jan 19, 2018~I love this starbucks its my favorite one to go to i wont go anywhere else as this one has exceeded other starbucks in the area. This one is conveniently on the corner of Missouri and 7th ave which is a nice area. Although it may not be the biggest or nicest looking it has never been a disappointment. Always clean, the lines maybe be long during rush hour but man they really bust through them quick and all while embracing their customer service skills. I go to this one quite often because I live close, and everyone is always so excited happy and eager to work. Never had a bad experience not once. I think maybe my order got messed up like one but they were training someone so that's understandable and forgivable. Most starbucks in the area give me bland coffee that taste like straight coffee grounds even asking for extra pumps or after ordering a mocha frappe something that is supposed to be sweet. I do like to mix it up and get a cup of black coffee too or a cold brew but this place always gets it right no matter what I order. That is why im giving 5 stars
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Jan 29, 2014~I popped by this Starbucks because I wanted a scone. I appreciated that the calorie count was posted. Since I last had a Starbucks scone, they've changed the shape of their scones and the barista warmed it up without asking me. I don't like warm scones. I like their old scones better - at room temperature.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Mar 29, 2018~Worse location ever. They are rude, cannot make your drinks right and did I mention how rude they are. There is a better location at 7th st north of Missouri.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Jul 7, 2015~Starbucks is Starbucks is Starbucks all the world 'round.  Know what you will get.  Know they will spell your name wrong and the coffee will taste like it always does.  Love the app where you can pay and tip w/o using cash or card.  Also love love love the Cool Lime Refresher green coffee drink for after yoga - yummy.  They give you what you want, what you expect and do it in an efficient and friendly manner.  They are mighty tasty too.  I will always go back.  Can't help myself.  They were one of the first chain coffees and you get used to a certain flavor and taste.  Starbucks always delivers.  Drive thru is a bit of a pain in the ass though and slows down the whole bean process.  I prefer to go in, hear the music, smell the coffee and see them make my order.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Nov 22, 2012~I went to the Starbucks at 5344 N 7th Ave in Phoenix to meet a friend.  We decided to sit outside to sit outside on the patio.  Boisterous, loud, rude, childish behaviors are adjectives that come to mind for describing this location.  I thought I was in a Junior High cafeteria. I will never meet anyone at a Starbucks again it was that rowdy.  Frankly, I have nixed suggestions to meet their after the incident.  I don't know if it is this one location that is so unprofessional and lacking in any kind of adult behavior and I happened to catch the bad day but it totally turned me off of every returning.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Apr 26, 2013~this is a bright spot in a dismal area of Phoenix. The staff was nice and service is good. WiFi is free and it provided for a decent place to work for a bit.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Oct 30, 2012~Fast efficient - great Starbucks. Drive though too busy.  people Get out of your cars and sit down and relax with some coffee!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Oct 3, 2014~Do NOT go here. The baristas are extremely rude and lack even an iota of customer service understanding. For as much money as these locations rake in, they shouldn't be limiting bathroom use to anyone, let alone pregnant women who urgently need to go. Worse yet, they will refuse to sell you coffee just to make sure you can't use their bathroom. Unbelievable. You would think that a place that sells highly caffeinated beverages would understand that people need to pee. Evidently this place doesn't. Don't go here. Take your business to another coffee shop that doesn't have their toilet privileges locked down like Fort Knox and forces customers to beg to go pee after drinking their overpriced coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Apr 20, 2013~Slow, discombobulated, poorly laid out inside (serving the drive thru requires going back and forth thru narrow area where inside customers are being served from).
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~May 5, 2013~This Starbucks Coffee near 44th Street and Thomas is one I go to occasionally. The thing about Starbucks is if you go to one, you've been to pretty much all of them. I used to be a former partner too, so I know the deal.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Apr 14, 2014~Super friendly staff, and the drive thru is very  speedy ! They are always stocked with plenty of muffins and sandwiches !
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jun 9, 2016~This Starbucks is always quick which is ideal because I'm always in a hurry so they make it super convenient. The employees are super friendly too! Yummy drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Apr 25, 2013~I usually go through the drive-thru on my way to work; not sure why, as it's always extremely slow.  Nice folks work here, however, and it's convenient.SO expensive!  Seriously--60 cents for soy milk instead of dairy?  I really should stop.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Aug 20, 2016~Below average Starbucks in terms of efficiency and organization.  The drive through is consistently slow at all times of the day/week.  15 minutes from order to payment today with 4 ahead of me in line.  Tried the pre-order version on the app to see if that would be better.  After several weeks, my conclusion is, if it's just a drink, it's probably faster.  However, if you order a breakfast sandwich or any other food, it can take forever.  In my experiences, the food is done, but not moved out to the counter area for pick up.   I've had to ask about my food long after receiving my drink.  It's always on the back counter near the drive through area.  The folks working behind the counter are friendly, professional, working and staffing appears to be adequate so I am not sure what the problem is.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Oct 11, 2018~nice environment! went in for quick coffee and was treated really well:) definitely recommend coming here, the people are fantastic.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Nov 6, 2016~#undernewmanagement I've gone through the drive-thru many times recently and everyone has been really friendly! Went inside for the first time today! Quick, clean, and kind baristas. Place was packed and everyone seemed happy. Love the outside seating!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Nov 17, 2015~Good baristas, but lousy manager.   Spoils the whole atmosphere when she shows up and starts screeching at people.  Good reason to use the drive thru instead of going inside.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jan 30, 2014~This is my go to Starbucks. All of the staff are great ! Especially Matt who is always so friendly and such a pleasure to see. He's one of those people who brighten up your day. The lines are very long in the morning but other than that everything else is great. They also ever rarely mess up my order which happens most of the time at other Starbucks I go to.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Jun 21, 2012~I really am never one to complain, as I was a Starbucks barista for 2 years and I still work in the food and beverage industry. I understand that mistakes happen and the ins an outs of being a busy Starbucks barista are all too familiar to me. However, that being said, I drive through this location every morning at 6:30 am and order my drink. An iced quad venti nonfat extra ice stirred caramel macchiato. 2 of them actually. I moved to 7th avenue in January and was quite impressed. They always got it right and they definitely know how to keep the drive thru moving at busy times. But in the past 2 months my drink is almost never right. I have sent it back and asked for a little more syrup or caramel as it is usually too bitter, and still, it comes out too bitter the next morning and the next morning. I love my drinks and I love this company. Everyone is always friendly and prompt but I really just felt the need to express this, as $12.02 is my daily coffee budget and is my treat to myself daily. So I had to speak up.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Oct 21, 2015~Parking is in a small lot that gets pretty packed during peak hours. I come on `"off`" hours and it's usually pretty easy to get a spot. I haven't had any problems with the baristas and they've been really friendly. My issue is with the drive through here. I come here pretty often and have noticed that they definitely don't fill your hot drinks to the top! It doesn't happen when I order cold drinks...probably because you can see through the cup. 3 times already my cup was only about 2/3 full in a venti cup. The top of the coffee barely surpassed the top of the sleeve. What is going on?! If I'm going to pay more than $5 for coffee, can't I expect at least 80%? 75%? Anything?! Obviously getting drive through either means I'm in a rush or am not presentable, so I can't go in the store to complain. So I would definitely beware of the drive through with hot drinks here, or at least check before driving away from the window. Haven't had any problems in store though!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~May 12, 2021~As of my last visit a few days ago, I was able to sit inside in the nice, designer chairs.This is a top 5 Starbucks for me in Phoenix.Highly recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Apr 18, 2021~Starbucks with a large seating area and nice lounge type chairs but not allowing indoor seating or use of toilets.Staff is very good fulfilling orders. There's some nice outdoor seating but it's not cool on a HOT day(pun intended)to force paying customers to be forced to sit outside when I've seen staff allowed to sit inside.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Oct 22, 2023~On our visit we stopped to grab a coffee before our drive home to San Diego. Cashier was beautiful and very welcoming, great customer service. The barista that made our coffee may have been having a bad day or may not like her job. My daughter grabbed the wrong coffee (her other name is Taylor - the label said Taylor) the barista in braids said `"you know that's not yours? But you can have it it was a mistake.`" Ok thank you. When I asked if white mocha was added to my coffee, she was rude. When my daughter asked for extra caramel, she was rude. Word of advice, when people spend their hard earned money on a specific way they like their coffee don't be rude. My husband and I spent almost $40 on coffees and two sandwiches, our coffee was terrible. Instead of asking to fix it we walked away because this young lady was too rude. Be blessed you have a job. Unfortunately we won't be back to this location. Thank you.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Oct 4, 2022~Luis and all of my barista buddies are always the best Good Mornings before work!The are such an awesome team.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Nov 11, 2022~One of our favorite Starbucks.  The staff &amp; place is great. Love their crème brûlée.. it is a very clean place,you could sit inside
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Dec 3, 2014~place is dirty, workers are rude, and, there was a bug in my coffee.  Coffee mugs are not clean, and, they keeps their tables, chairs and areas dirty, you always have to ask to have them clean.  Bathrooms are gross.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~Oct 1, 2022~Ordered a Venti Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso and cold brew via the app. After driving away I looked at my Venti Brown Sugar drink and it's nearly empty... you can see from the photo they didn't fill it completely AND there is soooo much ice I basically just paid $6 for a tall... personally, paying $6 for a drink is a special treat for me and I don't do it often so this was a real bummer. DO BETTER!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Jun 14, 2019~This Starbucks wasn't too busy when I got here. It was a sweltering high of 112 that day, and I really needed something to cool off after walking around. I also wanted some sort of herbal tea. Looking at the menu, the comfort wellness tea looked intriguing but it's usually served hot. The barista was kind enough to make an iced version which was refreshing and very comforting at the same time! I liked the blend of different herbs and spices together. For your reference this tea has:Ginger, orange peel, chamomile, lemon verbena, spearmint, rooibos, licorice root, fennel, peppermint, orange oil, lemon essence oilSeating was plentiful and comfy. There are tables, soft leather chairs with ottomans, and the vibe was relaxed. Overall it was a nice little place to get a drink and chill for a bit.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Jan 24, 2021~The experience with this store alone makes me never want to go back to a Starbucks.  I have never had a good experience coming to this Starbucks (but have had good experiences with other locations). They change their hours what seems like daily. They posted a paper sign on their door with their new hours of 1230-7pm, when it says they are open on yelp/Apple Maps/google. The staff here is inexperienced and always makes my drink wrong. You have been warned!! Do not go to this Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Oct 6, 2023~During the past month, I ordered their seasonal apple croissants through the mobile app on three separate occasions, only to be told each time when I arrived to pick up my order that they were out. The last time I ordered at 6:30 a.m. and they had forgotten to update the mobile app indicating that they had run out, so I picked up my drink and waited several minutes for the croissants, then, as an afterthought, the barista asked me my name again and when I told her, she told me they had run out and that I could wait 7-10 business days for a refund or choose something else. On the prior two visits, I asked for refunds but nothing was ever posted into my PayPal, so this time I substituted for something else, something I didn't really want, because I figured that that would be less complicated than asking for another refund that, more likely than not, wasn't going to show up anywhere. When I tried to ask a different employee why they were out of the item already at 6:30 a.m., I was told that they only receive a very limited amount on delivery days, which had to be divided into daily increments until the next delivery. Then I asked why someone didn't report the problem to their district manager so they could have more stock on hand, the employee walked away while I was speaking to her and wouldn't answer me when I asked why she was walking away. Prior to walking away, I had also told her that other locations in the area always seem to have the croissants, and she told me then I should go to one of those locations. The thing is, I would have gone to another location if the employee(s) had done their job and updated the mobile app when they ran out of the item, because that would have prevented my money from being in limbo for 7-10 business days. Terrible, terrible merchandising practice. To top it off, the lid was not secured on my cup of coffee and it spilled all over my clothes and the asphalt in the parking lot. There have been at least a half a dozen times during the past 12 years that I have had what I consider to be serious problems with employees who are unable to communicate effectively and answer simple questions. I haven't decided yet if I will return to any Starbucks, because I refuse to beg anyone to be professional in exchange for my money. **UPDATE: I am boycotting Starbucks permanently because their employee's union got political about the war that is being fought in Israel and on the Gaza Strip.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~Sep 27, 2016~I have had several problems with my orders in the past, but when they do get my order right and have what I am ordering in the pastry case, everything is fine.  The drive-thru is extremely inconvenient because if too many cars are in line, some people cannot get out of their parking space until a couple of cars move up.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Sep 3, 2023~Horrible customer service!  I went inside and they're Very slow  to take your order. They all appear to be busy doing something else.  Finally when one of them comes to take your order there's no hello or good morning, no smile.  I will NEVER go back there.  Same with the woman who made the drinks. No smile just calls your name to get your order.  Considering how expensive their prices have become you'd think the service would match the amount of money we spend.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~2~Apr 20, 2022~For having only 6 cars ahead of me in line it took 30 minutes for me to finally get to the window. I normally go to a different location but this one was more convenient or so I thought. I ordered a drink I get all the time and do not have any issues or any other Starbucks. Generally not even at this one because I have been to this particular location and ordered before. However this time when I ordered my regular order it seemed difficult to even get it right. Then when I got to the window I noticed there wasn't really any milk added. I asked for more &amp; it came back the same. I was told I'd be charged for me. This time he'd give me some in a cup to add lol which again wasn't anything. He said normally an extra splash is literally a little splash. I'd be charged for anything more next time. Why would I want to go back for a next time? Beyond disappointed. The baristas normally make my day, but this one was right no matter what. Told me in the future I'd be charged.And my drink is still not even right. Thx Aaron for that.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Dec 4, 2019~Wow what a refreshing experience we just had at this Starbucks store. The customer service was top notch. Every time someone walked in they were greeted and every time someone left they were told thank you and to have a good day. Never in all the years that I have been going to many different Starbucks stores have I seen or heard that. We walked in and were greeted by all 3 ladies that were behind the counter. We stopped to look at the bags of coffee and cups when one of the ladies came around the counter and asked if we needed help with anything. This blew our minds. We went to the counter to order our coffee and everyone was so friendly and cheerful. We got our normal and it was made quickly and correctly. We sat down for a few minutes and nothing changed, they continued to greet everyone and take very good care of everyone. Big kudos to this store for excellent customer service, will definitely be back to this store in the future!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Dec 26, 2015~Huge interior with lots of seating. Love the big comfy chairs (all eight of them) with the reading lights. Currently, the best selection of Starbucks drinkware that is on sale (after Christmas) that I've seen anywhere in the area. However, when I asked what the size of a particular copper-looking mug was, the cashier had no clue. He did call over the barista who made an educated guess. Usually the bottom gives the size, but no luck on this particular mug.Usual drink choices here, but sadly all the red cups are gone until next year.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Dec 27, 2015~When searching for a coffee shop that serves reliably good coffee that suits your palette, sometimes one simply has to rely on the best.After checking out the list of coffee shops in the area, we couldn't find a local coffee shop that specialized in coffee. So we decided to hit the local Starbucks as we knew we would get what we expected-great coffee, great flavor and a guarantee that if it wasn't what we ordered they would remake it for us.We were not disappointed. The coffee here was the usual high standard that one expects from the number one coffee chain in the world!Every Starbucks store has its own unique ambiance and this one had a bit of everything to choose from. It had comfortable chairs, work tables, a large central meeting table, stools and high tables and outside seating as well.Thanks, Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Feb 6, 2019~The reason why this Starbucks is getting a huge fat zero is because the lady who took my order.I didn't get her name from the driver through. but if I did I would push you under the bus (metaphorically saying) I simply ordered from the Drive Through.My order: Green Tea Matcha latte (without sugar and Milk)By the time we got to the window! I asked again and reassured that she got my order right.Stating my order Green Tea Matcha Latte with no sugar and milk.And that the price should be lower because I order a Green Tea with Matcha Latte (No sugar and No Milk) Only the Hot water with Green Tea Matcha Powder.She hand me over my cup with `"Green Tea Bag`" which she don't get my order right. I took it as insult. And repeatedly told that the price should be readjusted and I order My Green Tea Matcha latte with No sugar and No milk with Only Hot Water.In couple of minutes passing, I'm breathing, going into Zen Mode because I need my Green Tea Matcha Latte with (No Sugar and No Milk)Yet she didn't readjusted the price so I'm paying for $2.45 for the Green Tea Bag And the Hard labor of think skills and a brand paper cup. I wanted my driver to find a parking spot so I can get this price fixed. But I had to be somewhere else, and I'm not going let this First World Problems Ruin my whole day. And In all the Starbucks I go to...always make the readjustment to the price. To total 0.87 cents only paying for the Green Tea With Matcha powder and Hot Water. Please remember my face and get my order right please.Thank you for reminding me not to get upset over (No milk and No Sugar) lol. Have a nice day.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Nov 11, 2022~I never have any issues at this location. My order is always correct and the employees are always super friendly - because of the consistency, this is probably my favorite location in the general area.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Dec 28, 2022~I hate to write this review, as the service is usually good here, but they gave me the wrong order on Christmas morning, when I spoke with the shift manager to get a refund she graciously offered to give me the correct order, free of charge, but it was the wrong one again.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Nov 26, 2019~I travel a lot for work and have been to many of Starbucks in 42 different states and this location on 7th street is hands down in the top 1% of Starbucks.Coffee is on point, service is fast and friendly. One barista (I think named Honey(?)) is always a Dear, friendly, attentive, and a wizard at mixing up tasty caffeinated beverages. I wish I could give half stars to make it a 4.5 star. Way better than that bikini beans spot. Sidenote the bar behind it pomeroys is great too.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Jan 18, 2021~I'm visiting from out of town and have been here for 3 weeks and love the staff here: they are so nice and hustle. The line is like non existent! I messed up my app order this morning and they totally accommodated me. Thank you Daniella for being so sweet every-time I come in!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Sep 13, 2022~Worse customer service ever had in starbucks.cant even answer a simple question and very rude to customers...i don't recommend this starbucks..try different other locations folks...
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~Jun 9, 2019~This is a pretty nice Starbucks like any other, and with lots of room. When my brother and his GF and I were here we noticed and were surprised it closed so early in the evening.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~2~Oct 17, 2019~Wasn't the best experience. I mobile ordered the new grilled cheese sandwich which I've had before and it was amazing. This one wasn't warm. The cheese wasn't even soft. Didn't even look at it until I got back to my office to eat lunch. Not happy because they are not cheap.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~Jul 20, 2022~Very sad that a $7 small iced white mocha only tastes like oat milk. Just because it says oat milk doesn't mean the whole drink only has to taste like oat milk. Haven't gone to this location in awhile, place used to be very consistent.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~2~Mar 6, 2019~Overall disappointing visit to this Starbucks. I placed a mobile order and when I came in only half of my items were waiting for me. When I asked about the other items the very disinterested barista told me I could go and grab them myself. When I asked for a bag to carry my items in she looked very out out, found a bag and tossed it to me. Apparently I was looking a little lost trying to find my other items when another barista, maybe the manager or lead told me she would get my items. Unfortunately all they had were overripe bananas so I was given a coupon for next time. This barista's service is the only reason I have 2 stars.And finally when I got to work and prepared to eat my oatmeal they out way too much water in it so I have oatmeal soup. I have multiple Starbucks locations available to me in the mornings and I will probably skip this one for awhile.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Apr 11, 2011~This location is always fast, friendly and the staff are knowledgable and work great as a team. It's here that they introduced me to an iced orange blossom tea which is really good, takes time to prepare but they take the time and do it right!!!It would get 5 stars but their restrooms (male that I know) is not in great or clean shape (or stocked for that matter) most of the times I come here in the afternoon.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Mar 10, 2019~I go to this location often as I frequent a yoga studio in the same shopping center. This is not the first time I've felt the employees were standoffish, but after my experience today I had to write a review. I ordered two large pink drinks with light ice. The barista (female with short dark hair) turned to the man making the drinks and said `"Make sure you put extra ice in that pink drink.`" Thinking she was referring to my order, I politely said, `"Oh, I said light ice.`" She turned to me and said, `"That's for a different one. I know how to do my job. Thanks!`" ...I was shocked! I was super nice to her and I guess she must have been having a bad day, but still- not an excuse to be rude/passive aggressive to me. I would call and voice my concern but I'm not sure if she's a manager there- I've seen her there before. I felt super uncomfortable and not sure I'll go there anymore, or at least as often. Enter at your own risk!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~May 4, 2015~My preferred place for relaxing and browsing the web while enjoying a refreshing iced beverage (iced caffe mocha being my fave) or an invigorating hot latte or cafe americano. The staff is friendly, the place is always clean and there are lots of places to sit, both inside and in the outdoor patio area. Parking is never a problem, as it  shares the very large parking area of the commercial complex at the corner of 7th St. and Missouri.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Oct 20, 2017~Best Starbucks I've been to in Phoenix. I've tried 7 places near by, currently the best for studying! Also I've heard there drive-through is super fast!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Nov 16, 2018~It's just after 4:30  a.m. and I have so much work today. My whole family is sleeping and I don't want to disturb everyone with video conferencing, etc. Luckily this location is open early and ready with coffee and a calm, quiet, welcoming place to get things done  Just a few in and out stragglers and a steady line at drive thru makes this spot the perfect destination for productivity right now. In fact the only thing I can think of that might make it even better on this cold Arizona morning is a toasty warm fire place. Seating inside is spacious and there are lots of different choices which is extra appealing. Bistro tables, lounge chairs, booth type areas and a long table are versatile for accommodating lots of different people but for now I practically have the place to myself while I plug-in then login and get in an early morning call with team on the east coast.    Bonus: the music at this location is mellow and coffee house cozy so it doesn't dominate my thoughts or the atmosphere. Much appreciated in this moment!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Oct 31, 2013~Very `"inviting`" staff! met the manager Ben... who was extremly friendly, spoke to me for over 5 mins... which was pleasantly surprising! clean restrooms... big plus!!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Sep 12, 2013~I often go to this shop and I enjoy it.  It's a bit larger than usual so you can do work at the tables or relax in the large chairs.  The staff is friendly and by now they usually know my order.  Lots of parking and the drive-thru is fast.One con is that the large chairs tend to have crumbs in them.  You have to do a brush down before you sit.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Sep 29, 2013~My favorite Starbucks so far!  It's spacious and comfortable inside.  This is one of the newer locations, so everything inside looks good!My only issue with this place: Get a better internet provider...  Wow the internet can be rough here...!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Aug 17, 2015~I like this specific location for several reasons:1)  Easy accessible parking. This Starbucks shares its location with other grocery stores. There's plenty of spots. 2)  Lots of space to sit and/or study.  I have been here on multiple Saturdays/Sundays and have been able to find a little table and /or seat for myself.  Free wifi.  3)  Friendly fast service in my experience. The negatives:1) The music is way too loud. I know it's supposed to be fun to have the loud music, but whoa, a bit much! 2)  One restroom, but that's typical.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Oct 17, 2015~I'm not a hard guy to please when it comes to coffee. I like the iced coffee with cream. My other go to is the iced green tea with 2 Splenda. Sign up for their rewards program to get a free drink on your birthday as well as a free one after 15 stars.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~May 5, 2014~I spend a lot of money each month on my iced coffees and I love Starbucks, but this location gets my drink wrong EVERY time I go there. The reason I continue to go to this Starbucks location is because it is so close to my work and I only get a 30 minute lunch. I wish they could get their service in check!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Oct 10, 2017~Staff were super nice, and the atmosphere around was very inviting for doing work or just hanging out. I ordered an iced vanilla latte and tasted great so I'd definitely recommend this location!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~Jul 19, 2012~Dude, it's a Starbucks...just like the other one down the street from the other 4 just around the corner...My one and only visit to this location (so far) was pleasant and I successfully ordered, acquired, mixed, and drank my Americano.  Mission accomplished.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Aug 11, 2012~I try to support local coffee shops in general (grow your local economy, folks!), but Starbucks' vanilla rooibos, when served over ice, just cannot be beat.  So I frequent Starbucks too!Not. This. One.For some reason, this location just cannot handle serving this brewed tea iced.  It is literally the only location that I've ever been to that flat out refuses to do it (on three separate occasions, by three separate baristas).  I give up!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~May 26, 2016~Some workers there are very nice and some give an attitude. Few times drinks not done correctly for example asking for no foam and I end up getting foam on top of my coffee. I am giving the three stars based on the staff there as I stated some are nice where they will make your experience great and some I believe is due to the monotonous work they are working so therefore don't care. The staff can either make or break any kind of business!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Aug 10, 2019~Everyone is so engaged in their own way of living, or own little bubble, the coffee I have not tasted yet simply because of my own issues, but as I say and felt sorry for myself I looked around and saw how similar we are were and is a beautiful thing because that means this BUCKS team really keeps a comfortable atmosphere so everyone can feel comfortable which is a beautiful thing. I'll def be back at different times to see even more excellence from this team
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Oct 27, 2010~I'm not a huge starbucks fan, but my friend and I came here to study, and this is a great place for studying!  In fact, all the other people here were studying too! We will become regulars! Btw the staff is very friendly, but then have you ever been to a starbucks where the staff wasn't??Don't get the pumpkin spice frappachino unless you want to die from sugar overload!! Yuck!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~Mar 13, 2016~I love this location because it doesn't get as busy as the 16th st and Bethany location (at least during the times that I have been there). I tend to stick to drive thru and my drinks are always good and they have friendly service. I did go inside once because the drive thru line was too long. My drink took a really long time (a flat white) to come out and they completely forgot my banana nut bread order. I had to ask twice about it so I was not happy with the service that day. Not sure if they were just having an off day or what. Inside it's pretty spacious compared to many other Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Sep 16, 2016~This used to be my favorite Starbucks. There are at least four other Starbucks that are closer to me, but I would drive past them all to go to this one. I spent countless hours and dollars here working on my bachelor's and master's degrees. They had this awesome giant conference table where you plug in and spread out your books and papers. They had good lighting for studying and coloring. And over Labor Day weekend, they destroyed all of it. Gone is the giant table with the good lighting. I no longer have any reason to return. Shame on you, Starbucks, for making your stores as uncomfortable as possible. I guess quantity served is more important than the quality of the customers' experiences.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Apr 20, 2016~While I love the interior of this location, the service has repeatedly been horrible. My drink order has been wrong on too many occasions to count and as someone who primarily uses the drive-through, I am often not realizing their mistake until I am home. I have been given drinks that I did not order (obviously they mistakenly gave me someone else's order), had to repeat my order multiple times for them to only then get it wrong, and am repeatedly given regular milk when I have requested soy. It is unfortunate that this Starbucks is in my neighborhood and the closest to my home because it is by far the worst Starbucks I have ever been to.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Jun 18, 2016~Despite the long drive thru line, they were really great. Happy to be there and helpful. Super efficient too.  Keep up the positive attitude!  I can see why people come over and wait patiently.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Nov 27, 2017~Horrible service all the time. The drive-through is always backed up no matter what and they have to give away their drinks for free half the time because it takes so long. One of my last visit I told the lady I wanted almond milk (because of my lactose intolerance) and she brought me soy milk in my drink (which I'm also allergic to) and I don't like to complain and I'd already waited in the line far longer than I should have an was running late so I just ended up paying for a drink I had to throw away. My most recent visit I went in because the line was so long at the drive-through, inside wasn't busy at all but for some reason it still took 15 minutes for them to make my drink which I only I realized was even made cause the lady who came in 5 minutes after me went up and found her drink waiting there (for however long) because no one called anyones names or drinks out letting them know they were ready, they were just putting drinks over there and just walking away.  I walked over to see if my drink was there and (what was supposed to be my drink) didn't have a name or drink name anywhere on it (so how would anyone even know it's their drink being that names/drink orders weren't being called). I finally realized that drink was made incorrectly (hot instead of iced like I ordered) and they went to remake it to remake it and I took my drink expecting it to be made properly this time but they put whole milk in it, even though I requested almond milk and ended up drinking a decent amount of it before I realized it wasn't almond milk. So not only did I have to have my drink remade cause they didn't properly make it the first time but I got a drink that actually made me violently sick because I drank something that was supposed to be in my dietary restrictions but it wasn't made properly the second time. Never going back to this location again ever again.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Feb 4, 2017~After a night of drinking and not knowing our way around town we found this starbucks.  The neat thing is it had the same feel as every other starbucks with an Arizona twist.  The location was clean and restrooms were golden.  Usually I do not drink sugary drinks but I had to give in.  Me and the gf grabbed double Fraps...and I got the whip cream too!  The drinks were amazing and the location had a good vibe where you can sit and talk.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars came from the wait time.  It wasn't super bad but it was long enough for the conversation between 2 people to pause and focus around where's our drink
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Oct 16, 2012~I hate the Starbucks on 7th, the really ought to fire the entire staff there and start from scratch.  I order an Iced Venti Chai Tea Latte.  It's pretty simple, it's right off the menu, no add-ons.   I often shop at the Basha's in the same complex, so every once in a while, I used to stop off at this Starbucks.  It is an abomination.  They never put the milk back in the fridge, the don't listen to your order, or if they do, they give you someone else's drink.  It's not just one thing, it's EVERYTHING about it, from the rude staff to the inept staff to the inept staff to the rude staff.In any case, just drive by this Starbucks and hit the one on 16th and Bethany, where they always get your drink right the first time.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Oct 8, 2016~The Crew at this Starbucks is amazing!! They are always Soo friendly and attenative to all details!! My Satalite early morning office!On there game always!! The manager of the store is always working hard!!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Jun 16, 2018~At 12:15 on a Saturday, very slow service and the counters were messy with garbage and spills. One employee, apparently at the end of her shift, stood at the machines texting while people moved around her. The man serving drinks did not say a word beyond calling the name- when I said thank you he walked off. Same for others. This is not my typical experience at Starbucks. There are enough around that I will not be back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~2~Jan 9, 2008~Booooo Booooo! I'm NOT a StarYucks patron. Really. I'm not. However some evil friend gave me a StarYucks gift card and of course I had to use it. So. I tried. I don't do the half caf, part skim, part whole, chai, with light chocolate sprinkles venti grande tallie or whatever. I truly  hate those people. But I did request a soy latte. They were out of soy. Hmmm...Ok. I run a restaurant, I understand running out of products. Next day, same StarYucks. Same drive thru. Same monster in the window. Soy Latte please. Sorry, no soy milk. Oh for crap sake. This StarYucks is 200 yards from a grocery store. That sells soy and other market goods. So I peeled out, went to Lux, and my world was at peace. Once again.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Jun 15, 2015~Always cordial. Always clean. Quality product. Pleasant environment includes free WiFi. its just a nice place to be if you can afford the product.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~Nov 1, 2009~We drive through here every Saturday  and Sunday on the way to dog park.  First off, I like Starbucks coffee, and the hearty rich punch of coffee flavor.  I like that Starbucks does an `"Americano`", which is probably their only `"frou-frou`" drink other than a  latte that exists in the non-Starbucks world.  I've found some independents don't do Americano's because they think it's too `"Starbucks`".  Go to France folks, `"Americanos`" all over.  So knowing that I like Starbucks, here's the scoop on this shop:1) Service is inconsistent - sometimes courteous, quick and spot on (usually the Sunday AM lady who is currently out due to knee surgery), but sometimes they are slow and get the order all wacked up and forget things. 2) the blender is near where the person taking the order often stands.  `"I'd like a wrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  A what? whrrrrrrrrrrrrr....3) Sometimes panhandlers hang our at the drive through.  Hasn't happened in the last month or so, but has occurred more than once.  We always notify the person at the window - don't know if they do anything about it4) Inside is generally clean and neat5) When I do go inside, I inevitably get stuck behind people who like to blab about themselves to the person behind the counter, other people in line, or someone on the cell.  Maybe that's  just a weird coincidence.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~2~Feb 26, 2013~Need some iced love!  At least I can say Starbucks is consistent in making really bad coffee.  Add lots of sugar and milk and you'll never really notice.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Nov 30, 2015~Quick for drinks and lots of tables and seating for studying. Stays pretty calm inside too, perhaps because of drive through.  Great study spot!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Feb 7, 2014~Terrible! Today was the 4th, yes 4th time they have messed up my order. 1st, they forgot my sandwich, 2nd they sent my sandwich to the drive thru, 3rd they sent my iced coffee to the drive thru, and a day later (!) They forgot to make my coffee altogether. Mind you, the last time I was the ONLY person in line. How is that even possible. I can't tell you how many free drinks I've gotten out of this location. These most recent 4 issues are just in the past month. There are many more I could go in to, but I don't have the time or energy to start. If you can put up with the service, then I would say go there to just get free drinks!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Jun 5, 2009~I have to say that even though I am not a huge Starbucks aficionado, coming here last night was pleasant..  After patronizing Starbucks in NYC and San Fran for 2 years each, its nice to finally be able to sit down and have a cup of coffee, without there being a 1,001 people in or out at all times, thus making it a very unpleasant experience.  The drive-thru was not busy and only 2 people were there with on laptops.  The employees at the counter were very nice, and we were chatting up a storm. Knowing that I will be able to come in here without a line during 5 p.m., is something of value to me. I would say I am glad to have this location in my neighborhood, and will be returning soon! Thanks guys!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Jan 15, 2016~I have gone to this Starbucks for awhile, and every time the wait was over 10 minutes, not because they were busy but because they were slow at making drinks. This time I was waiting for over 15 minutes  and when I got my drink was under filled by an inch. I am now going to go to Dutch bros because their coffee is better, and they know what they're doing.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Jul 27, 2017~They always make my boyfriend's and my order quickly through the mobile app. We're glad such a nice location is so close to where we live! Coming inside is usually MUCH quicker than the drive-thru though.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Jan 7, 2013~The drive thru here is very efficient, and the staff is always nice and friendly, even at 6am on a Monday (always appreciated!). My only complaint is that sometimes my extra hot coffee is not so extra hot :-(
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Mar 13, 2014~Not a bad location and definitely way easier than the Bethany Home and 16th St. Starbucks to get in and out of. Definitely a fan!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Nov 16, 2015~Can't make a damn caramel macchiato for the love of god. If I could've put zero stars I wouldve.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~Jul 2, 2014~Average location with drive thru. Employees friendly, but still got a one drink order wrong after confirming at drive thru speaker when ordered and at window where you pay.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Jun 3, 2014~Baristas here are rude! Try to avoid this Starbucks as much as possible. When my dad ordered his drink with his accent the barista (Hanna) at the drive through made fun of him! How insulting. When it was my turn to place my order I made sure to share with Hanna a couple of customer service tips. She was so embarrassed she had someone else give us our drinks. I wish I would have had the chance to talk to the manager about her behavior, but honestly I had more important things to do. Also, on Sunday when I went through the drive through they quickly told me what my total was without asking if there was anything else that I needed. `"I am not done yet! `" and then the guy laughed. Apparently everything you tell them is a joke. Also, last month they were out of venti cups..... I personally love Starbucks, but when it comes to customer service one bad experience it's all it takes to  lose the loyalty.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Feb 8, 2016~Andrew, Reyna and Daniela great customer service, they make really good drinks here and always receive you with a smile; keep up the amazing job guys! So glad I've chosen this location and adopted it as my favorite one
Phoenix, AZ 85014~2~Aug 5, 2014~Generally, my experiences at this Starbucks have been OK (nothing `"special`" or `"extraordinary`"); however, while I was ready to give it a `"regular`" 3 stars, I have to take away one star because of how one employee named David is a legitimate douchebag.  The men's toilet was backed up, and I had to go to the nearby Bashar's to use their restroom instead.  I had no choice but to throw away the cup I was using (and was planning on using to get a refill).  When I returned, I asked for another drink, but at the price I'd pay for a refill.  David asked for a cup, and when I told him I had to leave because of their toilet being backed up and had to discard the cup, he said, `"I need a cup before I can give you a refill.`"  When I pointed out to him, `"I wouldn't have had to throw away the cup if it wasn't for the fact that your toilet was backed up,`" he said, `"no cup, no refill.`"  Throughout the whole exchange, he was barely making eye contact and had a slight attitude.  I get that he was likely following what he was probably told in training, but at the same time, he could have been more accommodating due to the fact that it was THEIR toilet that was backed up, and forced me to leave and come back in order to relieve myself.  Either David needs a corrective meeting with his supervisor, or get out because of his douchebag behavior (which is not acceptable).
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Dec 7, 2024~Boy do I love their special grilled cheese sandwich.   I'm now addicted to this grilled cheese sandwich even for breakfast...can you imagine????  Grilled cheese for breakfast, why not?  Thanks Parker for the great tip.  Actually, all their breakfast items are really very tasty and  deeelicious.   This Starbucks is clean and very inviting.   It has the vibe of what neighborhood java places has and thank you to the staff here for keeping this Starbucks culture alive.  See you soon.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Nov 25, 2024~This is my happy place one of my cherished hideaways.   What makes this place of business unique is not even the java, it's the camaraderie and authentic friendships of not only the staff to each other but the genuine care the staff has for the regulars as well as the newcomers.  The coffee and specialized coffee tastes consistently great and the display of Christmas products are beautiful.   The ambiance is welcoming.   And their food menu items are never stale; their delivery truck comes I believe almost every night.  You can always ask the staff how fresh their goods are.  Don't forget to download the Starbucks app to get rewards and also get free refills with your app.  Ask your friendly staff how this rewards work.  AND FINALLY....JUST RELAX YOU'RE AMONG FRIENDS.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Nov 19, 2024~It's the neighborly coffer shop around the corner that we over a certain age remember fondly.  Whatever reason we use to come to this watering hole, I want to thank the friendly staff for caring to know more than my coffee but what's going on with my life now.  The music is always sooo cooll.The breakfast food is reallly excellent .  Ciao!!!
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Nov 8, 2024~Tis the season to bust out those ugly aweaters...kidding aside your local Starbucks has transformed their looks and menu to welcome the holiday season not to mention your regular favorites.   Don't forget to visit your local Starbucks and start shopping for your favorite Auntie or cousins even your frenemies deserve a seasonal cup.  So, let's for ready and welcome the fall season officially.   Coso...this is the season for giving.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Nov 4, 2024~Boy what a Monday mornin,, kind of dragging my weekend behind.  Got my go to java...the blonde roasted coffee.    The staff at this particular Starbucks are all excellent.   The vibe of this java spot is like what a neighborly spot should be - friendly.   Thanks for making my Monday morning a good onr.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Nov 1, 2024~Look at who the cat dragged in...me.  I need my usual breakfast. In any case,  hope to see you around with your favorite Starbucks breakfast of champions.  The staff as usual greeted and welcomed me in.  The ambiance is great and really quiet at this time.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 29, 2024~Good morning AZ...happy Tuesday...I am dragging a bit this morning.   At the suggestion of my barista at Starbucks cold brew will have more caffeine than a regular blonde roast drip coffee.   So here goes nothing...lol have an amazing day.  With a great staff to take care of my java needs., I can't go wrong with this great suggestion.   The atmosphere is inviting as always.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 23, 2024~Goodwood morning AZ....rise and shine.   Got to my fave Starbucks location.   Got my sandwich with a Fall coffee beverage. My local Starbucks staff knows my customized java needs.  Thanks to the starbucks staff for always making my visit special.   Truly your neighborhood java place...at least one of my many coffee stops in the valley.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 20, 2024~What a way to Starr the day.   A breakfast sandwich of your choice paired with your favorite Fall beverage.   Say hello to your friendly Sunday crew;  they're all ready for your unique orders.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 12, 2024~Good morning AZ!  Rise and shine and smell the coffee.   I'm enjoying a fall beverage.   Why don't you stop by and fill yourself up with the Fall goodness...pecan coffee beverage or your fave cold brew coffee beverage.   The crew is great and nice to see old familiar faces and new ones.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 4, 2024~TGIF...where's everyone???? Forgot there must be a lot of homework from school.  Or there must be a house party somewhere.   In any event,  I am enjoying my me time here at your friendly local Starbucks.   It's cool music and clean shop.  The dessert is something took forward to.   Thanks Fall for the cool beverages.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Sep 27, 2024~Glad to be back here tonight.   TGIF indeed.  Great Fall lineup of coffee beverages.   So nice to see familiar faces and meet a few new faces.   The service is great always welcoming.   The staff is friendly and knows me not just the name on a cup of coffee.   The ambiance for a Friday evening is inviting because I missed the crowd.  The drive thru seems busy as usual for this 24 hour location at least on a Friday night.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Sep 18, 2024~I love this particular Starbucks location.  Plus the staff are great.  They are always friendly and helpful especially when I need to customize my order.  The ambiance is inviting.   Plus their Starbucks products are of good quality.   A little bit on the pricey side but worth it.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 11, 2023~Great Fall beverages selection. Same friendly staff who can customize your order.  Awesome staff who are there always working hard to get your usual order right every single time.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 3, 2023~My original fave spot before I discovered other favorites.  I love their new hours.  Still the same crew for the most part.  There are new faces as well, but they still got me.  Welcome to Fall and old and new Fall beverages.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Aug 15, 2023~Great staff and their coffee  shop is run efficiently by multi-tasking baristas who lnow your orders and name by heart
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Nov 21, 2024~I Ordered 3 drinks at 7:51 this morning and walked out at 8:20. It took them 30 minuets to make three drinks, THREE! The store was so unorganized this morning and a 30 minute wait Even for Starbucks is ridiculous. It was super chaotic and it felt like no one knew what do to. Non-to mention that someone walks in in orders 12 drinks and gets them within 10 minutes and I saw at least three people come back in after getting their orders Having been messed up My order was also rung up wrong, but I didn't have time to wait another 15 to 20 minutes to fix it. Let alone pay to wait another 15 to 20 minutes to get the item that was missed when I originally ordered. I usually never have a problem at this Starbucks, but This morning was not one of those cases.
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~Aug 28, 2022~Drinks are what one expect from Starbucks. Order inside, in the drive thru, online or on the app. This location has outdoor seating. There are several trees and umbrellas that keep the area fairly shaded. A bike rack is available on the side facing Thunderbird. This location is a little further away from the freeway.  Drive thru line can get a little long. Though it does move quickly. If parked where the line backs up, it can be hard to get out of parking lot. A couple spaces up front are designated for mobile orders.
Peoria, AZ 85381~3~Sep 7, 2023~They've significantly gotten better with their drinks but only downside is that the parking lot is pure chaos. People can't seem to follow the arrow that says you're supposed to line up starting from the back and not in the parking lot. I got caught trying to get through the parking lot just now. A car lined up in the middle of the parking lot and I was trying to get around them and at the same time, another car was trying to get out of their parking spot. And because this is a 24/7 Starbucks, good luck finding a spot to sit inside and parking can sometimes be hard to get.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Mar 4, 2021~I guess I came in when they were busy but I should've stopped and asked someone if the brown sugar syrup was missing cause this just looks and tastes like a plain latte.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jan 14, 2021~I've come in here a few times and never had any problems with service or drinks. But this visit today in particular was the most notable. I came in to get drinks to go for me and my sister and I didn't notice until I got home that I dropped an important piece of paper with a code to complete an injection certification class I just attended. It was about an hour after I left and so I called right away cause COVID protocols mean more frequent cleaning. Rachel picked up the phone and helped me out and actually found my paper and read it off to me. It should be noted that while she was helping me, she was also helping out other customers. So kudos to her for doing a great job multitasking and doing me a solid. Thank you!!
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Feb 25, 2024~First coming here the last three times no matter the time , they are out of the popular donuts . They have 5 people back there and one working !!!! I understand trying to save some money on not making to many donuts but this place is rediculous. Don't stay open all day of your not going to offer a full menu!!! It does nothing to complain  but I will post on here every time this happens. Call it Dunkin Donuts Not Have Donuts instead.
Peoria, AZ 85381~3~Aug 9, 2024~Drive through times must be terrible. The Starbucks I worked at in Texas was busier and our window times were always 39-50 seconds. This one's gotta be sitting at a minute and a half. Put me in there and I'll bring it down immediately
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Feb 17, 2024~This Starbucks is probably the slowest in AZ. Sat in line for over 45 minutes. Had I known I would have gotten out of the line.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Nov 4, 2018~I will never be going back to the Starbucks again. Customer service was terrible and the wait was ridiculous. I got there at 10:25 and waited almost 30 minutes to get four drinks. There was maybe five people in the lobby at which most of them had their drinks already. Absolutely terrible i'll go to the other ones that nearby and just stick to my Dutch brothers
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~Sep 15, 2021~Super convenient location off 83rd x Thunderbird.  Not a whole lot for ample parking as typical with most Starbucks.  The drive-thru, of course, is the most popular and I typically avoid it at this particular location.  It's a cluster because unfortunately, you can enter the drive-thru from two different locations.  You can sneak around the back by the dumpster and enter from the adjacent car wash parking OR you can enter from the parking lot entrance off Thunderbird.  As such, there are now two different lines forming into the drive-thru resulting in a lot of butthurt from those who think they've been cut off and general confusion.The parking lot and entrance way are both clean.  I've been greeted when I enter the location and at no point in time as my order even been screwed up.  I always get the various drinks that I prefer and don't typically get any food or snacks so I cannot comment on the food.Employees have always been friendly and courteous to me.  Not quite sure why there's so much hate for this particular location.  It's a Starbucks.  Not really sure what it is you're expecting.  I'd knock off 1-star simply due to the fact that the drive-thru engineer really needs to be terminated from their job.  You need ONE way into the drive-thru with a single-file line of vehicles to alleviate the middle fingers from all the entitled brats who think their morning is more important than everyone else's.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Nov 8, 2023~Just went through the line and had such a pleasant experience with the window worker Summer. She was so joyful and shared a great conversation with us, she also offered to remake a drink without us even asking because she noticed it was not up to standard. Thankful for her this morning!
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Dec 13, 2022~Peppermint chocolate cold foam is spectacular. SBux please stop making new &amp; incredible cold foams!  This location is great. I've never had a bad visit. They make orders fast &amp; accurate. Thanks guys!
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jul 10, 2023~I love starbucks, their coffee is great!! Also no matter the location, all of their employees all have great attitudes!!! If you've never been, I highly recommend!! You'll leave with a smile on yr face and happy taste buds
Peoria, AZ 85381~3~Apr 12, 2022~Nice people work here.But for 6.00 plus for a venti cup of Cinnamon Dolce Latte is way to much and they cant even fill it to the top. But I guess that is why itis called StarBucks. Over priced
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~Nov 26, 2023~Just left....asked the drive thru barista to load our Starbucks card. She didn't and charged my debit card for the purchase. When a customer hands you a debit card and a Starbucks card. Just assume they want to load the Starbucks card. Ask how much. We just bought 4 drinks and would have loved to get our points. Just a little bit of training and you would be amazing.
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~Jan 5, 2022~One of my favorite locations! The employees are always super friendly and kind. Will have enjoyable small talk and they are fast and efficient. Drinks are always correct and have not been served a gross drink. Only irritating part of this location is the drive thru. Oh my gosh it's so busy all the time. It's a 24/7 Starbucks to compete with the Dutch in the same plaza but the drive thru is always packed and it's very hard to get in. I usually just stick to going in
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Dec 29, 2022~I like coming to this 24 hour Starbucks location versus the hood in Phoenix. All my drinks are made exactly how I want it &amp; no complaints.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Mar 19, 2022~I don't expect much from Starbucks, I know half of the time they'll either butcher my drink or name and I've accepted it. I've accepted it because even they mess my drink up I can figure out a way to drink it but today is just unacceptable. I asked for the caramel `"drizzle`" to be at the bottom of the cup instead of around the cup. I don't know if they were being extra sweet (no pun intended) or they are unsure how much is a `"drizzle`" the caramel they put is out of control I can barely taste my cold brew. At least they were nice today
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Sep 1, 2018~This store is just the one from 75th ave and thunderbird relocated to 83 ave and thunderbird. The new store is very nice. Much more room and a drive through. Many of the old people are there along with many new and nice people. I have always been treated well by this group. Many know my name and I know many of their names but with the new people it will take some time. Go see them you will get a warm welcome.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Feb 14, 2017~I go to several different Starbucks. This store has the nicest people. I have been retired 6 years. I have been coming here for those 6 years almost every day. Some times twice a day. I have always been treated well. They get busy and rushed at times but I am always greeted with a smile and a hello Craig. I now usually order ahead and my drink is ready when I arrive. I have over350 checkins but have been here well over 600 times, probably more like 1000. It is part of my daily routine along with many I see there every morning. The people here is what makes this place a great coffee/drink spot. Come see them.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 22, 2015~I have been coming to this Starbucks for over 4 years. It is a morning routine.  I have a little poodle that is blind. She follows me around the house till we go for coffee. She gets 1/5 of a pumpkin loaf cake.  This store has the nicest people. Our mode of transportation is golf cart or 1929 Chevy 2 door sedan.  I go to several different Starbucks. This store always treats us very well.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 11, 2023~Fastest and friendliest Starbucks I've ever been to. This is the only Starbucks I'll go to because I know I'll be in and out no matter how long the drive thru line is! They've never gotten my order wrong, either.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Oct 30, 2022~You'd think after paying $7 for a drink that they'd at least fill up the cup? This is DESPICABLE!! What a joke.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 19, 2022~Thank you so much for my birthday drink!  MJ Was so sweet and doing such a great job! Way to treat your customers the best!!!
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jan 24, 2020~Awesome Starbucks, employees are always welcoming and helpful. Drinks are always on point, and atmosphere is inviting, safe, and fun. 10Highly recommend if you need to study and need a place that's open a little later than others.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Aug 22, 2019~Awesome Starbucks, employees are always welcoming and helpful. Drinks are always on point, and atmosphere is inviting, safe, and fun. 10/10 Highly recommend if you need to study and need a place that's open a little later than others.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Nov 20, 2022~My drink was good but the food was terrible. I got the Turkey Pesto Panini and this I what I got... barely any pesto &amp; like 4 peppers all clustered together, with one small piece of turkey. False advertising. Disappointing!
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Nov 17, 2022~Absolutely love this place! I've come here almost everyday for the past 2 years and it never disappoints. Most of the staff have learned my name and gotten to know me, they are all such nice folks. The atmosphere is so calm and welcoming, even when they are super busy. They always get orders out so fast and I've never seen a customer leave unhappy. 10/10 totally recommend this location.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 30, 2018~Finally a Starbucks kinda near the highway on thunderbird! This one has a drive thru. Also there's a patio to sit outside. Nice place and location. They are constructing some other places, near by so this place will definitely be busy! Can't go wrong with a caramel frappacino or white chocolate mocha. Also get the app to order ahead and have your drink ready by the time you get here.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~May 11, 2022~I just moved into the area and was happy to see a Starbucks that was located in the perfect spot. Problem is I would be better off walking into a grocery store to get my coffee in the morning. I think the management team here needs to pick up the pace. I wait 10-15 I'm a line with 4 cars in it every morning. The service here is sub par at best. They need at least 5-6 more employees. I had enough time in line this morning to get upset enough with this service that I had time to write this review. Very disappointed in the performance of the employees here.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jul 11, 2022~Went to the drive thru at Starbucks this morning, if you know me you know I live for caffeine in the morning like a crack addict, it's quite pathetic really  anyway, it was a LONG line..I got to order and the girl interrupted me saying they couldn't take cards, only cash or the app, I didn't have cash and I haven't set up the app so I told her `"that sucks`" in a totally joking way but told her it wasn't her fault and we laughed and that I'd just wait in line.. with jack and Owen in the back..being tHeM  we finally got closer to the window and the last person drove off, as I pulled up the guy stuck his hand out the window and said `"wait!`" I stopped and he said you ordered (my drink) and I said `"oh yeah but I don't..`" he said `"here you go! Shelby got you!`" .. one of the employees bought me a drink it seems like such a small gesture to some maybe but it seriously made me cry  not kidding. Sometimes the smallest acts of kindness can make the BIGGEST impacts and in this case it really did for me...thank you SHELBY!!! A really long post for something soo simple
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 5, 2022~Giselle was absolutely AMAZING!!! My grandma (Karen) and I came in and had a really great convo with Giselle and we wanted to get this other popular drink but we hesitated and she went and made a sample for the each of us to try and now it's our new fall favorite drink  thank you so much for your kindness and just being an awesome person. Amazing customer service on top of everything else. Thank you so much!!!
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Aug 10, 2018~The staff here are super friendly and up beat! I've been waiting a while for this location to open since it's literally walking distance from my house! They have a well oiled machine here! GREAT WORK!
Peoria, AZ 85381~3~Mar 5, 2020~This location is busy busy! We pulled up a little after 11 and the parking lot was packed and the drive through long. This is a busy area next to the freeway, shops, restaurants and Dr offices. For the amount of cars we were helped pretty quickly. Our drinks were made great and we were on our way. Service was ok, but nothing that stands out for me. I'd be back if in the area.
Peoria, AZ 85381~3~Apr 14, 2018~Needed to get some studying done, and this Starbucks has a good amount of seating and convientent outlets to charge my computer. However, I went to get a refill on my iced coffee before I left and removed the lid, handed the barista the cup and scanned my card. After I walked away I saw her throw the cup AWAY and take the next guests order. I was shocked, I thought the whole point about the Starbucks same visit refill was to reuse your cup. I think it's sad that our society-especially Phoenix is so ignorant to plastic waste. I guess forgetting my reusable cups are no longer an option. Good think I saved the lid and straw though. Otherwise this location has good seating and lighting.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jan 19, 2022~This is my go-to Starbucks. 9 times out of 10 my drink is great and the staff is very kind and personable to us! If my drink doesn't taste right, they never hesitate to fix it for me.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Jul 11, 2020~Wow -just wow! I ordered a venti hot americano ....like I do almost every day from this location!!  I'm wearing my mask, I'm following all of the rules but my americano tastes like just water with a hint of coffee! So I go into the store, because I was at the drive thru and I ask them if they can remake my American because it tastes `"mostly like water with just a splash of coffee`" and Jesus, behind the counter says to me, `"but that's what an American is-water and coffee`"!How incredibly rude -what poor customer service! So then I have to further explain that it just tastes bad! He begrudgingly places my redo order and then proceeds to whisper to his teammates how upset I am because my coffee tastes like water instead of coffee!Totally inappropriate! Covid or no covid
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jan 5, 2023~wonderful team and best service! Will always come back!
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Feb 18, 2020~More than a couple employees seem to be in a bad mood. I stood at the counter like an idiot for a while till someone finally took my order. She asked my name, `"Sarah Beth`", then asked `"what's your birth name?`" . WTH? Lol, it's `"Sarah Beth!`" . She put `"Sarah`" on the cup  you know how many white girls named `"Sarah`" order iced coffee.... also, these chairs are stupid uncomfortable.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Sep 17, 2021~I love this specific Starbucks location. The staff are always nice and friendly. My all time favorite drink is the venti Carmel macchiato. The parking could get a little hectic on the weekends. Overall, extremely satisfied.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~May 26, 2023~great staff, very friendly. came in for a iced cold brew and it was perfect didn't have to wait to long!
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Mar 3, 2022~Went to Starbucks in hopes to lift up my already horrible day, when I get there I ordered a chai tea latte and when I got home I look into to cup to reveal a matcha green tea- which made my day even worse thank you Starbucks
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Nov 12, 2020~This is the slowest Starbucks in the history of time. Today in the drive through, they averaged 3-4 minutes per car. 8 cars in line meant we waited almost 30 minutes to get served. We would have left but could not get out of the drive through line. At least a dozen cars behind us, who were not yet trapped in the line, drove away. A man who parked and went in said he waited even longer. The explanation? It's `"holiday season`" (it's November 12), and `"we are, like, understaffed.`"
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Sep 1, 2016~This establishment was clean and well-stocked. I think part of the reason is because they don't have a drive-thru window here. They didn't have a young crowd like some Starbucks, either. Pumpkin Spice latte $4.64. Heavenly. Crowd: 30's. Working professionals. Seating:  comfortable. Variety. Clean: pristine.   Ambiance: sublimeBaristas: well-trained. Personable. Efficient. Decor: balloons added because PSL kickoff. Summary: worth the trip!
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~Dec 11, 2020~We went through the Drive-Thru and it was slow. That's why this isn't a five star review, but service was good and the drinks were great - as usual.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Apr 20, 2021~Great staff ! fast (usually) they always make my drink perfect, and they remember me, always friendly
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Dec 3, 2020~I don't understand how this particular Starbucks consistently have the worst service ever yet still the busiest. Kudos to them for not having to care about good service and still be the busiest Starbucks in the area. My mobile orders are never ready and they don't update the app to what is or isn't in stock. Always have to wait for a mobile order here. Usually they don't start making it until you arrive so they know they have to divert their attention from drive-thru to the mobile order waiting.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Mar 1, 2020~Product constantly shows out of stock or not available on mobile app when they do have it. Especially ice tea!! Frustrating when mobile. I resort going to a doffernConstantly served an ice tea without ice at this store. I get this is a popular thing but if I haven't asked for no ice please make make my ice tea with ice. I do appreciate you can get an ice tea without ice at times. Just need people to pay more attention to the sticker please. Continues to be the slowest Starbuck in the city. Always have to wait for mobile orders no matter how much time you give them. Especially, bakery. They do like to stand around a talk though.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Aug 28, 2019~Product constantly shows out of stock or not available on mobile app when they do have it. Especially ice tea!! Frustrating when mobile. I resort going to a different store. Constantly served an ice tea without ice at this store. I get this is a popular thing but if I haven't asked for no ice please make make my ice tea with ice. I do appreciate you can get an ice tea without ice at times. Just need people to pay more attention to the sticker please.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jan 7, 2021~I never have any issues with this Starbucks and they are always busy so I order ahead on their mobile app. Today, I spaced and placed an order for pick up at the mall where I work rather than this location. When I went in Alexis instantly greeted me and asked if I had a pick up, while she was making someone else's drink for drive thru. When she couldn't find my order I realized my mistake. Without hesitation she said she would make the drinks and that it wasn't a big deal. I apologized and thanked her but she kept telling me it was no problem. She promptly got my order ready. Alexis, you deserve more than a five star review. Thank you for being in the industry of people.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Jul 20, 2018~Second time I order a Drink via Mobile at this location and they fail! Either you guys don't care for the type of milk people specifically order for a PURPOSE!Twice it caused my stomach to hurt for over 2days!
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~May 10, 2020~Placed an order on the app. I put in my email and phone number. It charged my card. I went in to get said order and was told they had no record of the order. I look on the app and it shows no order history. I never got a confirmation email yet my card was charged. Spoke with Jessica who claimed to be a manager. If she is then Starbucks should seriously rethink their qualifications for management as she has no people skills. She tried to tell me that I might have reloaded a Starbucks card that I already told her I did not have. Then she tried to tell me that I might have ordered at another location. Wouldn't my order history show this. She offered to give me one drink. I told her I paid for 3. She said `"I don't know that`" when I clearly showed her my bank account. Tried to call the 800 number and no one answered. Worst Starbucks! Still didn't get my drinks. Luckily I can dispute it with my bank.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 24, 2020~I have truly never had a bad experience here. The workers are all amazing, even as they're probably one of the busiest Starbucks I have ever gone to. Today, I completely messed up my order and even though the line was the longest I've seen, there was zero attitude and they offered to fix my drink even though I was the one who made the mistake. Shelby was quick to help and I really appreciate the customer service. This is my favorite Starbucks to go to!
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Sep 22, 2019~It's new (they moved from the Bashas strip mall at 75th Avenue and T-bird, which was tiny and usually dirty). Barista staff are very friendly here. The building is new and they have a drive-thru window, because I'm too lazy to get out of my car to go inside. I have no complaints about this location. Decent amount of parking. It's next to a car wash.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Jan 11, 2022~Good iced tea but they don't start making it 15-20 minutes after you arrived when you place a mobile order.  They don't practice social distancing here unless you announce it out loud.
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~Apr 16, 2018~This was a more calm Starbucks than I'm used to which made it great to do homework in. There were not too many distractions and my drink and loaf of pumpkin bread were up to my expectations including actually giving me coconut milk instead of trying to pull the wool over my eyes. The staff was kind and conversed more than just taking my order which I prefer but they were not too chatty either! Overall a great experience!
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Dec 29, 2021~I always mobile order and it's never ready on time or wrong. They don't have the mobile order station where customers can grab so you have to wait for an employee to get it for you but they ALWAYS ignore you!!! Given this location multiple chances and it's literally THE worst.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~May 1, 2020~Love coming to this location. The team here makes each day brighter and I love the things they do to engage the customer such as spirit week, Easter egg hunt from the drive-thru, and being kind to even the smallest Starbucks  customer. Thank you for making these last few weeks easier to get through. I know that when I come to this location my coffee will be made right and the team will be kind.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 24, 2020~I love this Starbucks! They also always fast even when there's a long drive thru line. I have been coming here for a year and they are great! I did receive an order once that was wrong but it turned out alright because it was something I ended up liking lol
Peoria, AZ 85381~3~May 25, 2019~So I believe into the Starbucks about maybe four times at most, first few times I went there  the barista's that took care of me were awesome friendly and very personable. Which I appreciate as I know others do as well. Last time I went there of this young woman I think she was a barista, said what can I get for you as she walked by into the back which I thought was odd, you know like don't ask me what you can get for me if you don't have any intention on stopping and helping me would like some respect. So then a nice very nice young lady comes gets my order and I put a few bucks in there tip jar because she was very lovely. And I'm waiting for my coffee, comes up pretty quickly and the woman that gave me my coffee is the reason I will never go back there again.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Jun 2, 2015~A Starbucks is a Starbucks, very turn-key oriented, so really the only thing you can rate and grade is their correctness and customer service.  My girlfriend and I stopped by as we were running errands, while I was in Arizona.  There was no one in line and two people already sitting with their beverages.The staff was polite and courteous, not big on chit-chat or polite conversation.  I decided to pay half with my Starbucks App and half cash, and the cashier looked like she was bothered.  However, you may want to double check your drink order on their ordering system as they got my drink wrong.  Don't get me wrong, but the place was empty so it's not like they were rushing.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Sep 1, 2020~I'm currently sitting in the drive through line at 1130 am with no way out because of a simple request of Cold Brew, that they are out of. The car behind me also wanted to order cold brew. Better preparation for the next day would go a long way.
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~Sep 19, 2019~I went to this Starbucks because my normal one that's closer is being remodeled. I put in my mobile order like I normally do and drove over. This Starbucks does have its own parking lot and the drive thru line sits right in the middle of the parking. There wasn't a line so I parked and went in. I waited a minute or 2 and my order was ready. I walked out to my car and to my horror I was going to be boxed in by the line waiting for the drive thru. Yay. I got in my car and a nice person gave me room to back out. I backed out and was going to pull forward towards the drive thru area and realized there wasn't a way out that way. So...I pulled an Austin Powers move with a giant suv and 46754234 3 point turns in that little parking lot. Was not a great way to start out my morning lol I will return here while my normal SB is being remodeled It lesson learned I will be parking on the west side of Starbucks and not on the east side so I don't get boxed in by the drive thru. I find this is kind of an issue will all the SB but I keep coming back so it doesn't bother me that bad! ;)
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~May 30, 2019~People----it's Starbucks! Yes, you're going to have to wait from time to time. Happy to say I went through the drive thru last week and waited all of 4 minutes for arrival to departure with my fav cold brew. Today, I waited about 15. There was a pretty big inconsistency in my most recent drink, Venti Iced Vanilla Cold Foam cappuccino. Not sure why I've ordered it at least 5 times and it's come out delicious 3 of the 5. Today I went back, and while the wait was pretty long, it's a Saturday. Overall the employees are always friendly, drinks are good and if they're not they always seem willing to offer corrections. I wish there was a little more consistency to my new favorite drink but nothing negative that makes this Starbucks deserve anything less than 5*.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Apr 11, 2021~Went into the store for food. It took them 20 minutes to make one sandwich when they had a separate queue for food. They were unaware that we had placed an order. As we were leaving there was an employee taking orders in the middle of the parking lot and we couldn't get out. We sat with our rear view lights on for 10 minutes and the employee continued to take orders directly behind our car despite seeing us attempting to leave. Horrible drive through and parking lot management and horrible organization of orders.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Jul 14, 2021~This location is the absolute worst. They never have anything in stock yet the app does not reflect that an item is out of stock so you end up ordering it and they tell you they are out of EVERY OTHER OPTION when you arrive. I've had to go back for the rest of my order probably 4 times in the past 2 weeks because they never get it right. Staff doesn't care either, doesn't apologize for the inconvenience as that's the least they can do. This location is an excuse for a Starbucks store.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Dec 19, 2019~I find that they take to long to make a simple cup of watered down hot chocolate milk, and many other drinks. I have gone from one to an other to find that their quality control is so lacking. When I first had a Starbucks drinks it was the same always, but now it no longer has a standard in quality of their drinks. I find each location will vary in the quality of their drinks. I no longer live where I use to, and miss the quality of the drinks that were made there, and do not remember having to wait so long for my drinks close to my place of work, or play. It is now lacking. Now I just go with my friend, and he gets a plane cup of coffee.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Nov 23, 2019~On vacation here in Peoria and have come to this Starbucks 2 days in a row. Have waited over 15 minutes both days. The first day, one drink order was incorrect and a drip coffee was completely forgotten and I had to ask after another 10 minutes of waiting. The second day I came, we waited 20+ minutes for 1 coffee drink! I've been going to SBX for 10+ years and have never waited this long. Need more staff or better trained staff. They didn't even apologize for the wait, incorrect drink or missing drink. We will be driving to another store tomorrow for sure.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Jan 28, 2019~Too slow! Every time I go there they take too long to make a damn ice coffee. There's way too many ppl behind that counter to move so slow. I just go to a Starbucks inside a grocery store because I'll get my coffee no less than a min.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~May 26, 2019~Inefficient, slow, and constantly forgetting my orders. I stopped ordering from them in the morning because my drink is almost never ready on time even when I order 15 minutes ahead, and anytime I order food they forget it altogether. I actually wrote corporate one time because I was so frustrated and it didn't seem to have any effect. I don't know who runs this place, but they need a lot of help. I don't like Dutch bros lines but I'll leave earlier if I can get my coffee without the hassle.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Jul 6, 2019~THIS IS THE 3rd time that my drink has been messed up. A white tea lemonade is NOT a white tea. So when I come here and order that and you literally give me a white tea every single time it gets really frustrating especially when I have to go out of my way and come back to get it fixed. You should seriously change your drive-through person because they obviously are not getting the drinks correct.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Aug 14, 2018~I never go out of my way to say such a thing but I was treated with the upmost disrespect and in-professionalism from `"Kim`" working today at 8:30 VERY RUDE, really management needs tuning and her lack of urgency was pathetic
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Nov 17, 2018~My favorite new Sbux location!!! They put some extra love into their drinks because their creations are always superior than other locations. They're pretty new so they are still a little slow but speed will come with time and experience. Just don't lose the quality, because it is too notch! Happy they're here!
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Apr 2, 2017~So I've been coming to this location multiple times a week for the last 7 years &amp; compared to any other Starbucks I've ever visited, this is the only store I will go to. Every single employee remembers me &amp; my drink and never fails to strike up conversation. They make a customer feel important &amp; cared about. Any time my drinks ever been messed up they willingly fix it without a problem or attitude. I truly enjoy coming in every morning &amp; seeing my favorite baristas. This is the only Starbucks I will go to, period! Going here is always a positive experience! XOXO Aly
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jan 26, 2019~Jessica went the extra mile to help reprint a receipt I had misplaced but needed hours later. She was very friendly and seems to truly love her job and care about the customers. I noticed the other staff members at this location having a friendly and attentive attitude as well.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Nov 24, 2016~Ponytail'd shift supervisor is routinely rude and passive aggressive. Guy blocks off half the lobby 2 hours prior to close saying `"it's off limits`" but really he just doesn't want to clean the area so he can go home early. I asked a barista if the store manager, Tasha, approved of closing off half the lobby and she said she `"had no idea.`" Further, I heard the barista on bar toss nasty remarks back and forth with other partners regarding my order of iced coffee with no ice, as if I had a lot of nerve to order a coffee with no ice when I'm paying for it.Bad service ruins the Starbucks experience even when your drinks taste just fine.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Sep 20, 2020~Horrible service, 10 people working and nobody paying attention to the customers that are in the building.  And the drinks were not made correctly.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jan 1, 2018~Always number one in my book! Great service and wonderful coffee! Sometimes a bit of a line but it moves fast.
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~Oct 16, 2017~Everyone is very friendly, the store is always clean, a little on the slow side, so if you're in a hurry, this is not the place to stop. But if you're meeting for coffee it's a great store!
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jun 24, 2019~This Starbucks is in a really busy area and on a Saturday afternoon you can expect to wait longer than your average weekday. The store did well with the transition from a calmer cafe to busy drive thru. The baristas are SO kind. I have been offered alternate options to drinks and what they recommend multiple times. I have yet to leave this Starbucks without feeling welcome.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Oct 27, 2018~Ordered &amp; paid for a venit triple vanilla, coconut milk frapp and got a grande single shot vanilla cocunut frapp. Waited 15minutes for them to remake it and they forgot to add the extra shot, the guy who made my coffee was so rude when I told him it's wrong and he finally re did it. Lost 25 minutes here for a $7.26 coffee drink. Sucks
Peoria, AZ 85381~3~Apr 9, 2008~I am not a huge Starbucks coffee fan (too bitter for my taste) but I can not deny that I thoroughly enjoy a Venti White Chocolate Iced with 2 extra shots and whipped cream on a hot day.When I'm feeling especially indulgent I'll spring for the Coffee Frapacino.  The heck with the calories!The staff is always warm and friendly with big smiles and a ready welcome.  I get a kick out of listening to the booming barritone voice of the barista.  Don't know his name, but he is young and his voice and personality are that of a much larger guy.  Personality plus.Usually fast, usually accurate.  When they make a boo boo on a drink they give it to ya for free.  Can't knock that kind of service.I love the whole ambience in these coffee houses even if I'm not `"in love`" with their `"straight`" coffee.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Aug 27, 2019~The slowest Starbucks in the universe. I have yet to come and not wait for 15 min in the drive through
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Oct 16, 2014~My favorite Starbucks.. They remember our drinks and start getting them ready when we walk in.. very good service and staff is just great so friendly.. They have comfy chairs inside and a very nice patio outside..
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Sep 28, 2014~We love this location. All employees very friendly. Since we come here so often most of the people know our order so that's really nice.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Feb 12, 2020~Could not have been more pleasant! Very nice employees, great coffee. Too often were quick to complain about poor service, and fail to compliment the good service. Thank you!
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Jan 16, 2020~This is the WORST Starbucks I have ever been too! They are horribly slow and extremely rude! I have never had a good experience there..
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jan 2, 2018~Yum but high prices. I recommend getting the app, it gets you free drinks. They can make your drinks with Coconut milk, and that's good because I'm allergic to dairy.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Dec 23, 2018~Ridiculously long drive thru wait. If someone in the drive thru got the wrong order, it would be courteous to ask them to pull around and wait in a parking space until their drink is re-made. I waited 23 minutes in line with only 3 cars in line cause the person in line had the wrong drink. Please use common sense!
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Mar 1, 2020~I was waiting for a mobile order on a late Sunday for over 25 minutes!!!! Totally ridiculous!!!
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Sep 22, 2017~I've been coming to this Starbucks for quite some time and the staff is awesome. Everyone is very friendly and has a great attitude.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Aug 28, 2018~Definitely my favorite Starbucks to go to! The staff in the evening is always on top of their game. It is always so clean and they are always about the customers. Best customer service ever the whole team work good together always quick and very professional! The only issue I have is the need for more protein boxes but other then that the team is awesome the environment feels like a family and it's always so quick and clean!
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Jul 22, 2014~Starbucks has done 1 thing I'm thankful for. My parents' generation had to deal with cheap diner coffee. Robusto beans which were cheap, high and caffeine, and make awful coffee. Starbucks helped to popularize higher quality beans in this country.That said I am not a fan. I gave up drinking pop 3 years ago. Black coffee is my replacement. That means I need something that has good flavor and is not too bitter. That requires light to medium roast and fresh beans.This location? Or all Starbucks for that matter? Dark roast. Very dark. It is great when you want an espresso drink or something sugary as a desert. But when I just want a plain and tasty coffee in the morning or afternoon? Thanks but most diners these days have better plain coffee.Come here if you want desert or need a pick me up and have no other option. Otherwise, not so much. The staff at this (and most) locations are nice. But it is not quite the experience I remember from even 5-10 years ago.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Sep 1, 2019~The redeeming quality today was how sweet and nice the girl at the drive-through window was. With that being said, today it took legitimately 30 minutes in line to get coffees and once we got to the booth to order, they were out of what seemed like everything. This location needs to get their stuff together. Upper management needs to do a better job of supporting their staff and team members. It was very apparent that the team was under-staffed today.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Jan 7, 2018~Wanted to share a really bad experience that happened at a Starbucks this afternoon around 3:15-3:20. We stopped in at the one at Thunderbird and 75th Avenue in Peoria, AZ. We have visited this location many times and had a positive experience....until now. We placed our order with a very pleasant man. Then we went to end of the counter to wait for our drinks. Aimee was our barista today. Aimee went through the line of cups/orders and with great annoyance says `"really?!!`". I quickly discovered that was my order of a decaf pour over. As she was preparing my coffee she COUGHED over my coffee without bothering to cover! Then enthusiastically continues her conversation with a co-worker about Wednesday night `"ladies night`" at a bar that offer $.50 drinks including well drinks. Then to my horror the co-worker says`" let me know...I want to you to be well`"! AAAAAAGH! She was sick and openly coughed over my pour over while preparing. Needless to say I did NOT drink that coffee. Nor did I want her to make me another.  I dumped it out! When she turned around to the espresso machine to make my husband's drink, she coughed again, but this time into her sleeve. When my husband smiled and thanked her, she grunted in response. Clearly this young woman had no business being at work, as demonstrated in her attitude, actions and health status. You would think someone in the food service/customer service industry would understand ALL health regulations. Just because your back is turned does not mean people do not see you. If we weren't in the middle of a major flu outbreak I would not be so appalled. AZ is one of the very hard hit states! Disappointed, but not really surprised!Thanks for allowing me the `"rant`".
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~Nov 30, 2019~I was there on 2 for 1 and man was it packed! Totally crazy! Although it took forever the guy taking the orders was cool about the situation and made light of the situation.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Feb 18, 2014~Was debating between 1 or 2 stars because my breakfast sandwich and coffee were good, but chose just 1. The other bad reviews on this location are right on par with my complaint. My advice is to go to another location completely. The female cashier I encountered was rude. First, I walked in and looked at the pastries and she said hello 3 times like she was trying to rush me and there wasn't even a line behind me. When I asked if they had a particular sandwich available, she said abruptly said yeah and gave me a snotty look. Then, I gave her my credit card and she snatched it out of my hand. Is customer service just not taught or emphasized anymore these days? Guess not.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jun 19, 2019~I've been going here since they opened this location. They were SUPER slow and inefficient.... fast forward to the past few months and they're amazing. They haven't messed up an order, some times their mobile times are a bit longer but it's expected during their peak hours. I am very impressed. I also go a few times a week.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jun 16, 2015~My favorite Starbucks EVER!!! Amazing, friendly staff... Quick and always on point with correct orders... Love them...
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jul 15, 2016~The express n order by phone and walk right in to pick up your drink is fabulous!  Starbucks may always be  busy to chit chat but they are continuously prompt...polite and the coffee is always ready as well as my order is always right! As much as I hate paying big$ for a coffee ,.. Starbucks sure has made it convenient and tasty... it's a treat that just makes us happy!!!
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~Nov 4, 2015~The holiday drinks are out! Mmmmm I love the Carmel Brule. .. Starbucks still need to personalize the visit more... Employees are so busy.. they forgot to have fun and smile!
Peoria, AZ 85381~3~Jun 26, 2015~Always so busy...no laughing or greeting or smile...very transactional... the coffee is always good at Starbucks, but they lost the happiness!
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Aug 15, 2019~The service was bad my son ordered a moca drink with two extra shots they gave him five was too strong . I ordered Carmel frappe chino with extra Carmel  I got that but the drink didn't taste right tasted bla. So we went back to see if they could fixed it and my son came back and they still got my drink wrong no extra Carmel not good.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Feb 6, 2016~Not the best service here ... Ordered a drink - told them to use coconut milk, it's for a vegan friend. no dairy. It is made with whip cream on top - do the woman scoops most of the whip cream out - dumps some coffee out, adds ice and water and hands it back to me with whip cream globs still in..
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Feb 17, 2016~It's just a normal Starbucks, but steer clear of Betty. She's a real....treat. (Major sarcastic tone on that one.) her name is embroidered on her apron, so apparently the company thinks highly of her, but she's pretty much the equivalent of week old molding coffee grounds.
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~Oct 13, 2016~Just had the Chile mocha. Not bad. Just the right touch of spice. If you like the pumpkin spice give it a try.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jan 27, 2017~I've been into this Starbucks twice for big orders for my work and they have crushed it every time! The three girls that were working today were so amazing and so helpful! Thank you so much!!
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~Jul 17, 2015~I'm positively inclined towards Starbucks, so that must be factored into any review I submit concerning their stores. . . . Like many Starbucks locations, this one has its strengths and weaknesses. I like the interior and there is also outdoor seating on the east side of the store and a few tables outside the main entrance (facing north). This is a Reserve store, which is another plus when I'm in the mood for something off the beaten path. There is no drive-thru, which is not an issue for me. The staff is generally friendly, though my overall impression is that I find more friendly partners at other locations I frequent in the Valley.
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~Nov 20, 2017~Great location to study, staff is always friendly, store is a little slow, but that's expected for a busy coffee joint. I am by no means a `"coffee snob,`" HOWEVER their coffee is horrible. Always has a burnt taste (I say `"always`" based on every coffee order I've placed here--from black, to a latte, to any specialty drink, and anything else in between). On one occasion, I had some coffee grounds in the bottom of my cup.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Jan 2, 2015~I would give negative stars if I could. I went in minutes ago for two White Mochas, ended up asking for my iced one to be remade because it wasn't made right. The girl behind the counter said it was correct, as she made it, but commented that she would make it again. Not 15 seconds later, the exact same coffee that I had just given to her was put in front of me in a different cup. When I took a sip and explain it tasted the exact same and was still not right, the girl said she didn't know what to tell me because it was made properly and proceeded to say what the ingredients were. She then proceeded to ask me what she could possibly `"do to make my drink better`" for me, I told her not to worry about it because obviously the drinks can't be made correctly so I would just get my money back and go somewhere else. Needless to say I won't be back and they obviously need special training at this location (both for drink orders and personality/attitude adjustments)
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Oct 22, 2012~Wow! Service has gotten worse and worse at this location. Last week I had one person in front of me and 15 minutes later was still waiting for our drinks. So, today I order and a new girl is working the reg. never in my life have I had a barrista mess up my drink and then calls me out in front of the whole line to rering me up for the 60cent difference and then continues tell me I ordered it that way. Not only did she get  size wrong but I guess she didnt hear the skinny part either. Anyways, I wonder if that little girl realizes that 60cent rering just cost them about $150/ month in business. Usually, Starbucks has such good customer service, ugh!
Peoria, AZ 85381~2~May 4, 2011~Way too main stream and over-priced. Coffee is not as good as what would be found at a local shop where the employees actually care. Employees were rude and slow, even when there were not many customers waiting.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Feb 1, 2014~This location is slow and can't multitask. I've compained three times to corporate about this location. Keep driving and find a better location.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Dec 25, 2017~Haley K. Was such an awesome barista. She was working her butt off while still smiling and being cheerful. Everyone working here today were doing an amazing job, especially on a day where I'm sure no one wants to be working. Great job ladies. Keep it up.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Dec 19, 2019~Horrible customer service! Lack of leadership and very unorganized. The evening team can't handle a busy crowd. Very disappointing! I went in  to pick up my daughters App order. Today they were having their halt hour and my daughter forgot to include that on her App when she ordered. She asked if when I picked up her order I'd ask them and if she could still get her free drink. I was told no, I'm order to get the free drink, the orders have to be done inside and not on the App. I was a little puzzled because the one in Avondale says you just have to order It on your APP to benefit from the days special. Anyhow, I didn't question him &amp; decided to order the 3rd drink. He took my order then said follow him to that cashier station. There was a line so I got in the back of the line and when it was my turn to pay a new girl came out from the office and decided to take my order. I told her he had my order, she looked annoyed with me and wrung my up. Then she just walked away, not a thank you, didn't ask me my name, didn't place the order wherever it's needed so someone, anyone could begin to make it. I waited 10...15....20 Minutes nothing &amp; they all saw me waiting, all the new customers where ordering and getting their drinks with no issues. I made eye contact with the original barista who was helping me and he asked if I received my order yet. I rod him `"no`" he made a comment to another gal and gentleman who were `"busy`" looking `"busy`" they both new what drink I was waiting for but never made it or looked for it. It's now 30 minutes later, I'm giving them the death stare and still no one is making it. My original barista again asks if I got it and I had to say `"no`" again. During that time a drink appeared from no where, the older gentleman who was told along pride looking busy pointed to a drink, I assumed it was mine, chuckled their was no name on it and shared that one of the issues is she never asked me my name. Again the only classy on in there (the original barista) apologized and as I was walking out the girl was making another surprise visit and she looked at me odd as if she was wondering why I was still there and she must of been told something because she looked at me scared and I said. `"You never asked me my name nor ordered my drink ever`" with a smirk she said `"oh, sorry`" and I said `"I'm sorry too`" never again! I'm not done sharing with everybody how horrible this place is.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~Feb 10, 2015~The unenthusiastic Rachel needs to be canned. I met up with my friend there one day and before I could say anything he said exactly what I was thinking. `"this is the worst Starbucks ever! `" he went on to tell me how when he ordered she was very rude to him. When she took his order, she did not even look up to greet him. When he completed his order, she rudely and shortly asked him what his name. I read a book about how Starbucks build its success on great customer service, it is hard to believe that they are still following this tradition by still employing rude people like Rachel.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~May 7, 2017~Not customer friendly. The girl at the register should not have been up there. I understand that everyone is initialed to have bad days at work but if you are that miserable go take a break or change with another girl. Don't roll your eyes at the customers.
Peoria, AZ 85381~1~May 7, 2017~My wife and I stopped here this morning. She ordered a drink and I handed the girl behind the counter a $50 bill. That is all I had. Her and the manager both said they don't have change for a $50 and said I needed to pay with a card or smaller bill. When I told them this is all I have they said they can not make the drink for my wife then. Out of 2 cash registers neither apparently had enough to give change for $50. I said this is fucking bullshit and we walked out. How does a company expect to run if they can't have change for cash? We will never go back.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jan 21, 2015~The Starbucks is always very busy but the baristas are so fast that it doesn't matter they always do a good job on the coffee
Peoria, AZ 85381~4~May 27, 2017~The staff here make my order 2 times wrong but they gave me those 2 cups of frapp free so it's ok :))
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jan 14, 2017~Great place great food usually very crowded because all the locals know this the place to go they got their morning Java. Typical Starbucks great place to meet people can get a quick bite and something to drink.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Sep 8, 2014~This location has the clover brewing system,  which makes excellent coffee!   Awesome that you can get any of the coffees they have made fresh instead of settling for whatever their selection is for the day.
Peoria, AZ 85381~5~Jun 22, 2016~Been coming to this location for a while.  Staff is always friendly. Special thanks to Kari. She always has a smile and sometimes has my beverage ready before I hit the cashier. Your company is very fortunate to have her. Thank you.
Peoria, AZ 85383~3~Oct 15, 2024~Friendly baristas, spacious seating, and delicious coffee and tea, although they don't give you a free or discounted refill on Passion Fruit and Strawberry Acai iced teas which is a bummer
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Dec 8, 2024~Horrible baristas that have an attitude. They made my drink wrong and instead of remaking it they had an attitude about it and wouldn't remake it. I payed 8 dollars to not even get what i wanted. They need to learn to work in customer service.
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Jul 26, 2024~Rude staff, I travel the country with my dog and one of the reasons I go to Starbucks is their welcoming environment for service animals and all animals. This is the first Starbucks I have ever walked into where the first words out of their mouth was not good morning or hello but `"is that a service animal?`". I have been to this Starbucks half a dozen times and never been asked that. The girl with the yellow flower in her hair, you are a rude person.
Peoria, AZ 85383~4~Nov 19, 2022~What can I say about Starbucks, there's nothing more to that is just a chain coffee. But, what makes this location awesome!! its the Arizona landscape view, something you expect to see in the Arizona dessert but more modernize it's. The inside v8ew it has a great relaxing modernized design.
Peoria, AZ 85383~2~Oct 16, 2023~Not the friendliest staff. Surprising for a Starbucks, you expect them to be the example in friendly. Not this location.
Peoria, AZ 85383~2~May 28, 2024~Slowest Starbucks ever. Always. They also like to randomly close early and close drive through at times. Usually when they do that and you go inside you're greeted by the disgruntled male employee who complains out loud in front of customers. Been this way for at least a year.
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~May 21, 2024~I always ask for extra caramel in my drink, and I need everyone to know: they understood the mission . the drive thru workers are always the sweetest people too, they absolutely know how to do their job
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Feb 7, 2023~Wow. I can see why this one has low reviews.  I used to like it before it reopened. But today I got told that they could not follow the apps instructions on how it make my drink. What???  This manager Sarah even validated this. I called corporate to complain. I have never had any issues with any other store following my chai tea bag drink instruction order. Either the app needs to be updated or they need to comply. Horrible experience today!  I should not have to go out of my way due to this particular store not agreeing with the app and giving a generic analogy of why. I hope that this can be resolved through corporate. Although I am not sure if I would even want to go back to this morning crew.  The other crew was great, no issues; This new crew not so much.
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~Nov 11, 2023~Thank you Starbucks and Starbucks Family for the appreciation that you're showing veterans. You don't have to do this but you do and we greatly appreciate it.  Garrett was very appreciative of my service, and I appreciate him taking the extra time to give me that compliment.  Jim &amp; Zaldy
Peoria, AZ 85383~4~Aug 29, 2022~This is your typical Starbucks and if you order online then you can gain rewards and pick up in the store
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Oct 11, 2022~I order on the mobile app to be able to run inside and grab my drink and my breakfast while I'm heading into work. I do it because I have to drive 40 minutes to work so I have something to drink on my way and a sandwich to eat when I get to work. The whole point of ordering on the mobile app is to have it ready so I can walk in grab it and walk out why is it that this is the only store that waits until you get there to heat up the sandwich. Twice now I've had to walk out of the store without my food and without a refund. Technically this will be the third time because there was one time when I went in to pick up my drink and there was no sandwich and they told me that there was no order for a sandwich even though it was on my app I paid for it. People that work here are incompetent.
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Dec 4, 2023~The girl working the drive threw was rude. I think har name was Sam and had brown hair. But either way she was unpleasant, annoyed and deffinatly didn't want to be there. Also my drink didn't taste right and on the sticker was wrong but also tasted weird . I went to the one on Lake plesent to get it fixed. This was the second day in a row I was at 67th and my drink tasted gross . I'll just drive the extra mile and go to Lake plesent from now on.
Peoria, AZ 85383~4~Oct 7, 2023~I'm at the Starbucks 3 to 4 times a week consistently good fast service go to drive through all the time I just can't understand why this different person in the window every day
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Aug 8, 2023~I think I'm done with Starbucks for a while.   Went to this location on 8/7/23 around 2:45 pm.  The girl who took my order was rude to me for no reason.   Beginning with the first item I ordered she said `"is that it?`" And proceeded to say that after each subsequent item I ordered.   Especially because the first item I ordered was a cake pop.  What percentage of customers come there for a cake pop only, and no drink order?    She was being impatient from the get go for no reason at all.  There was no car in front of me or behind me.   She tells me `"got it.   Pull up to the window.`"  When I got up there I paid and then she handed me my items without saying a word.  I'm tired of paying to be treated like crap at places.     I'm going to explore some smaller chains or a mom-and-pop coffee shop, because there are a lot of them.    Sick and tired of people lashing out at others.  And the pricing isn't even reasonable.    I'm done.
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~Nov 8, 2020~Been hitting this bucks on the weekends for several months since moving.  Staff is A+ and the team is quick and auper well oiled machine.  Don't have delays,Slow orders, lost orders, etc.  Super clean in and out...
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~Aug 24, 2023~This is my go to location, I'm very picky about my coffee and I always customize it then place it online. When I come in the employees are always friendly, my coffee is always just as expected and time appropriate. Location is always properly maintained and stocked up in the cooler and shelves!
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Feb 16, 2023~Yet another bad experience here at this location! What's going on? I had the same experience as Yvonne G with the manager Sarah. I asked for a little extra milk in my drink and she said she can't or would have to charge me extra for milk! They used to have pitchers of milk, cream or half and half for their customers and now they want to charge to add a little milk to my coffee drink? Normally ANY place that serves coffee gives you milk/creamer to add for NO charge! Ridiculous! And Sarah finally decided to unwillingly give me some and it was literally a teaspoon in a cup! Rude. This is not my normal starbucks and probably won't be back. Tired of this locations terrible customer service. Especially when paying $6 for a drink!
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Jul 23, 2022~Same experience as Brianna T and in addition, baristas messing up orders, not reading the mobile order ingredients, and having attitudes. So sad because this used to be the best Starbucks and now it's the worst!
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~Jul 22, 2021~So awesome! So I ordered ahead and showed up- after waiting a while they asked my name and didn't have an order for me. Well... my dumbass ordered from the wrong location and I would have to drive an extra 20+ minutes round trip to go to the right store. Before I could walk out the manager (I assumed- she was very confident and professional so I assume) she stopped me and offered to make my drink. I tried to pay and she wouldn't have it. Way to hold up the Starbucks brand and culture. This is why Starbucks has my loyalty!
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~Nov 18, 2018~So happy this Starbucks location has opened. Outdoor seating area and workspace inside. The drive thru is super convenient for me before work and mornings when I just wanna make a morning coffee run with the kids. Staff is helpful and friendly.
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~Jun 18, 2020~This is my hands down favorite location!! But before I get into it I wish I could respond to other reviews.. someone said they have been coming to this location for SEVERAL years but this location hasn't been open for that long soooo I'm confused. Another review says they won't split a drink into 2 cups which is technically the way all Starbucks should be doing it (I use to work for the one off of Lake pleasant and happy valley) it is a pain because I have 2 little ones too but you cannot expect them to not follow their guidelines at work unless you are prepared to pay them if they lose their job because they didn't follow rules ijs.But any who the meat and potatoes of this review here it is. They are simply the best!! They take the time and effort to know who you are by name and remember your drink or drinks as a regular (and no that is not their job as a barista) that is because they are awesome people!! If they make a mistake they gladly fix it quickly I have had a drink made and shots have been dead or to much milk and they never have had an attitude remaking it or anything always very kind and helpful. The drive thru line can get a little ridiculous but that's because everyone knows it's the best one and they start coming to this location!!
Peoria, AZ 85383~2~Dec 25, 2019~Been coming to this location for several of years. This past year the drink that I order every single day is inconsistent. Seems like only certain workers their know how to make it. Did a mobile order this morning and my drink was nasty and I almost spit it out. The guy made eye contact with me and then turned his head so that he didn't have to deal with me. I then went to the register to explain that my drink was nasty. She asked the same guy who looked away to make my drink again. Still tasted disgusting. I ended up paying $5.95 for a drink that I never drank. I wonder if the workers ever actually samplethe drinks the make? I seriously felt like asking them  to taste the drink that they made because then they would understand. So frustrating!!
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Nov 20, 2022~Most hap hazard location ever been to. Messed up a lot of drinks, had to return to remake. It was too sweet the 2nd time around, had no time to waste on going back again. Trash bins were over flowing, dirty restrooms and just not very hygienic clean feel at this location. Way too many baristas but way too messed up service and drinks for mobile orders piling up with no clue of what's going on here. Manager not to be seen showing any leadership to improve upon anything.
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~May 28, 2022~Went in for a remake of a drink that was previously made incorrectly. Watched the barista make the order wrong AGAIN and when a different barista handed me my drink, I let her know I watched it being made wrong. She got a major attitude about it and said she made the drink, which she absolutely did not. She refused to remake it. I left really irritated and called the manager about it. She was also insanely rude and told me I can take it to another Starbucks for a remake. How hard is it to read labels ladies? If it were a busy day, that would be one thing and I'd understand but I was one of two people inside and there were very few cars in the drive thru. Also, if you can't be polite, perhaps customer service isn't the right job for you.
Peoria, AZ 85383~2~Sep 9, 2019~I like this location because they're faster then one close to me, and they have nitro cold brew. Once in a while when I come here though, they won't split a vanilla bean into two cups. My kids don't ever finish a whole one and it's difficult to split it into the cups in the car :( It also wastes the the original cup it came in. Killing the environment and the spirits of parents all over Peoria over here.
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~Oct 27, 2022~Starbucks is amazing. All the drinks are absolutely delicious even if you want just a quick coffee they're perfect.10/10 would recommend
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Dec 5, 2020~Not my best experience. If you have a new hire do proper training on taking orders. Not the employee fault he doesn't know how to use the POS system properly.  When you see someone struggling. Step in and help out. Management be aware and step up to the plate.
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Aug 27, 2022~this place always out of what i want.  like cream cheese cmon how are you out of CREAM CHEESE? manager need to do inventory more often
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Jan 13, 2020~Used to come here to study all the time last semester. It was nice and chill. However, coming back this semester I left the place with a headache. The baristas are obnoxious!! They were laughing and screaming on the top of their lungs. It was so disturbing! I had a hard time focusing. They were extremely loud and unprofessional. I'm not sure if they hired a bunch of new people but they should not put them all together because they are way too loud. People come here to study but can't do that when all the baristas are yelling and screaming. No one is here to hear their personal conversations. Will not be coming back for sure. Many people seemed annoyed and unhappy. Customers kept looking at them but they didn't seem to care and continued to be loud. Having conversations with ur coworkers is totally fine but when you cause people to get up and leave due to you screaming is not acceptable.
Peoria, AZ 85383~2~Aug 14, 2019~This is the nosiest coffee shop that I have been to. The staff slams things around and screams at each other and screams the names of customers orders as the drinks are made. I've waited for service as the staff stood at the drive through adoring someone's dog. So now I spend less at Starbucks.
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~Oct 10, 2019~Great customer service, good location and the drive thru at this location is so fast! Never had to wait very long in the drive thru. Inside is clean and just as fast.
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~Aug 27, 2021~This is an amazing Starbucks location. The staff is very respectful and the best customer service. The orders get taken fast and the drive through wait just depends on how many cars are there. The best part is the food and it's always fresh with no issues!!
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~Sep 25, 2019~What a great Starbucks!! Super convenient location and all the employees are really friendly and kind! The inside is also really nice, it could be a little cleaner, but still nice and spacious!
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~May 24, 2019~What can I say? I know what I am going to get and being a simple dark coffee drinker, they are good and consistent. Dark roast or Americano it is good and come the holidays the Christmas blend is AMAZING!!!
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Jan 25, 2020~Service was terrible.  Stood at the register waiting to order for 5 min.  For the first three, not a single worker acknowledged me more than a glance when walking past.  Then an acknowledgement saying I'll be right there and after two more min and no additional eye contact I left. I was the only person at the register...
Peoria, AZ 85383~2~Feb 6, 2019~I work in the area and was thrilled when the new store opened (my office is full of coffee lovers).  I've been to this specific location a couple of times now, over the last few months, and every single time I go, they get the order wrong.  This last time I went, I actually went inside the store, rather than the drive thru, ordered a coffee and a slice of lemon loaf and unfortunately, once again, the coffee was wrong and they gave me banana nut bread instead.  Sorry, but I will now be driving back to the original store that I've always gone to, even through it is completely out of the way, but they at least get my order correct without me having to make another trip back to get it corrected.
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Mar 4, 2020~Night staff standing around chatting have a good time while outreach drink sat on the counter. Waived...honked.. nothing. Service was also super slow.
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~Feb 8, 2020~I generally only use their drive thru, and the service is top notch. Employees are always friendly and courteous, and the wait is never too long. I've been inside the location on only one occasion, and while it was busy, it didn't take too long for my order since I used the Starbucks app. This is my go-to place, highly recommend.
Peoria, AZ 85383~5~Apr 10, 2019~Great customer service, good location. Bathrooms are usually clean, at least what I've witnessed. The ambience is nice and there is an outdoor sitting, plus a drive-thru
Peoria, AZ 85383~1~Aug 11, 2019~Usually great service.... until I got charged 5 dollars for a cup of ice. Not a happy camper.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Dec 1, 2023~This is still my go-to Starbucks in Phoenix.I will drive past other Starbucks store to get to this one.Why? Because it has a great patio and view of the surrounding preserve just north of the restaurant.And the coffee is always good. And they still have a Clover machine.Parking can be a challenge on Saturday mornings but there are at least 100 spaces within 100 yards.The baristas are always friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Apr 5, 2015~This Starbucks is perfectly located between the Arizona Biltmore area and the walking trails of the Phoenix Mountains Preserve.The only negative to this location is the dearth of parking. There are a few (about 15) good spots but the rest of the parking area may require a walk of up to 100 meters.The actual restaurant is very inviting with outside seating in two patio areas that are on two sides of the store.The coffee baristas all seem very knowledgeable and I have seen some of the same baristas for almost a year.This is one of the growing number of Starbucks stores with a Clover machine. There is therefore a large variety of quality coffees and unique blends from which to choose if you want to try a clover-brewed coffee.The latte that I ordered was just as I expected-delightful. I also ordered a turkey pesto panini which was very tasty. I wanted one of the new wraps, but they had already sold out-bummer.Overall, an excellent Starbucks experience, as usual.

Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 30, 2014~Decided to try this Starbucks as it has a Clover machine. Had a Komodo Dragon and it was very flavorful. Everything about this Starbucks is up to the usual high standards. Not the most parking-friendly location, but there is ample parking if you are willing to walk 50 meters or so. Nice friendly baristas. Lots of sitting space.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Feb 4, 2022~After a hike at Piestewa Peak I needed a little pick me up so I stopped here for some coffee. This location does not offer a drive thru and their indoor seating is currently closed but you can still walk in and order something to drink and sip it on their outdoor patio or get it to go. I originally wanted the chestnut latte but they were all out of the syrup so I went with what the large ostentatious sign behind the cashier advertised, PISTACHIO LATTE! The cashier emphatically said it was delicious so that solidified my decision. It was made quickly and off I went!The latte was indeed pretty tasty! I could taste the nutty pistachio flavor and it had a balanced amount of sweetness.Details:- Staff wear masks- Masks recommended inside- Indoor seating temporarily closed- Outdoor seating available
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Aug 24, 2024~Make sure to tip big. Otherwise, the heavy set guy will hide your drink and make sure to not call your name so you site for 10 minutes before realizing... Only 2 of us waiting. Very clearly called name for other customer. Nobody else in store.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 17, 2021~Location! Location! Location!I think I'm qualified to sell multimillion dollar real estate now.This Starbucks may be a top 10 location in the USA, maybe the planet, along with the one in Sedona. It faces the gorgeous Phoenix Mountain Preserve Park; where I had a great time hiking and admiring the huge cacti and desert after my coffee. Then I returned to rehydrate. It's right across the street from the hiking trailhead.Note: Remember to be nice....if you're going on a hike, Park at the trailhead lot not the shopping center lot. Service by Barista Taylor was outstanding.There is plenty of room and a nice outdoor lounge in the back and a lot of shopping center parking.Top ten Starbucks in Arizona.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 12, 2021~I love this starbucks in particular. I mean all the starbucks staff are friendly but this location has the beststaff over the past 2-3 years I have been in! they are always friendly, kind, accommodating, and greet you with the biggest smile. I wish the parkinglot was a little bigger but most of the time I visit, I don't have an issue finding a spot nearby. Definitely my all time favorite starbucks! I always walk out of the store with a smile!! Thank you for being kind, and attentive to all the staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Dec 22, 2023~typically good and no problems, forgot bacon and the `"bacon egg gouda`" no refund options on the starbucks app.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 8, 2023~I come here twice a week so my son can do tutoring. It is amazing. All of the staff is amazing.   Jorge and another young man who is there Mondays and Tuesdays are especially amazing (he has told me his name but I am drawing a blank at the moment) they are always so kind and rember our drinks everytime. Being a bartender it makes me feel great when I am remberd. I usually don't get coffee often but I will always come here (even though one is located across the street from me) the staff is amazing and makes me and my son always feel welcome. So thumbs up to all the staff for being awsome
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 18, 2023~Service was great. she helped me with my bonus stars and was very patient. I had a Macha green tea latte and it was perfect. THANK YOU for not taking a stand on politicizing in celebrating and decorating for a month for something that is a sexual choice.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jan 8, 2022~What can you say about Starbuck's. Sometimes the experience is good, other times it's AWESOME!! This STARBUCK's is AWESOME!!! I am really particular about my Frappuccino being made just right, not having the left over drink be poured down the drains, and this location stepped up and made me feel very special during my 12 days of dog sitting in the area.Ethan, Melissa, and the rest of the team, thank you for making me feel loved during Christmas &amp; New Year's. I appreciate your attentiveness, clean store, bring cheery attitudes and most of all a properly made drink &amp; great Banana, Walnut Bread Loaf (or whatever it's named this week!!) :-)  Keep up the great work here. Maybe one day I'll see you all again.Michael Murdock, US NAVY VETERAN
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 1, 2019~A lot of people have a personal Starbucks, where the cashiers know their name and often their drink before they even order.I'm not a frequent enough customer to be recognizable here, but this is my personal Starbucks.  It's also become the personal Starbucks of my mom and stepdad, neither of whom actually live in Phoenix.  Whenever they come to town to visit, they visit this Starbucks on a daily basis.  It's not just because it's the closest to my house.  They've tried most of the coffee shops in a 30 minute drive from my place (okay, it's possible they have a bit of a caffeine problem).  It's because they like the people, the atmosphere, and, of course, the coffee.One of the cool things about this location is the dog spa and vet next door.  Hear me out.  You can sit outside on the patio next to the misters on a warm day and watch super cute puppies come in and out of the attached shops.  And, when you leave, you can look up at Piestawa Peak above you.  It's almost like walking your dog and hiking but without any of the necessary willpower or energy.  Great, right?Anyway, this Starbucks is quite a step up from the typical downtown Starbucks.  Give it a try!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Nov 15, 2019~What's great about this Starbucks is it is right across the street from the Phoenix Mountain Preserve! So you can hike several miles, then come here to rest and relax with friends while getting hydrated and having snacks!It's a bit on the smaller side for a Starbucks so I would socialize here or read, but wouldn't bring a laptop to work or study. Clean bathrooms. Great location.  A win!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 10, 2021~Jade and her team in the morning are the BEST! Going there is the perfect way to start any day. I often notice the team memorizes everyone's names, and remember orders too! This location makes Starbucks feel like home. If you're ever in a bad mood, go to this Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Mar 9, 2020~This is a very nice location. The woman taking orders was so friendly! The only bummer was there seemed to be a shortage of staff. The baristas were working as quickly as they could, however they seemed quite backed up. I waited about 15 minutes for my drink after ordering, not terrible, but I've had better experiences!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 16, 2022~A standout Starbucks in the Phx area! Really cool view of the mountains, depending on where you're sitting in the seating area. Drink is always out quick, especially with mobile orders. Staff has always been super friendly and helpful. Truly feels like a coffee shop where I can sit and read/work/chill, some other locations in the area it feels not as welcome. Always a great vibe here!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 20, 2017~My all time favorite Starbucks location in Phoenix. I literally came here for 3-4 months straight to study for an exam. I practically lived here! The staff is always so sweet and welcoming (shoutout to Avery and Kyle!) and this location is always spotless. Moreover, this place is especially wonderful because it's got a spectacular view. I always love watching the sunset here!Parking has never personally been an issue for me, but the immediate surrounding parking lot is pretty small. However, there is a ton of parking for all of the other buildings nearby -- which, yes, might be a little dreadful in the Phoenix heat, but honestly, it's totally worth it.If I'm not at home, the gym or Sprouts, 9 times out of 10, I'm most likely here.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Apr 5, 2015~Five reasons for a 5 star rating:1. The view, seriously, the VIEW. Sit facing north if you have no clue or if you typically ignore the beauty of the desert, take some time enjoying the spectacular view.2. Location.  My favorite Starbucks and the closest to home when we are here. 3. Parking. There is plenty of it, just some tough spots on the north side of the store. There is a reason that they have a big red steel barrier around the store on the north and part of the east side. I have seen some drivers backing out their cars from the slots on the north and they most likely have red paint on their bumpers.4. Plenty of seating, inside and out, with comfortable temperature inside whether it's February, April or August.5. Drinks are served up with efficiency and a great attitude by the baristas. They also have a Clover machine, and it appears low barista turnover exists here, too.Thanks, Starbucks, for a great location.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 27, 2017~This one is busy in the mornings but fast and I love Starbucks. Order with the app to skip the line!Parking here is pretty tricky the spaces on the side are tiny and hard to get out of.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Nov 14, 2019~Took them over 15 minutes to make my mobile order, which was a tall pumpkin cream cold brew (pretty simple) What is the point of me placing a mobile order ahead of time just to have to wait and extended period of time? Inconvenient.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 3, 2020~My Almond Milk, Dirty Chai was made perfectly. I'm completely happy and my thirst is quenched.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Mar 12, 2016~Are you KIDDING me? I order an extra hot 2 pump Classic latte (see image) and I get a latte with Chai flavoring instead??? The handwriting for the Order, in my opinion, is clear, you be the judge...At least service was fast. The woman who took my order was nice but the blonde 30-40 y/o with the ponytail making my coffee....shame on you.I have been a Gold member since 2013 and Never in Many states, innumerable different locations have I ever experienced this faux pas. Can I have my $4.51 back? I can respect a mistake but not something that is utterly disgusting. *******Received this Response from Starbucks******** Hi Leah, Thank you for contacting Starbucks.

Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jun 8, 2018~I am only writing three three stars instead of one because I'm feeling generous. I was looking to get some coffee before I headed into work early and there are not many Starbucks that are open this early so I planned my trip strategically by putting this Starbucks in my path. Google shows 4am is the open time, the door shows 4:30 and yet even at 4:42, they were not open and i could see them still setting up the display case etc. I know it's something trivial but hey, can you guys update your hours across the board and then actually open on time? Thanks!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jun 7, 2018~Great location here in Scottsdale. Easy to get in and out for parking. This Starbucks is clean and the Staff is very attentive. My mobile order was ready in about 4-5 minutes so thanks to the Barista!!  I have bookmarked this location so I know which location to frequent when I am back in Scottsdale!!  Thanks
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 25, 2018~The Starbucks is always super quick with my mobile order. The store is always clean and busy. I've done homework here on the weekend and it wasn't too distracting. It's a nice view of the mountains while you're inside.The only thing that I dislike about this location is the parking situation. There is never any parking in the morning to run in and get your coffee. If you don't want to waste time finding a spot, park in the shopping center and walk over.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Aug 3, 2014~I just loved this little Starbucks on the Southwest corner of E Lincoln and N. 32nd in Phoenix.  The building is large with a very spacious feeling inside. There are large window everywhere providing plenty of natural light. There is quite a bit of seating at small wooden tables and even one large one.  This is a much larger Starbucks than I am used to seeing back in California.   The baristas are quite friendly, calling out a cheery hello as you enter.  There is a gentle hubbub of conversations in different languages taking place all around you giving this unassuming little coffee shop a very cosmopolitan feel.  Blues music plays softly in the background adding to (not detracting from) the happening vibe of this place.And, of course, there is the free wifi which Starbucks is known for.  We were staying at the JW Marriott Scottsdale Camelback Inn down the street and had a very difficult time getting good reception for our wifi hotspots necessitating numerous trips to this particular location to use their wifi - and, of course - indulging in their sinfully good expresso beverages.  Over my several visits here I have ordered both hot beverages (venti skinny cinnamon dolce latte) and cold beverages (iced green tea) and they were all tasty.The parking seems to be a little tight at peak hours, but otherwise this is a fabulous location.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 1, 2014~I love this place so much!!! Amazing location, incredible views, and the staff is at the highest of customer service standards. They remember the regulars, they're  all very light hearted and great at making our drinks!!! They have the new Clover, and Fizzio!!! They are amazing!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Dec 10, 2017~It is hard to differentiate one Starbucks from another. That said they're generally of very good quality and very responsive to specific request of the customer, something that more local coffee shops should embrace. I love a nice hearty cup of coffee and when I told the barrister that today Tana made sure that she not only made me a nice strong cup of coffee, but gave me the specifics of what my coffee blend was and how much she used. That is going above and beyond!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Mar 2, 2012~This is the former location of the Russ Lyon Realty office that was at N. 32nd St &amp; E. Lincoln Dr near the 32nd St. Trailhead.  Starbucks just opened this morning and I happened to be driving by.  The staff is friendly and apparently the whole crew from a North Scottsdale store moved down to this spot to open it. ( A guy that lives in Scottsdale and works down the road from here said that it was really cool, and odd.  Kind of like deja vu for him.)There is a small patio of to the side with tables, chairs, and a misting system.  Located right beside the newly moved Squaw Peak Animal Hospital, this Starbucks is sure to attract a hiking and dog-friendly crowd.  Parking will be challenging, there isn't a drive-thru and the cool patio is off the side, somewhat oddly oriented.I would visit this plaza often when At One Yoga was still in operation (if they had known that Starbucks was moving in, maybe they wouldn't have closed shop?)
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 8, 2017~The 2 amazing girls working today fucking rocked it! It was busy as hell, temporarily broken machine, and full of rude ass people not being patient and understanding.  These girls rocked it and got it done!! All our drinks were made to perfection! We made sure to leave them a big tip!!   Best Starbucks ever!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 23, 2019~Other than the fact they used dark chocolate instead milk chocolate, they didn't even mix my drink! It's like they just threw in the ingredients and called it done.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Apr 21, 2019~It took over 30 minutes for the Barista to make my mobile order... AND IT WASNT EVEN CORRECT!! I arrived about 10 min after placing my mobile order in the app, &amp; my mobile order wasn't ready yet.. so I ordered a drink in store for my boyfriend while waiting.. His order was ready &amp; wasn't correct AND my mobile order was still not ready... it's been about 20 min since I've placed my mobile order now..The barista, Candice, was not at all accommodating &amp; seemed annoyed to have to talk to me about my mobile order that still hasn't come out after 20 min &amp; frustrated to make a 'new' one ... ?? The Barista made an americano but failed to acknowledge ANYTHING on my order besides that it was an americano... I had ordered a BLONDE americano w/ 4 total expresso shots &amp; 2 pumps mocha sauce She made a regular americano .. and when I asked her if there was at-least 4 shots in the drink .. she responded rudely with `"well did you order 4 shots bc I only put 3`" and I said `"yes I order 4 shots`" (which if she looked at the receipt I showed her on my phone she would have known...) and she responded back `"well if you payed for them then I'll make you an extra shot on the side`" ... So after waiting 30+ MINUTES  for a MOBILE ORDER! I didn't even get the correct order!!I ordered a BLONDE americano with 4 SHOTS &amp; 2 pumps Mocha I ended up with a REGULAR AMERICANO (black) &amp; a expresso shot on THE SIDE!! As well as nothing but rude and annoyed service by the staff... I love the location of this Starbucks but the service here is the worst I've ever experienced time and time again when I come to this locationDon't come here unless you have time &amp; patience to wait for your order AND might not even get the correct order in the end... just be grateful you get coffee... Unfortunately this happens at least 1 out of every 3 times I've placed an mobile order at this store ... this was by far the worst though!! &amp; on Easter Sunday ...
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Apr 4, 2019~Please review security footage 12:30-12:40, April 4, 2019. Employee stole $5. $3 was to be my change, $2 destined for the till. Receipt not given. Two venti redeye's cost me $12.71 before my order was handed over.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Mar 2, 2021~So I've been going to this Starbucks for maybe 2 years now off and on and they are probably the slowest Starbucks I've ever been to. Whether it's a mobile order or an order at the counter it seems like I always have to wait 7-8 minutes. The baristas are always sweet but it always shocks me how it is is still so slow even after a year or two.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jan 17, 2016~Since I'm not a coffee drinker, very rarely do I frequent a Starbucks. However, with reliably tasty hot chocolate and somewhat reliably friendly staff, this place makes for a cozy place on a chilly day. Views of Squaw Peak and Camelback Mountain give quite the ambience, and the majority of the local patrons are polite and quiet. I'll also use this location to bring my laptop to get some work done and to meet up with friends coming out from the north or west valley areas to do things further east since it's right off the 51.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Nov 15, 2014~Now this is a Starbucks that wants people to hang out a while and endlessly refill their Bold Roast.  Plenty of windows keep it bright and sunny, there are more than enough tables and comfy chairs to satisfy the `"talk over coffee`" types and those who like the vibe of a coffee shop to get work done.  Service is super fast, and I won't even hold it against them that they spelled my name Aaren.  (Erin is the typical female, Irish spelling.  Aaron is for boys.  Eryn, Aryn, Airen, etc are usually girls with eclectic parents.  Aaren is new.)This shop is super close to Piestewa, but they ask that you don't park here while you're hiking.  Perhaps  a post-hike energizer?
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Apr 7, 2013~One of my fav Starbucks! Cant beat the location-- looking at Squaw Peak mountains is awesome.   Lots of seating and nice set up inside store.  Friendly customer service from all staff. I drink tons of coffee -many of them  free refills because of my gold card status and they never make me feel guilty or bad.   I highly recommend checking out this location when you want good coffee in a pretty atmosphere.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Nov 14, 2012~Great beverages, and incredible service:). The Manager of this unit was awesome.  Very personable, with sincere and authentic care and concern for her guests.  Motivated me to create this account and write a review:)
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Dec 26, 2016~Have frequented several Starbucks locations in the area and would probably say this is the best.   Baristas are consistently pleasant and service is fast.  Lots of tables inside and a great spot to hang out or get a few hours of work done.  Also, the mountain views are fantastic.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Dec 5, 2014~It's a Starbucks so if you have a been to one you know exactly what to expect. Folks that work here are pretty coo. They have plenty of seating, plus a really great outdoor seating section. Although you can't see the views from the outside, you're right at the base of the Phoenix mountain preserve.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Mar 7, 2017~Best and fastest service at any Starbucks I have ever been at in the country.  Way above and beyond.  Thanks
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Dec 18, 2016~Pretty standard Starbucks place. Great late hours. They even do mobile orders. One of the ladies made it extra hot just incase it was sitting out too long before I got there. It was perfect!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Nov 4, 2016~Clover machine coffee is the best. Seriously, I try to stay away from SB and help out the little guys and roasters but it's a cool process and the quality of the bean is great. I paid $3.50 vs $2.50 for their moral brew, so worth it...
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Mar 28, 2016~Starbucks - unless you live on Mars or potential you're a cannibal in South America you know what this place is. The only thing keeping Starbucks from 5 stars is pricing. Everything's uniform - comfortability.... Employees are friendly and typically pretty cheerful. Dropped in to get one of those cherry blossom Frapuccino's that is no longer available and of course they McGyver A concoction together that is an end result exactly the same to your taste buds just not as visually appealing, lol. Thanks to Starbucks I get to start my day with a little Frapuccino fun!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 31, 2017~Worst experience at Starbucks so far. Went in for a tea and a water and a lady with short blonde hair was just talking away with another employee whom came in after me. She proceeded to make her drink before mine. Take care of your guests first. 15 minutes later; I got my drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Aug 23, 2017~I visit Starbucks at least 3 times a week and This location is by far the worst.. They always manage to fill my entire cup with ice.. when I request no ice or lite ice I get a cup that isn't even close to being full.. The drinks are never made the same either, they always taste different even when I order it the same way every time.. it's a shame because this location is right on my way to work and is convenient to stop at, but after all this I don't think I will be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jan 3, 2015~My local Starbucks, not much to say, I think everyone has been to one by now. I will however mention the excellent service here as well as great locale. Friendly Baristas greet you with a smile and call you by name if you've been here enough. You get the usual squatters here that take up space and bandwith, but there is usually a seat or table available inside or out. I am more of a get in and get out customer. This place does have a great view of the PHX Mountains if you're into that stuff.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 21, 2015~Thank God for this Starbucks! The service is amazing, the view is sensational and it's always clean and tidy. The awesome guys who work here (Andrew, Evan and Co) always remember my order and it's like a little oasis away from the busy world!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 31, 2014~Not a lot to say here. Nice Starbucks. Large, clean, kept to a comfortable temperature, like most Starbucks. The staff seem attentive and stuff, like most Starbucks. Bathrooms are clean, like Starbucks. Music is quiet and backgroundy, like most Starbucks. Internet works well, like most Starbucks. Nothing too original or unique, like most Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jul 23, 2014~Love my neighborhood Starbucks staff, however...Parking lot is tricky and does not wrap all of the way around. I see traffic jams as people make 23 point turn around a to exit. They really need signage !!! Management can easily step up here !
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 31, 2014~This is a fantastic above normal Starbucks. I recently visited and ordered an iced coffee and was asked if I wanted regular or `"clover`"? I had no idea what clover was, and I was intrigued. The baristas were such a delight, they educated me about the $30,000 coffee maker and demonstrated it in all it's glory. It was quite a show, and I must say it made a delicious cup of joe!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Feb 27, 2015~Well this isn't typically my favorite Starbucks but what keeps me coming back (besides proximity) is the barista who is native. She is amazing. She remembers my drink even when I haven't seen her in a while. The blonde white girl isn't as amazing and I have had to return my drink before when she made it as it just didn't quite right. Overall though it's a nice location
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Sep 12, 2012~I mainly go here because it is close to work.  The people are very nice, the chai tea is unfortunately inconsistent.  Food is not always fresh but as long as I get my dirty chai then I am happy for the day.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Feb 10, 2017~This is a spacious Starbucks with nice indoor and outdoor seating. They have a machine called Clover`" which can French press any coffee in their store. The Barista recommended Sumatra when I said I wanted a strong brew. It was very good. There was Jazz music playing in the background. An altogether very nice experience. They seem to get alot of regulars.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jun 10, 2015~Gotta lover the Clover brewer and outdoor patio shared with next door veterinary clinic ( their a bit anal about parking in `" their spots`" )even tho their spots only exhist in their delusions.  Its a public plaza - don't believe the 5 minute or faux assigned parking - it's open parking , just this  Starbucks brings in the chill 30-60 year old crowd and the occasional twinks and ultra botched botox frequent fillers.  Really 100+ spots within 100 feet that's great.  Staff here is ok ... To the point and do a good job hancrafting quality.  Some are more friendly than others but ... At least their available if needed and store is spotless, and we'll stocked.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jun 27, 2014~SO RUDE!!! Go to Hava Java on 32nd St and Camelback. Hava Java has better coffee, better pricing and CUSTOMER SERVICE.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Oct 3, 2015~I never write reviews so you know this did not go well.  I walked to this Starbucks on 32nd and Lincoln this morning (Store #16299). New store manager Derek was taking this very busy Fall Saturday morning off and it showed by the service and the staff's overall attitude. (They actually didn't even know the new managers name and they had to ask around and had no contact information for him). Starbucks coffee is always the same, only reason I go back is consistency and customer service. This morning I ordered food (oven was broken and being worked on at the time; manager should have probably been there for this alone)...no problem so I ordered my usual coffee; albeit a very crowded morning I was not asked my name when I ordered. When the coffee came up (a kid named Andrew casually set a coffee on the counter and walked away into the back room without calling out anything at all, let alone a name which wasn't on the cup anyways; while others stood around wondering whose coffee this was). I asked for help and Kyle (who had a horrible attitude and explained he was very busy making coffee) told me to look at the cup and if that's what I ordered it was mine.  Wow, seriously?   Andrew and Kyle and the girl who took my order must have missed Starbucks policy's and procedures meeting or chose not to follow them this morning since there was not a manager around.  Worst customer service experience I have ever had and Kyle might be one of the rudest, most arrogant human beings that I have ever encountered and his only job is to make coffee and follow the Starbucks procedures with a good attitude and good service.  Coffee was good by the way as it always is; hence 2 stars (Service failed miserably).
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jan 9, 2014~I was in the area this morning, and stopped in for my `"hang.`" They didn't have dark roast. The woman said she'd brew some, but laughed at me when I suggested that coffee prepared with different methods tasted different. So I left, and went to a different location where they had dark roast available, and treated me and their own product with respect.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jan 2, 2015~No Pikes place brewed?  That's unheard of for a Starbucks. Not impressive. Second time in two days!  Need a pep talk by management!!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jul 1, 2023~Tried to charge me 8.50 for a Iced venti cafe latte with Oat milk and 1 extra shot.30 year customer won't be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Apr 11, 2020~Worst experience at any Starbucks ever. The kid running the drive through made me repeat my order multiple times because he wasn't paying attention at all. I'd speak and then there would be silence in the other end. Once I get to the window he doesn't repeat the drinks to me just says `" you had the two that are the same right?`" They weren't even the same in the first place. As I answer him he turns away talking with his coworkers and igniioring me. As you already guessed both drinks were wrong and tasted terrible. He was the kid with green hair and shaved sides. I'm so annoyed
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Dec 9, 2019~Photos of corporate app showing hours and holiday menu items which apparently they are out of everything I wouldn't be able to confirm because despite yelp and company showing location should be open it is not very disappointing for me as now my 1.5 hour commute will be without coffee and breakfast as I had a tight schedule and can't stop anywhere else thanks a lot Starbucks not that you care
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Jul 21, 2019~This Starbucks is just inside Fry's and maybe a little bit out of the way, but the service is always good and they always get my custom drink right! (Unlike the one on Camelback just outside)
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Nov 28, 2016~You know one would think that this particular Starbucks has everything going for itself since is in a busy shopping center, lots of potential customers across the street from the light rail, etc. While all of that is fine and dandy there are some flaws that need to be worked out.The drinks are okay. The interior is spacious and the outside patio is shady, which is great for when you don't want the sun beating down on you. The problem appears that management allows the customers / homeless to do whatever they please i.e. napping, selling drugs, bothering patrons for money, etc. Frankly; it's a bit of a turn off, and it discourages regular patronage, because who wants to come to a coffee shop where they don't feel comfortable?
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Dec 15, 2016~The employees at this place are beyond lazy. I understand that mornings can get busy but it's no excuse for repeated mistakes. I am often given the wrong size or blend of coffee, and I've seen my order given to other people numerous times. Yesterday I got a COMPLETELY STALE pastry, and today was given some sort of stupid honey bun instead of a coffee cake, AFTER I waited for 20mins for them to do a new one because they gave mine to someone else. Also they seemed completely unaware that one of their restrooms was out of order when another customer asked.Pathetic - get your stuff together.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Jan 24, 2017~I just got an email response from Starbucks corporate customer service about how dirty their stores, including this one, have become. The wording and spelling were so bad that it's clear Starbucks is outsourcing their customer issues to a third world country and/or people in the US who can't spell or construct a proper sentence.Every time I've been to this store over several weeks, table surfaces and the customer prep area are full of dried spilled drinks, the customer tables and common table are the same, plus old bits of food left behind. No employee seems assigned to keep the dining area clean--I've worked for hours playing road warrior and never once saw anyone come wipe down vacant tabletops or sweep the floor. The floor is full of discarded pieces of sweetener wrappers, straw wrappers and other detritus.This wouldn't pass go in a million years in a regular restaurant. I don't know why Starbucks is so complacent about hygiene and cleanliness in their stores these days. Guess they're catering to the drive-thru business as their primary focus.I'm ready to take my coffee drinking to a local coffee house that keeps up its stores to an acceptable standard of hygiene. Who cares about the food and drinks when the dining environment is substandard?
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jan 27, 2014~Boo so much for adding a business on yelp. lolz. Literally was the second or third person here once they opened. HeheIrma helps me every other morning. She is super friendly and love her energy at 8 in the morning.  :)I LOVE THIS patio here. Loveeee STARBUCKS.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Sep 25, 2021~This is literally the WORST Starbucks on the planet.  All I want is a Venti Chai Tea Latte.  I have gotten one most mornings for the last 10 years.  I generally go to the same 2-3 locations depending on my route to work. About 1 out of every 5 times I go, my drink is bad.  Always the same issue:  whomever prepared it must only press partway down on the pump, thus giving me a $6 hot water instead of a Chai Tea Latte.  Several workers have confirmed this to be the likely reason.  The Starbucks at 7th Ave and Camelback has a special distinction.  Their lattes almost always tastes like a big cup of hot water - almost EVERY time!  I am so sick of wasting my money on this.  The beauty of Starbucks SHOULD be consistency.  This location has been this way since it opened.  They really need new training and/or management.  It's not that hard.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Dec 30, 2013~So there is a Starbucks on every corner but each has it's own unique look and customer service. This was my first visit to this new location. I like the buidling structure. It is quite unique compared to most Starbucks locations that are not attached to other shopping centers. It has this appeal when you walk in that is cozy. very trendy and upbeat but still that relaxing coffee shop we know Startbucks for. The team was mighty friendly. Properly staffed for the amount of traffic I can imagine to walk through the doors. Even though I did not walk in during rush hour there was still plenty of patrons who were meeting or dining. Greeted by the friendly team on staff for the day. My drink was properly made and served with a smile. This location is much larger than traditional Starbucks. Plenty of room to meet a small group inside or outside the venue.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Dec 5, 2015~I really tried to give this location a fair shake, but in the last 3-4 attempts, I've experienced the following...- screwed up orders - orders screwed up even after re-explaining the order (iced coffee with coconut milk? Is it that hard?)- fancy new order screen where you can review and approve your order...if they bothered to use it And, the icing on the cake:- getting stuck in the drive-thru for 30 minutes (no exaggeration) and failing to get as much as an apology from the barista. (But my order was correct!)That last (and final!) time, I actually called corporate from the drive-thru to tell them to get some new management in here, pronto. Props to corporate customer service - they were very gracious and loaded up my gift card in apology. Save yourself the agony and go up the street to 7th Ave &amp; Missouri. Thank me later (maybe I'll see you there!)
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Apr 30, 2016~This is hands down the worst Starbuck's I've ever been to. I always have to wait for a very long time for my drink. I've had them completely forget to make my drink on two occasions. The employees are nice but I think this store is poorly managed. There are homeless people inside of the shop who approach you and ask for change. The staff allows them to hang out inside even though they are not purchasing anything. Crack heads hang out in the bathroom for a very long time so customers cannot use it.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jan 19, 2016~Quick &amp; brief note: I don't drink coffee but want to give kudos to this location whenever I've come here to use the free WiFi while my landline is being repaired, so I can finish my work on my laptop.  The employees have been accompanying and don't mind my spending time here.  I guess it is safe to figure that they knew I needed to catch up on my work, right?  They keep the place clean and they were nice enough to give me the codes to the restroom- even though I don't drink coffee  ;)
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Feb 19, 2021~They gave me a ice water instead of the mango dragon fruit i had ordered and they did not refund me
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Jan 8, 2016~Super friendly employees, quality products and close to my gym...but quite a few individuals asking for money in/out the store.  This location is quite near the light rail.  Parking: There is plenty of parking in the lot. Atmosphere:   Super casual. Plenty of tables and chairs. Some outlets but not tons.    Service:   The staff at this store are amazing.  They are super friendly and chatty. Food:  Like any other Starbucks.  Drinks:  Like any other Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Jul 2, 2016~We pulled up to the Drive-thru and noticed it was empty.  We didn't realize until after we got our order and left that they had already closed.  Our receipt was stamped at 8:07 p.m. - Victoria was very nice and courteous.  The lightrail is right across from this location. Can't say anything else about it.  No wait time this late in the day.  The whole parking lot was empty, including the fast food chain right across from them.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Mar 11, 2018~Usually go to the location down the block but I was walking with my puppy and it is near my job.  Walked up and checked out the menu and backed goods for a moment, as to no one was at the counter. Saw your employees appear. All waking around and talking to one another. I stood with a smile trying to make eye contact with one of them. No one even looked my direction. I continues to wait. 5 minutes and not even a greeting, seated customers had even noticed me there.  I decided to walk out. As I'm walking out a woman is walking in, I decided to look back to see if she had my same issue with receiving assistance. She was helped immediately. It is fair to say that I will never be back here.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Sep 20, 2015~Sloooooow. They messed up my order and to make it worst the girl gave attitude. Really?
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Sep 22, 2016~Rude customer service. The drink we ordered yesterday didn't taste right so we asked about it today. They offered a free drink but then the barista kept rolling her eyes to the cashier and we had to wait a while to get our drinks :/ Not coming here again.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Apr 3, 2016~My husband and I went through the drive-thru on Thursday morning, March 31st on our way to my doctor's appointment. The drive-thru was busy, but we didn't have to wait long to move through it and place an order. We ordered  a Carmel Frappuccino and a Warm Caramelized Honey Latte both grande sized  and two double smoked bacon, cheddar and egg sandwiches. We love their coffee drinks, but we have not tried until that day their breakfast sandwiches that are a fairly new menu item. The sandwiches were fresh and tasted really good. Each bite melted in my mouth it was that good. The bread was fresh, and the egg tasted as if they had just taken it out of the hen's nest to prepare. The cheese had a flavorful taste in each bite. We decided this is one of the best breakfast sandwiches we have had in a long time.The Baristas are friendly and helpful. There was a different breakfast sandwich we were going to order but the young man who was very apologetic explained that they were out of the sandwich. No problem, we will order it the next time.I recommend this location if you are in the area. It is convenient to stop and order your favorite coffee drink, tea or sandwich. I don't think you will be disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Mar 26, 2016~Like the drinks, but why so pricey??? I would visit more id they would lower the prices.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Sep 30, 2014~My husband and I were out and about and like so many pregnant women, with only a couple weeks left to go, I found myself with the sudden urge to use the bathroom. We stopped into a Starbucks on 7th ave and Camelback in Phoenix and noticed that they had keypad locks on the bathroom doors. I waddled up to the counter and asked the barista if I could please have the code for the ladies room. He asked if I was going to buy something because he could only give me the code if I made a purchase. I replied that I'm pregnant and need to use the bathroom now. He again repeated that I would have to purchase something. I glared at him and walked away to my husband and told him that I was denied access.Understandably, this upset Brad who marched right over to the Starbucks employee and in a forceful tone again stated that I am pregnant and should be granted use of the bathroom. They went back and forth for a moment, all the while the employee repeating that toilet access comes with a purchase. Finally Brad put his credit card on the counter and said, `"Charge me for whatever and give me the code!`". To this, the barista said no and refused to sell him anything, insisting instead that we leave and go to the Fry's down the street and use their facilities. A woman in line behind Brad who had been witnessing this bathroom denial insanity said that she was about to be making a purchase and asked for the code. The unrelenting employee refused and instead told my husband that if he didn't leave, he would be calling the police.At this point, Brad realized that my urge was becoming urgent so we left and used the bathroom at a much more accepting Subway next door. I don't know if there is any civil or federal code that permits access of a toilet to a pregnant women in the state of Arizona, but there should be extenuating circumstances regardless. Especially when there is no signage stating that the bathrooms are for customers only.I have never experience anything like this in my life. To unapologetically deny a very pregnant woman the use of a bathroom is wrong. This male barista exhibited a total lack of compassion and understanding, not to mention zero common scence. I hope that other pregnant women never have to experience this kind of embarrassment.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Mar 7, 2015~These guys here are always very helpful and make a very quick and quality drink. I go here at least once a week most of the time and have never had any issues with quality or service. I just discovered the joys of a java chip frappachino and it is probably better when I didn't know about it because now I will be here all the time for the amazingness. Seriously though come in stop by and check it out.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Jun 30, 2014~The upside of this Starbucks is that it has one of the world's biggest patios. Seriously. It's an enormous wrap-around patio.....like something you'd see on a southern Victorian-style home.....oooohhhh now I'm craving fried chicken.....I digress.So yeah, they have a pretty bad patio. I mean bad in the Micheal Jackson sense, not in the textbook definition. It's even full of misters to keep it cool. It's still a bit toasty to sit out there in the summer though.What I don't understand about this laptop-dwellers' paradise is that they have such limited seating indoors. Seriously. Half of the restaurant is empty floor space. Why not jam pack it full of tables and chairs? Back east, that floor space is top dollar....tables are so squeezed into spaces, you sneeze and you hit the guy three tables over. Needless to say, you'll need to get there early to claim your spot if you want to sit indoors. Or you can brave the elements and sit outside. More tables out there.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Apr 16, 2018~Slow service, took 5 minutes just to take my order and another 10 to get my drink in the drive thru
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 23, 2016~The WORST Starbucks I have ever been to in AZ! I stopped by a few months ago and it was a horrible experience then, but this morning my go-to place was out of the question so I decided to try this spot again- BIG MISTAKE. The drive thru line was long, 8 cars long. Finally get to the order screen and was greeted with `"did we get your order yet?`" Ahhh... Nope. Placed drink order and the reply was `"pull up for total`" EXCUSE ME...I'd like to order a breakfast sandwich. `"Oh. Which on?`" On average it was taking 6 minutes to `"help`" each customer. Parking lot mostly empty- so not a lot of walk in customers- as observed by looking in the storefront. Counted no less than 5 employees. FINALLY get to the window- no greeting, breakfast sandwich cold and drink was wrong. I believe `"you had one job`" is applicable here.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~May 2, 2014~Great Starbucks whether you go through the drive thru or inside. I stop by every morning (drive thru). Service is quick and the employees are all really nice. My order has always been correct.The inside is spacious and there is a nice sized patio. It's always been real clean anytime I have been inside and even if there are a lot of people, it never feels very crowded.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Mar 6, 2016~While rolling down Camelback Road on our way to check out some San Diego Padre Spring Training, the thought of coffee became almost to much to bare.  There were still many miles to be traveled and caffeine would be needed to safely complete the journey.A quick glance of a down the road Starbucks was all that it took to activate the right turn blinker.  There was however, a quick sweep of the area.  There was some shady looking folks roaming about the area.  Keep you head on a swivel.  This location is a stand a large stand alone structure.  I must say it is probably the largest one I have ever visited.  The drive-thru we pulled into seemed to stretch a country mile. It's more than capable of supporting whatever high volume traffic seeking a legal stimulate to support them.  There was six vehicles ahead of use.  Normally, I would take a pass rather than feeling like a coffee lemming,but something told me this location could take any java infused, lemming migration in stride.We pulled in and the line keep on rolling to the cliff that is glorious window.  The voice on the other end of the squawk box was friendly enough.The line continued to roll and in short order, we would pay and receive our drinks.   A friendly face now with a squawk box voice this coffee and tea slinging expert would set the tone with happiness.  While heading toward the 17, we just might be stopping again on our AZ adventure.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Aug 23, 2016~Still can't really find any reasons for more than 3 stars. Customer service is not reliably good. Many times I have come in, like today, and the condiment bar is out of napkins and in disarray. Patio seating seems to rarely get cleaned.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Feb 25, 2015~Drive through service has declined noticeably over the last few months. SLOW! I always have to repeat drink order. They ask, don't pay attention &amp; ask you to repeat yourself. Drink comes with a layer of unmixed syrup in the bottom? You want me to mix it while driving?
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Jul 31, 2014~Newer store with drive thru. Employees seem friendly and helpful. Drive thru was quick.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jul 20, 2016~Icy and didn't taste good. Like really icy. It didn't even have a good coffee flavor. It tasted like old coffee flavored ice chips covered in whipped cream.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Mar 12, 2016~This place sucks, I didn't even get cream cheese with my bagel, they gave me butter, , you can't eat a bagel without cream cheese!! Saturday ruined
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Jan 11, 2014~Update: they're getting better.  I got an iced coffee for a day of errands.  Although I still prefer to frequent local joints, this was cold and refreshing.  The service has also improved.I have gone against my better judgement today by going through the drive thru at the new Starbucks by my house.   I try to support local businesses and want to commend SB for retrofitting  an old restaurant BUT have some reservations about their ability to be successful based on the service I received.  I pulled in behind one car at 3pm on a Saturday and there were at least 5 employees inside with a couple of customers waiting at the counter.  I waited 9 minutes at the window after having to repeat my order twice and when I got it home, it was wrong.  It was a skinny hazelnut and a lemon loaf, NOT rocket science! To top things off, the guy waiting on me said HE had to make my coffee.    What is that supposed to mean?! I know your staff is new and are working out the kinks but I expect more from you.  It's not like you have no competition.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~May 4, 2014~Edit: This location has now been open for several months and my previous grievances has been resolved.  It's now a pleasure to come here in the mornings and my order is always filled in a timely manner. I was delighted when I found out this Starbucks location was opening. I work down the street so I thought this would become a regular stop for me on my morning commute.The employees of this location have all been very nice and welcoming, however, the morning crew really needs a stronger manager to be working with them. I stopped frequenting this location because of the snail like pace of the service. No matter if I go through the drive thru or walk into the store the team can never complete my order in a timely manner.The order I am having trouble with consists of a medium coffee and a breakfast sandwich. Obviously the coffee is given to me immediately, but the breakfast sandwich has always taken at least 15 minutes to get to me and usually cold. Somehow my order always seems to get lost amongst the employees.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Sep 8, 2015~I used to go to this Starbucks all the time, but it was my last visit a couple days ago that concerns me. There are ANTS on the bar where the espresso machine is and where they serve the drinks. And they were there at my next visit. Starbucks, come on. Clean your store and get rid of the ants. That's disgusting. I'll be choosing a different location from now on.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Mar 3, 2017~I bought a coffee at a different Starbucks location drive thru and sadly I didn't try it until I was a few miles away. The coffee was really bad  I called this Starbucks since it was on my way and they took care of me with enthusiasm! They made me a fresh coffee for no charge and I was very pleased.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Oct 27, 2015~Coffee frap has junk of ice but when I ask for remaking, they threw it on me like ask for free coffee. Horrible service!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Dec 20, 2014~I'm glad there's a SB near but this one is ridiculously slow. Seriously. How long does it really take. I see the commitment to the drive thru but you totally ousted me because I walked in and ordered. Who waits for a cherry oat bar for that long as well. Apartment I do. Unfortunate experience here. Smh.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Jun 20, 2014~Staff is great, product is great, poor location. You will be harassed by homeless people and pedestrians if you sit on the patio. It is right next to one of the busiest light rail stops. Constant panhandlers if you are on the patio, no joke. After I had 5 in 10 minutes once, I stopped going there.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Aug 20, 2014~My first visit to this Starbucks and I liked it. A community table in addition to many 2-person tables and patio seating (too hot/humid to enjoy in August). Another successful by-the-book Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Oct 31, 2014~I love this Starbucks because it's never overly packed. It's the biggest Starbucks in Phoenix and it'a very spacious and comfortable. They had to put a code on the bathroom locks because so many homeless people would come to use the bathrooms, some even took showers inside of there. I remember once waiting for a long time to access the bathroom because of that. Now that they put codes, it's been better. The employees are very nice. About a year ago they had gardening for kids and they had a fundraiser for one of their employees who was sick. I like seeing that it's one big family. This is one of my favorite Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Dec 17, 2014~I ordered a lime refresher and I swear the lime in it looked like it had been sitting out back in the dumpsters for a few weeks before being put in my drink. On a good note the workers were very friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~May 7, 2016~This is consistently THE slowest Starbucks, and they don't seem to be doing anything to remedy this.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Apr 5, 2016~Disappointed with my drive thru experience. I think the barista who took my payment stole my credit card number. Very very frustrating, beware.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Dec 26, 2014~Kinda disappointed. We were panhandled in the parking lot, and then subsequently on the patio.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~May 27, 2015~The drive thru has a fancy webcam setup where you actually see the face of the person taking your order. He wasn't very pleasant though.  Still, it was your average Starbucks experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~May 30, 2014~There have been 2 or 3 restaurants in this location over the past 10 years or so and I think that Starbucks hit the nail on the head by taking over this location.  The patio is awesome!  Great for people watching (trust me, there are a lot of people to be watched from the light rail, to the queens over at Charlie's).  My biggest gripe.  The staff seem so discombobulated with their service.  They always seem to be going in neutral.  I have personally had to wait 10 minutes for an iced coffee which is already brewed and I avoid the drive thru at all cost.  I am not a fan of drive thru's at any type of restaurant.  Overall, this is a great location and I will continue to be a regular but please, get the customer service kinks ironed out.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Feb 28, 2015~It would be hard to get slower service. No matter how busy it gets at the counter, they have a disproportionate number of staff working the drive thru. Typically, they have at least one staff person walking around seemingly doing nothing. Never super busy and lots of room.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Nov 21, 2023~09/29/2023Trying to find the closest Starbucks could be a challenge at times but this one is conveniently located inside the Fry's Food &amp; Drug. We are really stopping here grabbing one for the road. So you can do your grocery shopping wide awake or hop in the car with your beverage forgetting about your groceries. Since this is part of the grocery store, your receipt shows the grocery store name so you cannot redeem your stars at this location. You will continue earning stars with your purchase though. Since there wasn't anyone here, there was no line. It's really relaxed at this location but you won't be able to sit down and hop on the Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi doesn't exist here from Starbucks and there aren't any tables with electrical outlets for you to camp out. Enjoy your beverage and snacks.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Aug 15, 2024~Congratulations on your best of Phoenix health inspection scores. This says a lot about the cleanliness of your location and employees. Also congratulations on the new CEO Brian Nichols. He's going to do an amazing job leading the company.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Jul 1, 2021~SB on Camelback just west of 7th Ave.(the shopping center has an LA Fitness). It has a large seating area with a private conference room that can be rented out as well. There are no cushioned lounge type chairs, just the standard wood ones in the main seating area. There's a large patio.Alot of sketchy, junkie types were loitering on and in the property detracting from the atmosphere.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Sep 8, 2024~i always come to this Starbucks they usually do good and make the drinks well my only concern is I got my coffee filled half way today and I know it sounds petty but if your paying 10 bucks for a coffee your gonna want the full thing if I wanted a small amount I would of got a grande . When I asked if they can fill it more they looked at me confused . I worked at a Starbucks I know it can get crazy but also it's was slow and I know the person making it was being lazy
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~May 9, 2024~I bought the new boba drink, all the boba was popped, I asked for light ice, they filled the cup to the brim with ice
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Feb 16, 2024~A young man named Quinn was very efficient and polite and had a very nice welcoming personality. Glad to have been here!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Mar 8, 2023~Horrible location just went lady refused to add a drink to my order plus I ordered a drink that wasn't made correctly it was half ass she's like we're closing soon I can't fix it items are put up if I could a negative zero I would will never return to this location
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~May 31, 2023~Way understaffed and was told to contact a manager and have them get more people as cars were backing out of the drive thru line.  2:15 on a Wednesday
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Apr 24, 2017~Thank you to the barista today who was so friendly! This location is huge as it had regular indoor seating, a huge outdoor patio, and a conference room as well. We got our drinks and sat outside as it's so pretty out today. It was around 3pm and this place was flowing with teenage kids and homeless people. It was so annoying as we had teenage kids and grown people coming up to us asking for money for McDonald's and the city bus. So if you do come here wanting some quiet time, don't sit outside... but hey four stars for the friendly employee working today!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 21, 2022~Worst service ever. Waited 15 mins in line with no exit, pulled up and they didn't have ny order. I said I wanted a tall iced coffee with cream again, they couldn't understand what I meant, I had enough and told then not to worry about it.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~May 12, 2023~They don't give you the right amount of liquid. I ordered 3 coffees and the pink drink. The coffees had about 1 1/2 in less coffee (with regular ice) and the pink drink close to 3 in less liquid (no ice). Honestly just make the extra drive and go to the one on 7th ave and Missouri. That's my go to after picking my daughter up from school and they're super friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Nov 30, 2016~You say `"Tomato I say Tamato,`" You say `"Coffee and I say STARBUCKS!`" What a beautiful location. Unlike most Starbucks in the valley this central location has really peaked my interest. Not only is it renovated but it is not your typical modern feel. It has an Arizona Artsy twist to it. Very nice inside with plenty of seating. Matter of fact their is a large private meeting room that is enclosed by glass doors. Perfect place to rent out for a meeting and enjoy your favorite Starbucks drink. This is a drive-thru location however, I have only picked up to go as a walk in. The staff is very attentive and friendly. My drink and food were made to order perfectly.  I walked the small shopping area inside that is stocked with all the great Starbucks coffee mugs, cups, snacks and much more. They even have a cooler for fast pick to go items. The really cool thing I noticed when checking out is they sell a treat by Sassy Cake by Nina. Very cool of Starbucks to support a local business. This is now my new spot. Way to go Starbucks on 7th Ave.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~May 21, 2022~Save yourself time and go to a different location! They do not know how to make a drink to save their lives. I went through the drive-through and my drink was made wrong. I went back through and instead of remaking the drink they tried to give me the sides to add into my now cold drink. When I refused that solution they took the drink I had already sipped off of and reheated it. Isn't that a health code violation? And after all of that they still didn't get the drink right.I will never return to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jul 25, 2018~Good customer service good a LONG way! I wish I would have caught the cashiers name but I was smitten by her positive vibes I didn't get a chance to look! Either way good job Starbucks you picked a good one!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Mar 20, 2022~Starbucks really needs to work on their Quality Assurance. I get same coffee, yet taste surprises me every single time because it's never consistent. Too sweet, not sweet at all, can't taste coffee at all, or it's too bitter and old, etc. Wish I could a refund for every shitty coffee I paid money for.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Sep 4, 2017~I moved to this area this past summer so this is my new Starbucks stop. I've been a few times now &amp; have had all good experiences! Very fast drive-thru, friendly service, food &amp; drinks exactly how I like them. This morning I swung by to get some breakfast &amp; a Pumpkin Spice Latte, Todd assisted me &amp; he was excellent! Kind &amp; efficient!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Dec 23, 2022~Worst latte ever. Ordered a tall triple. Tasted like water. Take your money elsewhere.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Aug 14, 2017~I was asking about the new tea flavors and wow what a mess. Maybe it was the girl's first day, but come on this is your job. The music was sooooo loud that I couldn't hear my tunes on my headphones on 6. Crazy. It's Starbucks so you know what you're in for.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jul 31, 2020~I have been drinking Starbucks for years. While I prefer a small local coffee shop, you can't argue with the convenience and availability of a drive thru Starbucks. This location however, has done nothing but upset me and slow me down rather than offering any convenience, or even any coffee.On 5 separate occasions, I have sat in this drive thru, ordered the same drink (dirty chai with an extra shot) and received a cup of lightly flavored milk. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.On 3 occasions I have gone back and asked them to fix the drink, which they reluctantly did. I shouldn't have to choose to either waste my $7 or make myself late for work because the employees don't know how to pull espresso.I know Starbucks has a big machine that takes all of the craft out of being a barista... but the espresso is the main ingredient guys!! I wouldn't serve you spaghetti without the pasta! If I wanted a glass of warm milk I'd hang out at home with my cat.I will never return to this location and am really getting a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended) for Starbucks in general.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Mar 24, 2019~Definitely will not return. I came in 30 minutes after they opened. Pulled up in the drive through, waited, said hello multiple times, no answer. I pulled up to the window and could see two people inside. When I got to the window the girl was nice however didn't apologize. When I received my drink it had 2 ice cubes in it. I asked for light but not like that. Oh joy...lukewarm tea Starbucks get it together... learn how to serve people not just make drinks
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Oct 7, 2017~This barista ignored me waiting for a mobile order for 10 minutes. There is a sign that says pick up your mobile order here, so I waited where she was working. There are 3 others working with her, if that makes a difference because to me it does. I told her I had a mobile order at around 5 minutes of waiting, 9 minutes after it was ordered, and she didn't do anything until 5ish minutes later when someone else came up and asked for a cheese Danish that was missing. My latte was sitting there on the other side of the glass the entire time. It was out of my reach or you best your ass I would have just grabbed it. And I know how fucking rude that sounds, do t reach across my counter, but I've been a barista at places busier than this Starbucks with a combined experience of 15 years serving pissy people their coffee, and ignoring someone is no way to treat your customers that are standing around waiting for something that shouldn't take as long as the seven-person line because it was ordered ahead and all you had to do was literally engage with the customer to figure that out. I've always engage customers within about 2 minutes, even if they were upset or standoffish or what not. Good customer service is not letting your bad attitude/mood affect how you work and how you interact with customers. This time it was her, but it's happened to me three other times when I was here which is why this isn't my preferred Starbucks location, and why I am making this post count with faces to people that continue the problem.Moral of the story is don't order ahead here because despite the fact that don't make your drink first they won't give it to you for another 20 minutes, so it takes less time to wait in a line here to get your latte.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Feb 7, 2022~Opening hours 5:30am. Have visited this location multiple times between 530 and 6 with no luck in getting service. I go through the drive through and can see the workers inside talking with one another. Man this is annoying.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 17, 2019~I go to this Starbucks on weekly basis,lately they have been messing up my order. The drive thru lines have been so long &amp; the customer service hasn't been so great. I'm not too happy with this place anymore. Update***I ordered a drink at 3:40pm,I was the only car in the drive thru at the time,i waited 10+ minutes for my drink &amp; girl at the drive thru window said `"I'm sorry for the wait`" meanwhile my frappe was melting....it was very slow for business so I shouldn't have to wait for more than 5 mins. When a customer waits more than 5 minutes for a drink it should be free or upgraded! I work in retail and we don't let our customers wait more than 5 minutes for their order and if they do we offer and upgrade or something free.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Jun 14, 2019~I go to this Starbucks on weekly basis,lately they have been messing up my order. The drive thru lines have been so long &amp; the customer service hasn't been so great. I'm not too happy with this place anymore.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jun 28, 2019~Front cash was extremely rude, very nasty attitude. It's 7:30am in the morning... if you don't feel like coming to work stay home. After I placed my order, I asked for the bathroom door code and had to wait for an employee to stop working and walk me over and push in the code so I couldn't see it. REALLY STARBUCKS! We have to wait to be let in the restroom after spending money in you shop. Crazy. Will never go to this location again.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Dec 29, 2018~I've visited this location for about four years, except for a hiatus since this past early summer. The store has gone downhill. The furnishings have been rearranged and some eliminated, so now the store resembles some kind of sparsely-furnished warehouse. The new chairs are hugely uncomfortable. It's 40 degrees outside, yet the A/C is running full blast. Street people are napping at a couple of tables and monopolizing the power outlets at the small tables against the outer walls. Several disheveled, mentally ill people have been walking around babbling and none of the staff has batted an eye. A family was just run out of the store by one of these riffraffians and his gibberish (they had sat down at the `"community table`" where the mentally ill man had been anchored). Tables are dirty, and the staff isn't very busy. A woman at one of the tables just chugged the final bit of a bottle of wine. WTF, Starbucks? I just popped an email to the store manager and the district manager. They may as well re-name this location Streeter-bucks or SMI-bucks.The coffee and service here are fine. But the (non-paying) clientele has become too off-putting for me to patronize this location any more. I have to deal with them daily on the streets and public transit because I have no choice. When I visit a place to relax with food and/or drinks, I expect well-behaved, non-intrusive, clean patrons. Bonus points if they're not using a business as a drop-in center but actually supporting the business.I'm outta here, permanently.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Mar 5, 2020~First, I came for happy and they were telling me I already used it which I didn't and refused to give me the deal. After I complained enough they did it. The drinks took forget to come out and service was absolutely terribleness can't believe people actually go to this location!!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jan 13, 2019~Left immediately. She said they are out of cinnamon.  Ridiculous!  They are 50 feet from a grocery store too!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Nov 28, 2020~You may wish to avoid this location if you actually expect to get the variety of coffee that you order and pay for. Its now been twice that I have ordered a Blonde Americano, only to later realize that they slipped me their standard dark Pike at the drive through. Do you really think your customers aren't going to notice the difference? I attribute this to poor management who don't keep an eye on the indifferent children they hire. Folks, do yourselves a favor and get your coffee somewhere else. One star for dishonesty and poor work ethic.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Nov 2, 2018~Ordered an eggnog latte in the drive through at 6:15 am on 11/2, specifically asked about the free red cup when I ordered, and was told `"it comes with the drink.`" When I received my drink - no red cup. However, the lady in front of me in line in the drive thru received one! Disappointed in the communication and management at this store. Will not be returning to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Mar 25, 2019~I had went threw the drive thru today at 8pm after looking up what time they close which is at 9pm!! I went and no answer at drive thru tried calling then drove up to the window where the lady just looked at me and shook her head and worded that they were closed while not even coming to the window to explain why they were closed an hour a head! I keep giving this Starbucks a chance due to it being so close to home but I would rather go far for great service then the bad service I always receive from the employees here!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jun 21, 2022~jayson and karissa are in charge of this poorly organized store. horrible customer service and management is disgustingly rude. super slow with drinks and never right.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Feb 27, 2017~To my fellow college students that come to coffee shops to just `"study`" don't come here if you think at some point you may need to use the rest room, because they will not give you the code unless you purchase something from here. Just a warning to those fellow college students that don't always buy coffee when they go do their homework.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Jun 23, 2018~I love starbucks. Ive always gotten the raspberry white chocolate mocha frappachino. Its great. Every starbucks I go to makes it the right way. The staff is friendly and the starbucks is always clean. The tables are clean and there is no trash
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Aug 17, 2019~I waited for my tea for 25 minutes, which I uusally wouldn't mind, but this location was pretty slow, so the tea should have been out faster. There were customers after me who had gotten their drinks/food about 5 minutes after ordering, so maybe the staff should work on the order of making the drinks. The staff was nice, but they should work on service :)
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jul 23, 2018~I went to this Starbucks on 7/22/18. Google indicates that it is open until 9pm and Starbucks website indicates that it is open until 8:30pm. I arrived in the drive thru at 8:25pm. I waited for 5 minutes and then drove to the window. When I arrived at the window, multiple staff ignored I was there. When I arrived you weren't closed and I should have been served. Not cool at all.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Jun 11, 2017~I just can't anymore...at least not for coffee.  Maybe for a protein box and spritzer.  We stopped in to this location while in the area because we had a gift card.  The location was pretty cool.  There aren't many stand alone Starbucks out there so that made this somewhat unique.  Unfortunately, it isn't located in the best area of town.  It does have a nice patio with misters as well as a pretty cool conference room, so the establishment itself deserves a star.  Unfortunately, our orders didn't quite hit the mark, as usual.  Our caramel iced coffee with cream tasted like iced milk and I should know better by now not to order one of those nasty premade breakfast sandwiches.  Basically, Starbucks is the McDonalds of coffee and I'm not quite sure why I keep going back.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Feb 7, 2020~Tatum is the best customer service is unbelievable. Visit her location every Thursday and it's  always professional and excellent service.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~May 19, 2018~The girl in charge was very nice. She was training a new girl I think. But the experienced girl came over to help customize a drink since a seasonal drink was not available. Didn't catch her name, taller blonde girl.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Feb 3, 2018~While I frequent plenty of Starbucks'  this was my first time in this location,  the drive thru needs some work , I do have my drinks the handed me a chai tea , I got a white chocolate mocha no whip add caramel drizzle and then I had to request my debit card back bc the attendant thought the transaction was over ...
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Nov 19, 2016~Very large store complete with a drive-thru and a large covered outdoor patio.  Service is good, but they tend to shutdown the patio down as early as ninety minutes to two hours prior to closing if it's slow.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Mar 7, 2019~This location sucks..  They need to replace all the people that work here..  I placed an online order and wanted to use my award to pay for it but accidentally used my card to pay to it instead..  I couldn't figure out how to reverse or cancel my order online so I asked them..  they said they didnt know how to do it (even the manager).  And that if I canceled my order then I have to call the app to get my refund..  and I asked them for the numbers and no one knew..  they kept on saying call the app..  what's the f??  I showed them the app and I asked where the numbers and they have no clues...  omg I just wanted to use the reward or give me my damm money back.. why is it so hard??  So I told them give me the fk drink since they all ready carve my card
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~May 16, 2017~Conveniently located but lacks enough parking especially for peak times. The bathrooms were really clean. Baristas were so friendly and my drink was great!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Feb 11, 2018~Used to get decent service at this place.  Showed up his evening at 8:30, 30 minutes prior to close to get three lbs of whole bean espresso and despite staff walking around inside with headsets on no one took my drive thru order or came to the window to help me.  Nonexistent service means I sure won't return.  As someone who regularly reloads a hundred plus in my Starbucks card there's no incentive for me to continue supporting their nonexistent service.  I can buy local for less but more importantly these days, I can get consistent service which is the whole reason I ever saw a benefit in Starbucks in the first place.  No reason to return, rather lose my the money I have on my card now than support such a disappointing business.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jun 21, 2019~every Starbucks in the Phoenix valley has veranda or a blonde blend on display but it's never brewed. pour overs taste disgusting
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~May 15, 2017~This afternoon at the Starbucks drive thru was atrocious. I was asked for my order, placed it, but was interrupted and told to 'hold on a minute' only to be left waiting at the speaker in silence for what seemed like forever while several cars stacked up behind me (maybe only 3 or 4 minutes but it was still awkward). I placed my order AGAIN when prompted and was told to drive around. I pulled up to a shut window where I waited another 5 minutes. I saw a man standing inside, bleached blonde hair and gaunt, but not doing anything. Maybe he was taking orders? But there weren't a big number of cars in line or in the parking lot so what was going on??... He finally opened the window but shook his head, waved me away as if something were more important, shut the window again and walked away. When he came back (How long had it been now, maybe 10-12 min?) he asked my drink order, found my drink in a line up and brought it to me, then looked at me as if I had offended him (?) I had to ask how much the drink was because I was never given an amount. I gave him money, got my change but, of course, no receipt and had the window shut in my face once again. At this point I was late for work and couldn't stand to wait around anymore. I was hoping this could be my place to stop before work but this wasn't worth it at all. You're better off going into the Fry's or up the road to a different Starbucks. I'm still thinking about how rude and disappointing this stop was and it was 10 hours ago.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Dec 21, 2019~THIS.STARBUCKS.**LOCATION**Is most definitely :MY - GO - TO!!!!They really MUST have some of the VERY BEST and GREATEST MANAGEMENT!!!!EVERY - SINGLE - PERSON - on this STAFF, has always been :the most enjoyable, (especially when I needed it!!!!),..AND -MOST fun, friendly, and way beyond enlightening for my visit, and for the comfy feeling when leaving there!!!Not just as EMPLOYEES of an establishment,..BUT :AS REAL, loving, encouraging, and courteous PEOPLE!!!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Feb 16, 2012~I have found over the years that some of the nicest Baristas and Starbucks Cafes are in grocery stores!This Safeway, like Fry's (not Fry's Marketplace) has a stand alone Starbucks inside.   Brandy and Maria, and all the Baristas are very competent and friendly.  If you have never been here before, then there are a few differences between a Safeway Starbucks and a company owned Starbucks.  First, if you use your Starbucks card, remember that you don't get free syrup, or refills of the drip coffee.  Second, when using your Starbucks card on the POS machine, tap Gift Card.  If you don't, it won't recognize it and you'll need to pay cash, or use another credit card.  Other than that, it's the same Starbucks, with less crowds and a lot more seats.Enjoy!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jun 15, 2021~I come in almost daily for my Coffee fix and am always greeted by Sam. He is such a polite young man and always chats with his customers and really gets to know them. He always knows my order and is always smiling and quick to help. He seems to be there the most often out of the employees (who are all nice) which shows he is reliable and always willing to help. The coffee always comes out great as well as short lines and wait time then your regular Starbucks. I will continue to keep coming for my daily fix. Thank you.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~May 12, 2021~Lily at evening shift is super super slow. I waited 15 minutes for a medium latte. With one person ahead of me.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Aug 18, 2015~So three reviews mean A-OK.I'm a regular coffee drinker and my fiancee loves her frap something or other, but as always, Starbucks delivers about 90% of the time.Occasionally the espresso tastes a little off, but if there is ever an issue, they make it right.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Apr 11, 2015~Asked for nonfat no whip bev Made it wrong and when ibobjected i got eye rolling and argumentI asked remake it  only fair considering the premium priceVery tempted to speak w managerWont b back here again
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Jul 8, 2017~If Gilda or a young man is working, you'll get a perfectly made drink. Those two do a great job and are personable. Today my husband picked me up my usual drink (venti iced lightly sweet chai) and it tastes like milk. I'm wondering if the person put ANY chai in my drink. I asked my husband who was working, and it wasn't either of the regular two people I've mentioned above. So sometimes when the right people are working, you'll get a consistent and tasty drink, but if not, you might get something terrible.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Aug 4, 2017~I have shopped at this Safeway for years and I go several times a week. There is a Starbucks inside. The manager that use to be here moved to the Safeway on Greenway/Tatum. She was awesome and took time to know the customers and accommodate to them.The barristas here are not happy. The coffee machines weren't working last week and they could care less. Very indifferent to their jobs. They never smile.I will have to retrain myself to go to the Safeway/Starbucks at Greenway/Tatum.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Jul 17, 2017~I am not one to write bad reviews, I usually only leave good ones but I guess today will be the day. I come her almost on the daily and Unfortunately some of the barristas have no customer service skills. Today as I approached the counter the girl rolled her eyes and annoyingly said `"what can I get for you?`" . So I replied with Hi! And she then said in her disturbed voice, `"hi, what can I get for you`". She clearly did not want to help me so I let her know I would get my usual drink elsewhere. I've learned that it's not what you say rather than how you say it. Unfortunately this location keeps disappointing me as it has happened several times and at different times of the day. The upgrades are great but how great is the location if the staff still lacks customer service skills.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~May 31, 2017~This is a great Starbucks especially after the renovations, employees are extremely polite it is actually inside of a Safeway and it's well-kept. I like the seating arrangements it's one of the better Starbucks in the area and I do strongly recommend that you check them out
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Sep 14, 2015~It's not the best coffee because it's Starbucks, but as far as Starbucks is concerned I've haven't had a bad drink from here and the staff is very friendly!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~May 30, 2017~WORST service. Came to this location on 5/29. The barista was so rude. Didn't even acknowledge me cause she was on her phone texting for a while. Then when I ordered my drink she acted like I was a nuisance... then came today (5/30) and it is now 5:33am and they are not even open. The Safeway cashier said `"they should be open but someone didn't show up to work today`" no surprise...
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jul 18, 2014~Have been receiving consistently stellar customer service from the Starbucks in Safeway at 64th &amp; Greenway in Scottsdale, so Many Thanks to John, Robyn, Kyle, Lisa and Nicole for their time and efforts in making our Starbucks customer experience one of the best around the valley...!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Aug 12, 2015~Great service but store has little seating. Use a different Starbucks if you want to hang out and do homework. Loud and noisy because it's in a grocery store
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~Oct 19, 2020~This is not a burn on this particular Starbucks as I know they are not in the back cooking the food and this has been a common problem with several of the Starbucks I have been to in general. When u order a Bacon Egg Bite you expect some bacon in your egg bite. As shown in the picture, this is pitiful, there's one piece of bacon. It reminds me of the scene in Casino with the blueberry muffins. Some guy out there is getting an egg bite loaded with bacon, meanwhile I'm stuck with this one. Get it together Starbucks!
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Oct 13, 2024~I usually enjoy stopping by Starbucks for a quick bite while I grocery shop, but lately, it's been a frustrating experience. The croissants, which are one of my favorite treats, are consistently out of stock. No matter what time I go, whether it's early morning or mid-afternoon, there's never a croissant to be found! It's disappointing to see a place with such a small menu unable to keep up with demand for a basic item like this.Starbucks, if you're going to feature croissants on your menu, you need to stock more of them. Otherwise, what's the point? ‍
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Aug 15, 2014~The drinks are not nearly as good as standard Starbucks locations.  Barista seemed more interested in flirting with a coworker than helping.  Not to mention a tip jar seems appalling to me. Really,  for doing your job. Does everything get tipped now?
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~Oct 18, 2018~Employees seemed to be having a hard time with morning rush on a Thursday 1030a.  Long time to order and get drink.  I watched 3 people take back their order because it was wrong all before i got mine.  Then i overheard a girl get hers and comment that it tasted bad.  I asked for a little addition to my drink of another product, but either someone forgot to pass it on, someone forgot to do it, or a different person  made it.  I asked for it to be added and ended up waiting a few more minutes for it to be remade! Ehhhh
Peoria, AZ 85382~4~Jan 11, 2019~I usually will go out of my way to stop into this Starbucks. The staff at this Starbucks is pretty seasoned, and they know how to make the coffee taste great. They are friendly and remember your recent coffee orders. They rarely have lines which is great for when your in a rush.
Peoria, AZ 85382~2~May 21, 2016~The staff was nice, but when I got my coffee the cup was just a little more than halfway full. That was pretty disappointing.
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Jun 24, 2015~I like driving to this Starbucks with my girls when we want a treat. They love the cake pops and Tea and I love the white chocolate mocha with Carmel . We always use the drive through instead of going in)
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~Dec 24, 2023~Came in today and ordered an iced sugar cookie latte and java chip frappuccino. The latte was made hot which is no big deal. But after leaving we realized the java chip had zero coffee and was basically a milk shake. With it being christmas eve i understand they are busy. I tried calling several times just to get my money back for the in correct drink, but after several attempts i couldn't get through. Not angry just disappointed that i didn't get what i paid for.
Peoria, AZ 85382~1~Oct 7, 2019~This is a convenient location, but the customer service is really hit or miss.  On this visit, It was definitely a miss!My Girlfriend and I both made attempts to exchange pleasantries with the young lady, but obviously she was choosy at who she was nice with!  She had been complaining to the previous customer about being by herself there, and the customer had familiarity with the work so she got great customer service.We, on the other hand, it was like pulling teeth!  Luckily the drinks were great!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Oct 29, 2019~Great service Wonderful management Thanks Amber for welcoming me with such enthusiasm and positivity!!! Not to mention the drinks you made are AWESOME!!!You ROCK!!!I appreciate y'all!!Will definitely be back for sure!!!Probably tomorrow (((lol)))
Peoria, AZ 85382~3~Aug 3, 2021~I asked a question few days ago why all the Starbucks in Fry's grocery store don't have there Blond Roast  coffee brew when customers want it . They only do a pour over which takes a long time to receive &amp; doesn't taste as good as the brewed blond Roast . Yelp decided to take off because they would get bad reply's . I thought my question was fair &amp; not out of line ?????? I wasn't negative just wanted to know why they pour over on blond Roast . I owned restaurants for 25years plus . I don't believe I was out of line for ask ?????
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Nov 14, 2018~Tylar @ this location is always on top of it and recently when he was the only one working and had quite a few orders to make and people in line, I asked him if it would take more than ten mins bc I had to get to work and he said probably but I can do yours first and he did and I was able to make it to work with 2 minutes to spare.  Thank you Tylar!
Peoria, AZ 85382~5~Mar 20, 2019~Mel needs a serious promotion. Perfect drinks, impeccable customer experience, and she always has an amazing attitude. I asked her for something u inquest and adventurous; she complied. She concocted the best drink I ever had from a Starbucks and no other location can match her prowess.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Feb 22, 2021~SB that is well located on 7th St. just south of Camelback. The indoor seating area is nice and large but a big negative is they're still not allowing indoor seating.Service was excellent, fast and accurate.This is an above avg starbucks but the seating issue is a problem as they also removed the outdoor chairs.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Mar 23, 2021~I have been to this Starbucks many times as I work right down the block. Although it's a convenient location, I will be looking elsewhere for my morning stop. I've had more than one encounter with this location not filling their cups. This morning after spending almost $20, two of the venti iced coffees were missing a good amount. I'm paying the price of a venti and receiving the amount of a grande. Last time I brought coffee to work for some of my coworkers, the tall latte was missing  about 1/3 of it. Seriously? Not a way to do business, being cheap and screwing your customers. I've had to speak with the manager on shift in the past and clearly nothing has changed. Find a different location!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Dec 21, 2023~Starbucks is my go to. I love that I can get my favorite caffeinated drink and it is made with care. I just need to remember that not all Starbucks make the drinks the same which means you have to order it as always but make sure you add the most important things so it gets pretty close to what your taste buds crave.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~May 14, 2023~They need to work on their drive through speed. We frequently get stuck for long periods of time. But yesterday was the worst. About 3:30pm there were two cars a head of me, and I did not get my drink/get to the window until 3:55pm If they are running that far behind they need to move cars to the front parking spaces and keep the flow going. Or make a way to leave the drive through if needed.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~4~Jul 8, 2019~When I went in, there was no one in line. But, most of the tables were occupied. I quickly ordered a pink drink and sat at one of the long tables. There were a couple other customers at the table. One of them kept looking at me whenever I sat down or got up from the table. I wanted to go to the bathroom to wash my hands, but there was someone in there so I had to wait. Once I had my drink, I took a sip and it was delicious. There was a lot of ice in it. I was able to finish it fairly quickly. While I eat slow, I drink fast. Since Starbucks offers free refills in the form of green tea, black tea, white tea, or passion tea, I was thinking to get a white tea refill. I remember thinking that the black tea and white tea have a slightly fruity flavor like the passion tea. The white tea is less strong than the black tea. They also offer plain coffee as a refill too. The employees were very nice and provided excellent customer service. The restaurant was clean too.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~2~Feb 23, 2022~Dirtiest Starbucks I've ever been in.  Has a cool layout but the bathroom and the front is kinda a mess.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~Jan 21, 2022~Long lines always. Sometimes they turn mobile ordering off completely. Often out of basic supplies such as cups and straws. The manager seriously needs to get their act together with inventory.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Feb 3, 2023~I frequent this Starbucks location way more than I'd like to admit....and every single time I visit, the staff is so unbelievably friendly. The service is fast and I really feel like an appreciated customer whenever I stop by. Typically it's not too busy, unless it's after Xavier (across the street) gets out, then it's swamped, but that's okay! Great hiring choices Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Sep 18, 2023~This is considered a Fast Coffee/food service which is not. I do not know how much time do someone needs to warm up a loaf of bread but some people take to long. Do not tip it, they take more time to do the things
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Jan 18, 2023~I love this location because of the seating arrangement and the large patio BUT let me tell you about the customer service.....!Gabby was the barista that took my order this morning. Formerly a black coffee-only drinker, I'm on a mission to craft my `"Starbucks order`" - something considered part of your identity as an American.She greeted me with a smile and I told her what I liked already and she guided me toward new variations to try. She educated me on blonde roasts and challenged me to try a different syrup all with the safety net of `"we will gladly make it again if you don't like it!`" I loved it! I have a new `"Starbucks order`" and it was the best customer experience I've had at a Starbucks. Ever.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Jun 13, 2023~I pais for my coffe and qaited for lo g time to be prepared. A couple of people went after me and they were served while I was in fro t of them waiting for my coffee. Then, I asked the bar guy what happened with my coffee and he started to give me an attitude and he said `"what?...I already made it (and he did not) but I'll make it again. Then he prepared and it was only water with milk tasting horrible. I qould suggest you not to come to this Starbucks. Customer service sucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Jul 11, 2019~I go to Starbucks almost every day in different locations, and this by far is the best Starbucks I have been to. The drive thru service is SUPER quick. I ordered what I wanted, paid as soon as I got to the window, and they handed my drink right away. I didn't even spend more than three minutes there! Even with the cars in front of me, they got their orders right away as well. I was really really impressed by this location! Their employees are very friendly as well. A+++++ all in all. :)
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Mar 22, 2022~They get orders wrong and then blame you. After you repeat it twice and manager gets attitude. Horrible service! They aren't friendly. Seriously the one on 7th Ave and Osborn and 7th Ave and Missouri are way better. This one is not created equal!!!T
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Aug 23, 2018~Visited the new Starbucks Coffee today at the corner of 7th St &amp; Highland Avenue near Xavier College Prep today.  This new location has a huge patio facing 7th Street, a drive-thru, mobile order and pay, nitro cold brew, google wifi and food options available.  The proximity to Brophy College Prep, Xavier College Prep and the rush hour traffic on 7th Street will make this a hot spot for many years to come.Ordered a small hot coffee of the Pike Place brew for myself.  There is a small menu of available drinks, unlike the Starbucks of the past that had a very large menu.  I'm pretty sure that they can make almost anything and customize it just for you.  I sat outside for a little while, still to muggy and hot in August for me.  Moved inside and sat for about an hour reading, `"The Four Agreements`" by Don Miquel Ruiz.  Great book and simple reading.  There were many other meetings, conversations and interactions going on.  The space is clean and modern, with many different seating arrangements to choose from.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~Aug 23, 2020~Drinks were fine, service good. Nice spacious patio which was available to use while the inside was closed due to Covid. Rating 3 stars because they don't recycle. It's 2020...everyone should be required to recycle but Starbucks contributes A LOT to the waste with so many disposable cups. STARBUCKS - PLEASE BE BETTER.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Jan 27, 2023~Thank you!!! For making me a pour over without pushback because drip is too burnt when I buy it most times. Pleasant employees and even brought my drink to my car for methanks guys, have a great day!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Oct 13, 2022~Fast and super friendly service! There was a long line early this morning, but it moved very quickly. I ordered ahead and everything was ready to go as soon as I approached the drive-thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Jan 21, 2022~Wonderful Staff today and everyday! Seemed a bit busy this afternoon when I stopped for coffee in the drive-thru @11:54 AM. I was thanked for my patience, but instead thanked them for working. Thank you again for the great service with what you could offer.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~2~Apr 3, 2020~I asked for No Foam, the cup says No Foam, so why is a 1/4 of my $6 coffee Foam? Even if I  wanted foam that's excessive.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Apr 16, 2021~Worst location EVER! The `"supervisor`" Leigh was so incredibly rude for no reason. She blamed me that she made my order wrong, saying she had just got there. I am sorry but what does that have to do with anything? Then told me those were the only two drinks I ordered- wrong I ordered 3. When I asked where it was she said they were making it. Like if you hate your job, get a new one.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Jan 5, 2021~Gotta give some recognition to Monique. I believe she is a shift lead. Her customer service today on 1/5 was fantastic! she completely went out of her way to help me. She was genuine, kind, friendly and knowledgeable when it came to products and stock. This was the most pleasant Starbucks interaction I've had in a very very long time and as a former partner I really want to make sure she is recognized. She truly embodies the high quality and superb standard Starbucks sets for their partners to obtain and also give to their customers. Because of her service this is now going to be my home Starbucks instead of one of the 4 locations that are closer to my home. Well worth the extra driving for this quality of service. Well done girlfriend. Well done!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Nov 19, 2021~I will never again in my life go to that Starbucks again or even order from there! not 1 but 2 strawberry's were rotten and made me feel bad the whole morning. I had to leave work in order to go get checked out at the doctors so make sure I'm fine.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~2~Feb 22, 2022~Please retrain the baristas at this location, drinks are weird and inconsistent. Have come here multiple time and it is always bad. I can get the same drink at other locations and they taste the almost the same, but definitely not this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Aug 4, 2019~I came in at this location for the first time as I had some studying to do and wanted to get a coffee and sit and focus.Carrie was the cashier and Carrie was so very......My caramel Frappuccino was excellent I will definitely be back to this location
Phoenix, AZ 85014~2~May 2, 2023~usually like this place, even when it's super packed with high school kids. needed a pick-me up before my last series of classes and went over but they had locked the doors 15 minutes before close. it's not a huge grievance, just an annoyance. also, i'm hungry. . .
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Sep 4, 2020~This is the absolute worst Starbucks in central Phoenix. If you do mobile order don't trust anything their app says because it will say it has it in stock and then you get there and it's out. They only offer 2 vegetarian breakfast options and of course they are out of both. It is up to the baristas to mark things out of stock. When I ask to speak to a manager he comes over, doesn't even ask what's wrong. He immediately says that they are out of stock and if there is anything else I wanted which is the same thing the other barista asked me. I said no and wanted to explain that this happens every time I come here. He says multiple times in a condescending voice `"I'm sooo sorry`" like 3 times in a row. I get it, you probably hear this from people multiple times a day but it's the first time it happened to me today so treat me and the experience like it was the first time it has happened. You are in customer service and customers deserve better service and someone who actually cares to take the feedback to create a better experience for the customer in the future. By the way, being this has happened multiple times, I have contacted corporate before and asked for the DM to call me and that was even beyond the DM to pick up the phone. Clearly the leadership in this market is a reflection of the horrible service that exist in the stores.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Feb 11, 2022~i hate this starbucks. i show up to get my morning coffee before my 5:30 practice for lacrosse and she ignores me and keeps the door locked. they are supposed to open at 5 and they are annoying
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Jan 3, 2022~They close their lobby at 5:30 on a normal non holiday Monday. It's not posted anywhere in the store they just kick you out.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~2~Feb 21, 2020~This Starbucks is always out of my first or even second choice drink options every time I come.. always tons of problems internally keeping stock of things in general. I have resorted to just ordering plain latte so hopefully they at least have that. Wish they would stop apologizing for not having want customers want and just keep it in stock.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Oct 3, 2019~This is my favorite Starbucks because it's a drive thru, it's in a great location, and the baristas are friendly. I always get quick service here, and the coffee is good... for Starbucks, at least. The inside is remodeled too, so it's cozy to sit. My only complaint is that after a certain point in the afternoon, almost always the protein boxes and/or salads/wraps are gone. I've come twice to get a mid-afternoon protein snack and they are fully out.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Jun 29, 2022~male employee working now around 1-2 pm is the sweetest I have ever met! he checks on people sitting down to see how they are doing and if they need anything, is always cleaning and on top of it all. made great conversation which i feel like is rare nowadays with cashiers! love coming here during my lunch because he always has a smile on and is super friendly!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~Sep 18, 2021~The staff is consistent and very friendly. This location is next to 3 large high schools so it can get crazy  busy at times! Even when it is busy they usually are able to keep up and make consistently good drinks. I will say that whoever has been in charge of the music might be hard of hearing. The music has been so loud that I feel like I'm yelling my order at the baristas. Its hard to have a conversation with the music blaring and forget trying to concentrate on doing homework or any kind of paperwork. Between the volume of the music and everyone around yelling to be heard, staying and doing homework is no longer an option here at this location for me.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Jun 30, 2019~Great coffee, really liked the chocolate muffins .The decor of the cafe was also really good and had great vibes.The location was spacious, providing a feeling of liberty, the selection backdrop music was modern and has been in the ideal decibel.Food was yummy and in generous part.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Jun 9, 2021~Went in at 8am for just for a cold brew waited 20 mins.  3 people who ordered after me got their drinks before I did and multiple drinks too. I asked the barista about my drink who took my order with my name and Said there were orders before me . I didn't say anything besides okay . Sat down waited, waited. He came over to the drinks  then  Kept calling out Lori Lori . Proceeded to say Lori this is your order . I asked before hand with my name like I said when I first ordered . Lori is not my name . How would I have known that's not my name . cold brew is a popular drink. Thanks from Lori .
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~May 13, 2021~Friendly, but they are constantly out of ingredients they could surely get at any local grocery store.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Oct 9, 2019~Seriously this review is way overdue. I went in about a month or so ago and Andrea was there to take my order. I asked her a couple questions about the menu and I asked if they had a specific cup I was looking for. She's so easy to talk to and she was so helpful. I had asked about the pink drink and she called the other barista Jeremy over. He said that's his favorite drink and even made me a tall one to try! Such great people work here, I've never been to a Starbucks where you can tell that they genuinely love their job!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~3~Nov 18, 2018~Across the street from Xavier and Brophy, I was correct in my guess that it would be best to stop in here on a Sunday morning rather than a weekday afternoon. This is a spacious location with plentiful seating and several areas for larger groups of 10-12 to gather as well as a long sofa type area in the center surrounded by low bistro tables for solo duo trio type seating. It doesn't have that quaint coffee house kinda feeling here but is more like being at a Panera or maybe even reminds me of IKEA. There's a really large covered outdoor patio with lots of room which would be a great place to study on a warmer day. Not that we get that cold here in metro Phoenix but in the middle of November I'm happy to  stay inside and sip on some Christmas  blend brew. I would've given this stop 4 stars  but no cinnamon or vanilla in the shakers so I can't make a Vienna. Aside from that it's the usual reliable Starbucks experience. Friendly staff and consistent menu.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Feb 10, 2019~Nice staff,Efficient and Remembers our names! Always cheerful!My daughter and I stop every morning before school she always remembers our order and our names!
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Aug 27, 2019~I came in here for an interview and the first thing I was asked was if I wanted anything to drink and I replied with `"waters fine`" the manager then came out; and let me remind you it's about 10:50am almost 11:00am and for some reason it was so busy that there was no privacy for my one on one interview with the manager, I mean for Christ sake there wasn't even a chair between the manager and  some random on her laptop sitting next to her! I would have rather taken the interview outside, on the patio, in the heat, where it was completely empty. Let's just say I did horrible on my interview due to the lack of privacy and how uncomfortable and nervous I was being as there was no chance for me to Build a connection with the manager. Oh and they NEVER brought me my drink that they had offered me which I felt made the whole thing even more UNPROFESSIONAL. (good thing I didn't ask for tall iced chai with soy, and didn't get it. I heard that was a trick question they ask you, so again good thing I asked for water; THAT I NEVER GOT) So the interview ended and I was so mortified I couldn't have gotten out of there any faster.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Aug 1, 2020~Fred helped me out he was amazing !!! Deserves a raise for sure !!! I had a lot of questions he answered them very politely and helped me choose an amazing drink Fred is the man
Phoenix, AZ 85014~1~Mar 19, 2020~Very rude employee.  I went through the drive and the girl at the window was beyond rude to me for no reason.  It wasn't busy at all, she seemed like she hated her job and was upset that she had to go to work.  I will choose somewhere else to get my coffee
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Aug 25, 2018~Nothing but love for them. Lola, Ty, etc.... they're all good people work positive vibes.
Phoenix, AZ 85014~5~Oct 21, 2019~Excellent staff and perfect temp on muffin and pumpkin spice latte, the manager was especially helpful.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jul 27, 2022~Friendly &amp; quick service. One of the cleaner stores I've been to while in AZ. There's not ample seating space in which you have to navigate a tad bit, yet overall a good visit. I'm happy more items are launching that are plant-based. Although I don't drink coffee, the craving for the speciality lemonades is a high note. The Baristas works well together especially in keeping the line moving.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Apr 2, 2024~WORST EXPERIENCE EVER , LACEY IS THE FRONT CASHIER WHO ALWAYS SOME HOW TAKES MY ORDER BUT HAS AN ATTITUDE EVERYTIME I COME IN . I ordered a refresher and cake pop I almost spent half my lunch break here waiting for just a cake pop  that is already made . I proceeded to ask about my cake pop and she just lashes saying HOLD ON . I was being very polite and Patient and I felt very disrespected, no good costumer service here and I seen a roach crawling on the floor , I didn't want to ask for a refund because I was already wasted . DONT EVER COME HERE
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Aug 28, 2021~This is a great SB location in a big shopping center with no drive thru.The seating area is kind of awkward with not enough seats. There's a nice back patio but a security guard was too aggressive thinking maybe I was loitering when I was a paying customer(there are aggressive homeless in the area though).Staff is above average.Recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Feb 11, 2024~Ashley is a gem at this location! She is so patient and kind and I'm glad i ordered what I got because of her! Thanks Ashley :)
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jan 19, 2022~Girl with pink hair (cashier) got my order wrong. Instead of asking barista to remake my order she put a new order in the system and said I  had to wait in line for the customers who came in after me to get my drink made again. Ridiculous!! I asked her if she could just add the classic syrup to my drink and she said no because she had already placed new order.Got my drink made again a second time and yeah , they made it wrong  the second time!! I asked to speak to manager ..he was nice but should of offered something to compensate me for making my drink 3 times !Terrible scarce and uncomfortable seating too.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Feb 8, 2023~You know, something I love about Starbucks is that they sell Evolution cold pressed juice which is simply delicious. I also tried a cappuccino but didn't really enjoy it. There is a lot of open space at this location; you'd think there would be more chairs and tables for people lounge around.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Feb 13, 2024~I love eating a bagel cooked with no cream cheese. I wish they would at least ask. It's nice inside though.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 14, 2023~i am a fellow starbucks partner and i am a shift leader and have been for 2 years. most of the workers at this location are out of dress code and wear their hair down with no hair net. Marissa specifically was extremely rude and was visibly complaining about having to make drinks and when we asked her take ice out of our drink (she made it with lots of ice and we asked for light ice) she was very rude and dumped my drink. when she handed out my new one she put it on the other side of the counter so that i had to walk to the other side even though i was standing in front of her. trinity was wearing a skirt and when she bent down i could practically see up her skirt. there were multiple partners that should have been sent home because of dress code standard.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Nov 19, 2021~This review is based on multiple visits to this location. The past three times I have ordered coffee from this location, it has been a long wait, and when I receive my coffee the cup is half empty? Today's visit was particularly nuts. There were so many people waiting for their mobile orders. My mobile order was almost ten minutes late from the approximate wait time. This is not to knock the staff by any means, the staff has always been wonderful! I do believe they may be understaffed, and maybe need more appliances to make their coffee? That way they can focus more on order accuracy. It is very disappointing having to wait SOOOO long for a half full coffee. Please note: I only come to this location of Fridays, so maybe Fridays are always crazy.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Sep 7, 2023~They opened at 8 i got there at 820 and the only girl working was on her break? Like y'all JUST opened. I'm the only one standing there. Ridiculous.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Apr 18, 2023~The one with `"MJ`" written on her apron took my order and opened the restroom for me. Her face had no expression. Bad customer service. All business. Did not like it. Made me uncomfortable because it made me not want to be here or order here. But the guy with the long hair and glasses was very upbeat and NICE! The guy made a great impression. I know a lot of people that would love that ladies job and appreciate it more than she does. That's all I gotta say! After one visit here.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Aug 26, 2020~In these extreme temperatures I love to stop at Starbucks and indulge in an iced refresher the barista always shake the mixture perfectly, always good customer service and short wait times. Thanks for jeeping me hydrated...
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Feb 22, 2022~We came here on Friday and I tried their yogurt parfait for the first time. It was pretty good. We didn't have to wait very long to get out food/drinks and everyone was friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Nov 30, 2022~They have no sense or urgency, they'll chat and stand around  while there's 16 people waiting for their orders. It also seems that if you just walk in and order at the counter they seem to get it sooner from what I saw. The gentleman with the tattoos just turns around and makes the drink. Seems a bit backwards to me. I don't work here so I don't know how they work but it just looks bad from the customers perspective when we've been waiting 15-20 min for our coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jul 22, 2023~I been going to many star bucks and this one is always a problem , burns my macchiatos ,always rude workers , drinks take at least 15 mins to get . This time an older lady said they charge extra for whip cream on a Carmel macchiato when every location I been to over the whole United stage never had a problem or told me anything like that . Just sounds bitter and then tried argueing my other drink . Just shouldn't be a employee for a company that usually has good happy employees .
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jul 20, 2023~Went to this Starbucks with my friend to get a few drinks and we noticed they were a little busy which we understand with the extremely hot weather. The only nice/friendly employee was the young girl who took our order at about 10-10:15 AM on July 20. We had ordered our drinks and I needed to use the restroom, so I had waited until the worker was handing out drinks to ask for the restroom code when she decided to not even look at me and then she continued to make drinks and go `"there's only two of us, you'll have to wait`" and walked away. I totally understand being busy and stressed but to not even acknowledge the customers and to just walk away/not answer questions isn't a great look. Once the nice young lady who took our order was able to open the restroom for me, the girl who I asked for the code just points and goes `"the restrooms that way`" still without looking at me. My friend then proceeded to mention how the girl on the bar was talking about Karen's and customers in a rude way and speaking under her breath when I had walked to the bathroom. I am thoroughly disappointed with this interaction/Starbucks as I completely understand being stressed and busy because I also work in a coffee shop, but to treat customers like that is frustrating when I was trying to be as polite and nice as possible.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 21, 2023~If I could give no stars I would... how many bad reviews of terrible customer service does this store have to get before they do something about it? I've literally never felt so disrespected getting a coffee especially when I used to work for Starbucks myself.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Apr 22, 2022~On the 22 of April 509pm inter in stardust. And order a drink and coffie with stiva. The young guy was ride throwing thing around. Slamming  thing got scared. All I ask was a coffie with stevia. Omg. Scary experience I ever had he should not work there. I need a apology from star bust. My Gmail is dallara8182@gmail.com. my being a first time customer. Got so scard.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 20, 2022~Stopped over and ordered a drink 'kids temp' (aka Starbucks speak for not massively burn your mouth hot) because I had to drink it quickly on the fly. Instead of kids temp.. or even regular temp which is drinkable after a moment.. it appears the barista instead chose to heat it to such a high temp that it's still not drinkable after having the drink for 20 minutes. Highly unimpressed.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jun 27, 2020~Super nice employees but very inexperienced..like VERY. I went and spent over 30$ on 5 drinks. and each one except for the tea had something wrong or missing. I've never experienced a Starbucks order being messed up so badly and it was so weird because the caramel mach I asked for two and they completely left out caramel on one. Then the caramel ribbon crunch has no caramel when they are promoting it in store with a huge picture. It just tasted like a vanilla bean frap. On top of that it took 20 minutes and we were the only ones in store and everyone who came in after us got there drinks before us. Just a very odd experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Apr 14, 2018~1.  Ordered the eggs with Gruyere and spent 5 minutes arguing with the older, blonde barista that kept insisting I was ordering something else.  The manager had to get involved.2.  My drinks were delivered, name called, no eggs. 3.  Wait 20 min still no eggs4.  Go to counter, ask for eggs he says `" they were here the whole time`" and attempts to hand me 20 minute old eggs.5.  He then tells the manager and she handles the situation appropriately and apologizes for his behaviorThe one star is because the manager is five star but the employees suck
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jul 30, 2015~Have outdoor seating in the front and the back of the store. The seating in the area I was in at 7:30am was extremely cluttered with trash under the tables. You would think in 2 and a half hours someone would of cleaned it up as they open at 5:00am. My drink was as expected. The service inside was good and everyone was very friendly. Inside of store was clean and orderly. The outdoor seating is a nice area minus the garbage. Plenty of tables, kind of a garden setting. Wish there was a Starbucks in my area set up like this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~May 20, 2017~Always check your drink before you leave!!! I usually do because what I order- venti iced Carmel macchiato, usually always gets messed up. My biggest issue is somehow it tastes like all milk and no coffee. So yesterday I did mobile order. Grabbed my drink and left. As I'm driving I tart to mix and it's pure milk. Starbucks is so expensive, I drove back and had them make me a new drink. The barista said she made it right?.. but second time around was perfect. I now just always need to make sure I'm checking my drink!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 6, 2014~They have the Clover machine if you want that. We came in the back door not realizing it, as we are new to the area. The configuration of the store is long with a couple of long tables, several two person tables but just two big comfortable chairs. One door out the back and one door out the front toward the street. Plenty if parking, front or back.Incredible selection in the food cabinet!Not sure to whom this location is catering, but it was super busy this Sunday morning! The baristas seemed friendly particularly to the locals (a firefighter and a woman who appeared to work nearby). I have made it a goal to try every Starbucks in our neighborhood. This one had great coffee, but just not the relaxing environment that we are looking for to enjoy our coffee and linger over a good book. Might be back if my wife and I are shopping nearby in the Last Chance (I don't really like that store) and need a coffee fix.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Apr 4, 2021~I only picked 5 stars  so people would see this.  I refuse to buy anything  from Starbucks anymore due.to the fact they do not support our troops.  Who defends your right to have your restaurants? Without the troops,  we would not be a land of the free that everyone  wants to be in.  SHAME, SHAME SHAME ON STARBUCKS!  I will never buy anything from you again!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 7, 2022~Connor you need better training! You spilled the coffee everywhere. You gave me coffee that was missing everything.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Dec 19, 2020~This location is the worst.  The don't listen when they take your order.  When you get the wrong order and try to ask them about it, they are rude.  Skip Starbucks altogether and go to Cartel. Locally owned, waaay better coffee, and better customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Dec 4, 2021~I placed my order and the person who took my order was really nice. There was one barista being rude to every customer walking up to her to ask questions about their drinks. One customer asked for a cup holder she grabbed the cup holders handed one to the customer and slammed the rest down on counter and broke something off the plastic shield protector. Then she walked away. Another customer came in and asked her that she took something off her order and didn't mean to, she just rolled her eyes and walked away. A young guy making drinks said I can help you. She was the rudest barista ever and doesn't deserve to be there with that attitude! She has her hair pulled back in a pony tail, blonde and under 25 years old. Rude customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 4, 2017~This particular Starbucks is fairly large. There is ample space for sitting around and tons of people working on their laptops at this location! Very roomy, wide selection, and fast service.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Sep 14, 2019~This is a chill spot if you're in need for decent coffee. The location is convenient if your significant other is shopping across the street and you are in need for a place to relax. The seats are clean and the workers do a wonderful job of keeping the place tidy. As with other Starbucks locations, the bathrooms have locks. And for some reason, just as other locations, the workers will not give out the passwords; rather, they will walk you to the bathroom and unlock it for you. This is somewhat of a pet-peeve of mine.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 22, 2019~Seriously. The rudest barista ever! I was a partner once and OMG I would never act like that.! It wasn't busy- but Amy clearly wasn't have a good Tuesday!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Feb 26, 2018~I redeemed my birthday drink via mobile order for this location. It was ready in the amount of time quoted, but I was beyond displeased to see tht my cup was NOT AT ALL FULL. Astounding how someone would bother to serve a drink with about a fifth of it missing.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Nov 2, 2010~This Starbuck's is located in a little stip mall smashed between Zoe's Kitchen and an Einstein's bagels.  I come here in the morning on the way into work because its close to my job and its good reliable coffee.I've been going to Starbucks for years, and I'm starting to become a regular here.  It's not my favorite one, for a variety of different reasons.  First, seating here is awkward.  Inside, they have one really long table, a couch, and like 2 small tables.  More of a group oriented seating arrangement then bunches of individual tables.  They do have ample outdoor seating, but I don't always feel like sitting outside.The service here is fine, but nothing exceptional.  I'm not moved by it, especially since I'm here in a very regular basis.  The staff is nice, but not as nice as others I have been to.My only formal complaint is that half the time I go in here, thier out of half and half.  At 7AM.  I get tired of having to walk the container back and forth to the counter at least 1 day a week, usually more.  I know the baristas are busy, but there's nothing worse then waiting in line twice.  Once for your coffee order and another time while the barista finishes waiting on 3 other customers before he can get to the empty creamer.I mean, I do have good days in here, but its always the same 2 or 3 issues that they fail on when I'm in here.  Generic service, running out of essential supplies, and limited seating indoors.  I mean, I know seating is seating, but it gets frustrating sometimes when I want to sit down at 7AM to eat my muffin and Ive got to tough it out in the summer when its scortching hot and I'd rather be in the AC...I guess I've had better experiences at Starbucks throughout the valley that I can say these things as comparisons to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~May 8, 2012~I was not impressed by this Starbucks.I went every day during my PHX trip, and my drink was made incorrectly EVERY time. And then I was given attitude when I asked for it to be fixed- My drink doesn't even need to be remade to be fixed, just needs some classic syrup added. Also, on one of the days, they were out of receipt paper. And instead of telling me, the cashier walked away. I was still at the register when she came back. That's when I found out...
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 13, 2019~Omg! The BathRoom is very disgusting there is shit everywhere. The Starbucks people should check there bathroom every hour.Both bathrooms  Had shit on top of the toilet set and in side the toilet splatter every were. Plus in front of the toilet to dangling down the seats and go into the floor. For a high class area I feel disgusting and if these people use the bathroom to go and they serve my for drinks and food that's cross-contamination you guys should be shut down for filth if I get sick from my drink there be a lawsuit! Not a happy customer!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Nov 14, 2012~This Starbucks is a bigger place than the ones I normally go to.  And everyone there has a laptop, ipad, or holding something electronic.  I felt the need to take out my cell phone and hold it.  he he he...  Everyone (customers and employees) are friendly.  They got the order spot on.  When we were leaving there was a GOOD dog sitting by the door with his leash not tied to anything just waiting for his owner.  Awwwwww....
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jul 21, 2018~I like this location. They don't have a drive thru so they're able to complete orders faster than most. Every time I mobile order here, it's ready for me when I walk in, and I live right around the block. Another big plus of this location is that they've never once screwed my orders up!  That's saying a lot, considering I've pretty much come to expect that from most other locations.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 20, 2017~I'll keep this short and sweet.It's a Starbucks so there's not much to say there. Free wi-fi, standardized drink/food selections, and lots of parking. Awesome.1 star because the barista who rang me up was really rude - eye rolls/heavy sighs/impatience and all. Won't be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Mar 29, 2018~Way too long a wait. The morning rush crowd was not moved quickly enough. This is high traffic area and they could do with 1 more microwave.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Apr 14, 2018~The coffee tasted water down and the guy was rude kept saying well I can't hear you over an over instead of saying I can't hear you please pull forward
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Nov 25, 2016~Worst Starbucks drinks I've ever had. Husband got a latte, I got a Chai, we actually couldn't tell which was which from taste testing. Both just tasted like hot water with foam. Seriously bad drinks.Why 2 stars, not 1? The employees were nice and friendly. I'm sure they would have tried to fix them. We didn't realize the drinks were terrible until we left and we weren't going back just to get new, bad drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 12, 2019~5am and this old lady is BLASTING STARBUCKS EARVOMIT RADIO! Make it stop! Even asked her to turn it down completely ignoring the request this is horrendous!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 11, 2018~Quick &amp; easy - but darn that parking lot - I really wish there was a mobile order parking space out front...
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Aug 7, 2010~I stopped by at this Starbucks today for the first time in about 6 months and was pleasantly surprised by the neat transformation of their interior decor. I think they changed the flooring from large tiles to textured wood flooring. They now have several big comfy leather sofas and very organic wooden tables. The seating arrangements create a sense of community and right-at-home atmosphere.Great customer service. I'll definitely start coming here more often!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 5, 2016~People bring in their stupid dogs all the time. They don't seem to give a crap about anyone else. Morons. When speaking to the staff, they don't seem to care. I saw a lady with an infant step over the dog. So she can sit. The owner of the dog didn't look the least bit concerned.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 3, 2016~People bring in their stupid (non service) dogs all the time. They don't seem to give a crap about anyone else. I saw this guy with his Doberman just sitting there. A family of 4 with their infant child came in and sat at the table next to him and he didn't even try to move the dog. The lady had to step OVER the dog with child in hand. Upon asking the staff about policy they said they didn't care that the dog was there. Law definitely needs to change to certify service dogs. It's disrespectful to those who actually need them. In the meantime, avoid this store, unless you are a dog nutter.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Nov 15, 2012~I have been to a lot of Starbucks and I thought this Starbucks was really clean and it was pretty big inside too.  This year I got a free drink for my birthday.  I was pretty excited about it, because Starbucks is one of my favorite places to go for coffee.  So, when I went up to order my Chocolate Cookie Crumble Frappuccino.  The cashier was really friendly and wrote Happy 30th Birthday Amy on my cup.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Nov 22, 2015~The local `"fancy`" Starbucks.  They feature Reserve coffee and are on the list to be one of the first Starbucks Evenings stores.  They also are one of the locations to sell the 2015 limited edition sterling silver and Swarovski Crystal gift card key chain.There isn't a lot of comfortable seating, but there are several long communal tables that would work well for groups.I've had really good customer service here, and the parking is SO MUCH better than many of the tiny drive-through Starbucks peppering the city.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jun 20, 2018~I stop at a Starbucks location everyday and wanted to check out this store on my way to work. I walked up, said good morning, asked the older blonde barista how she was doing, and she didn't even smile when she cut me off, `"What can I get you...`" Everyone in this store seemed like they were irritable and hadn't had their coffee yet this morning. Sorry to say that I won't  be stopping here again.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 23, 2011~This is probably my favorite of all the Starbucks in town when it comes to the look and feel of what a Starbucks should be.  Years ago this was a typical Starbucks, but recently they remodeled it and the look is just perfect for what SB is.  The staff is great and insanely nice.  If you need anything, they are more than happy to help and assist.  Of course making sure the drinks taste great is important too and I've never been disappointed.I work close to this location, so its on my way to work.  Love it here.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Nov 17, 2011~This was the first place I stopped in Phoenix when I arrived from driving across the country.  It's in a fairly good location off Camelback, near good shopping. The employees here are nice enough, but the inside of this Starbucks is tight on space. The parking outside is even worse. They make a pretty good Salted Caramel Mocha, but taken as a whole this isn't my favorite SBUX location in town.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Nov 8, 2013~This is my go-to Starbucks, mostly because it's on my way to work. Everyone there is friendly, polite and seems to know what they're doing. Even when the line is out the door these ladies (and the occasional gentleman) do a top-notch job of taking orders quickly. My name gets misspelled occasionally, but it's a tougher name to spell. My only real complaint is please please keep the delivery counter area wiped up and dry as much as possible. Half the time I order a croissant/pastry it gets placed in drink spillage which soaks through the paper, making the croissant soggy and harder to transport in the car, (and also, not worth the price.) I understand it gets busy, but for the prices charged and the otherwise high standards, this small improvement would make a HUGE difference.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jul 17, 2016~This location has some rude employees and slow service, probably as a result of being understaffed. I walked in on a Saturday afternoon and there were only two people behind the counter. They were moving slow, barely communicating with each other. There were only two people ahead of me in line and I ordered a cold brew coffee (and a smoothie for my mom). Not the most labor-intensive order, but it still took about 10 minutes. And when I got my cold brew, it was 80% creamer. I asked for a little more coffee. The guy begrudgingly helped me out. Just go to the one on 7th St and Missouri if you can. They've got a drive-thru and you don't have to feel like a burden on someone's day.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Mar 31, 2017~Literally the slowest Starbucks on the planet.  15 minutes to get my cold brew.  Nuts.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jul 23, 2011~I go to this starbucks because it is close to the house.  The coffee is alway consistent, but if you ever see a promotion in the newspaper some staff has not been aware of the promotion.  Starbucks overall needs to contact their stores and put up in store signs if they are having a promotion.   Nothing worse than going to a Starbucks to buy a Via iced coffee pack with an advertised free small coffee and be told that they have not heard of that promotion, although I went home and double checked that I was correct on the promotion days.  It is a nice Starbucks and I go there every once in a while, less lately though.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jan 19, 2012~This is the Starbucks for those of you Big Bang Theory wannabe and jock fans.  It's an interesting mix of customers that hang out here.  Service is hot and cold here.  Weekdays tend to be better, Saturdays service is sketchy as the barristas tend to be apathetic and hung over so you may need patience for that drink.  I showed up on a Saturday with 3 people in front of me and my grande peppermint mocha took 30 minutes.  I showed up on a weekday with 6 in front of me and it took 15.  Rock paper scissors, service consistency is not aligned with other locations.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jul 28, 2019~Ordered through the app to make it to work on time, ended up turning around because the link drink looked separated and curdled. It was overly sweet. All I would've appreciated was her to remake the drink with less syrup. I didn't drink it and paid for a venti. Super bummed they were rude about it. Would much rather go to the one in target right across the parking lot.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 9, 2016~i'm downgrading the Starbucks at Camelback &amp; 16th St to ONE damn star. the homeless problem at this location is so disgusting i won't even go here anymore. very typically about 10-20% of people around and in this location talk and yell to themselves and smell like urine. effing GROSS. homeless people sleeping on the chairs inside and totally setting up shop on the back patio. the bathrooms? i'd sooner use a port-a-potty at any 5-day outdoor music fest. gross gross GROSS. my best/worst memory from this location...after a homeless man sat behind me while i was trying to get work done, he started yelling and telling everyone in the Starbucks about his conspiracy theories. i approached a barista and told him this homeless man was being excessively loud and disrupting people in his area. the young barista looked over and said, `"Oh, that's Carlos, he's cool.`"other than the homeless-loving hippie barista, staff here is ok, pretty standard...although they do mess up orders moreso than a standard Starbucks...which is still good by comparison to most coffee spots. still though: Starbucks Corporate...this location needs MAJOR crisis management.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Oct 15, 2015~this Starbucks is pretty rank. it's overrun with homeless and down-and-outs...the men's bathroom is typically broken or poop-filled and for some reason the sink faucet runs dangerously hot as the ONLY setting. filth, man. just a disgusting location.the back patio is beggar's row. the front patio is just run-down and smushed between a sandwich shop and funky cheap-o bagel joint.this used to be my favorite Starbucks about three years ago (solid staff, good seating, professional clientele). but over time the staff became less caring, the cleanliness became borderline horrendous and the riff raff stink, literally. granted, some of the old staff that does it right remains, and there IS a little pep to their step. but they are overwhelmed by newbies who either don't give a damn or for some reason can't do their job.again, sad since i used to love this location. it NEEDS a manager onsite every day, because right now, the homeless are running the asylum, baby.oh, the coffee and tea? it's a Starbucks- same wherever you go. however at this location it might take a couple tries to get the order right. plop.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 10, 2017~Stopped here on the way to a movie, drank an espresso, the movie was bad. The espresso made my poops easier. Would drink again.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jan 2, 2017~I wasn't impressed with the service. I asked for a venti and they give me a grande. I told them I wanted a venti instead and the barista said she would make me wait before she could give me a venti and I had been waiting 15 mins prior to that since they were having  a huge morning rush. I just left clearly not happy and she didn't try to remedy the situation. I hold Starbucks to a higher level than most coffee shops because they expect you to. They always say how they'll always make it right and they didn't. So needless to say. I won't be going to that location anymore.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Dec 18, 2016~I love Starbucks and haven't found a place that has let me down in the years I've been going to one every single day until this store. I've now been here for the last three months and 1 out of 3 times they have messed up my order. I can definitely understand mistakes as I've worked in the food industry as well as customer service but this many times in not getting simple things right like `"No Whip please`" or `"Dirty Chai`" only to have whip cream or a regular chai tea can be frustrating especially when your morning coffee run is the perk and start of your day. What makes it worse is this seems to happen when they aren't busy and I mean no one in line!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Dec 9, 2011~Of all the Starbucks I've been to in Phoenix -- and I'm Seattle transplant, so I'm always searching for great coffee here in The Desert -- this one has been the best. The staff is always friendly and the lines here -- which there ALWAYS are, probably because the staff is so nice and competent -- are very fast-moving. The inside is tiny, yes, but I always find a spot to plug my laptop in.Compared to the SB on Tatum and the one on Shea across from Whole Foods, where they act like they're doing you the world's biggest favor by taking your order, this Starbucks is great.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Sep 11, 2015~After 6 people behind me got their drinks, I was asked if I was waiting on something. I had to reorder my latte. Apparently my cup was lost???? How does that happen? Terrible location. I waited 15 min and the drink came out absolutely disgusting. Couldn't even drink it.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 10, 2011~This is our new local SBs. The owner/manager and other staff are very nice and friendly.Wonderful place to relax, sip coffee and read or use the wifi.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jun 29, 2013~Starbucks does it in way that price seems normal for just a regular coffee.Make it to look fancy than it really is and we are happy to pay for.On thing we have to take our hats for them, they came and change the coffee history forever!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Feb 9, 2015~My coffee was fine, what I expected. What I didn't expect is to watch and listen to an employee deride my name. I ordered a sandwich, the type of sandwich and my name were written on the bag and then set aside. The woman looked at the bag, made a face, looked at the girl and asked if my name was a new kind of sandwich. The cashier laughed and said she knew how to spell. The other woman made another face and turned away. All of this in front of me. While it may not seem like a big deal, it is exceptionally rude and bothers me for their lack of consideration. Suggestion, read the bag and see the type of sandwich and just make it. People have diverse names, don't make them feel bad for it. Will not be returning to this Starbucks after this.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Feb 29, 2016~I have to say that every time without fail my drink is made perfectly and is ready on time. I use mobile order in the am and always get the hot chocolate. I only gave 4 stars bc there have been times I've come in the evening and my drink is pretty bad but they've been willing to remake in those instances.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~May 2, 2018~I usually stop at thisStarbucks every morning and they're very nice. their staff is very quick and area is next to Biltmore. Love their mobile order. It's in a complex so its not a very big and they're usually busy.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Sep 12, 2015~Service was good and prompt! Staff was nice and this location actually has a nice sitting area with ample space so that's nice!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Nov 24, 2012~Hey, at least the guy didn't ask `"what can we get started for you`". He knew I just wanted coffee. Medium coffee. Thanks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Aug 22, 2012~My favorite Starbucks in AZ so far...  I love the couches!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 7, 2012~My favorite Starbucks in AZ so far...  I love the couches!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 27, 2012~The staff here is very fast, efficient, and friendly and Shawn, the Manager is friendly and professional. This is my favorite Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 29, 2017~I'm  a teacher and I am 100% unable to function without coffee. I'm also, weirdly, a morning person, but again, I am tired. So the point is, is that this is my Starbucks. You know, the one that makes your drink just exactly right? The one that calls you by name and even sometimes has your drink ready before you've walked through the door and to the counter? I zombie-stumble in Monday through Friday and get my caffeine fix before spending some time grading papers and lesson planning. Sure, there are some homeless people now and then, sometimes they ask for money and sometimes they don't. Sure, there's a lady who comes in about once a month to make some announcements about the Toyota dealership nearby - no she doesn't buy anything, just make her announcement and leaves. But also, there is a really wonderful group of regulars and baristas that are there every single day. We all speak, have a good camaraderie, and look out for one another. Being a part of a fantastic early-rising, coffee drinking crew, and getting to have spot-on baristas is a win for me.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~May 24, 2016~This store is totally unorganized. I walked in around 10:30 am to a short line. My order was taken yet I still waited for what seemed like forever. I ordered a panini and a Frap. Sandwich was out rather quick however, it took them yet another 10 mins (I'm being generous) to get my drink to me. There were not that many people in front of me yet, there were at least 7 drinks sitting on the counter with no identified patron to match them up with. While I waited for my beverage, I watched the counter worker continue to place food and beverages on an extremely dirty counter (no bueno). The lack of attention and service leave me with no choice but to rate them a 2. Additionally, the taste of my beverage was absolutely horrible. I've been purchasing the same drink for years (Salted Caramel Frap = Toffee Nut Mocha Frap when not in season on the menu); its not that hard to make since it is a menu item and there is a recipe for it. I was quite disappointed and do not plan on ever going back.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Sep 15, 2014~I believe the cost is too expensive not equal to the services I received. That's all...
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Sep 28, 2014~Beware Barrista Rachel. Perhaps today was just not her day. I stupidly asked for a vente SPL. Uh, I meant PSL. I felt silly and tried to jokingly tell her I know someone we call SPL. SHE CUT ME OFF, with `"Hot or cold....ma'am`". She deflated sails totally on an otherwise really cool Sunday morning.  THEN the barrista who made my drink called me Robert. Oh for the love! I clearly have boobs. I am RobertA! My Sunday now sucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jan 15, 2014~This place is bigger than I realized. Plenty of seating in here if you're planning on bringing your laptop or tablet. Or you can snag a seat at one of the numerous outdoor tables in the front or back of the shop. I only drink black coffee.....can't screw that up! Needless to say, coffee was a-okay in my book!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Nov 26, 2015~These guys at this store are ALWAYS too busy. Starbucks NEEDS to add another store nearby to offset the total people going here. Takes forever to get a coffee, and the bathrooms are never kept up. Not the employees fault... its corporate that needs to do something about it.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Feb 1, 2011~We have all been to Starbucks, and know the deal, so I will just say that the baristas here are super friendly, and the atmosphere is very welcoming.  Plenty of seating, and you will always find an array of people on their computers, reading, etc.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 6, 2010~Yes, it's Starbucks. But these baristas are hands-down the best in the state. Which is saying a lot, because I've been to a lot of Starbucks - obviously. This is a GREAT place to work out of, especially now that AT&amp;T provides free Wi-Fi. :)
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Apr 18, 2013~It's a Starbucks that does Starbucks things... so if you like free WiFi, Starbucks Coffee, Tea or just hanging out, then head on down.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Feb 17, 2014~Love the customer service here. I work across the street so I'm in frequently. Great awesome women, they make the best drinks and know my order when I didn't even ask for it yet! Thanks ladies for making my coffee just the way I like it!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 31, 2015~I come here often because my work is right down the street- I love DREA! She always rings me up and is always courteous and nice! She always makes my experience amazing!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 1, 2011~My favorite staff and environment this is the best buck
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Dec 19, 2012~Bought a grande Coffee of the day last week,It was the Bold Blend they offered.It tasted like water ! What a joke,you guys cant even make a cup of coffee ! And as all starbucks,the bathrooms are filthy and the place smells like sour milk.I know they dont care,they have enough people buying thier crap coffee and adding enough sugar and milk they cant taste the coffee anyway.Good Luck !
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 27, 2012~I was in this Starbucks yesterday and ordered a frappicino. I asked for 2cups to help keep it insulated and frozen longer in this AZ heat and the girl at the register snapped. She first said I could only have a sleeve and the when I said I would pay for the second cup she preceded to tell me how un environmentally friendly I am. How inappropriate and out of line.  I will be sending a letter to their coroporate office
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Aug 3, 2015~Staff is always helpful and smiling, as well as prompt with their service. Most importantly, they never misspell my name ;) only downside is it's usually busy- so the wifi bandwidth is sometimes limited.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Aug 2, 2014~Either they need to hire more baristas or they need to work in faster pace.  I ordered a very simple drink and waited for over 5 minutes for it.  It was also during evening rush hours, but that shouldn't be the reason why my drink took a long time to make.  Not impressed at all.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jul 14, 2014~Came in to the store and no one greeted me even though there were 5 employees on at 8 am. Ordered a venti iced coffee with 2 pumps white mocha instead of the regular pumps of classic and they charged me for a full set of pumps (.60) when I asked why I was being charged, very coldly and dignified, the barista told me it is corporate policy... I responded with I know corporate, I was a partner for 6 years. Personally, I would never have charged for the white mocha seeing that I was not getting the full pumps and I was not getting the classic syrup. Never coming to this one again. I much prefer the stores closer to my house. At my store we made sure to greet every guest when they came in and tried to make a connection with everyone who ordered a drink. If this is the same regional manager as other Starbucks I've been to then they need to know he is not doing a good job. A lot of stores are not gold standard.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Nov 13, 2015~I always love going to starbucks, the service was great here but I would agree it is a pretty dirty location.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jan 26, 2013~Just like any Starbucks. However, it does not have a drive-thru (you'll have to go up a street for one on 16th street and Bethany Home). Often study here and they have lots of tables and chairs near outlets for your laptop. Staff is friendly and quick. Free WIFI is a plus.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jul 24, 2013~Listed as a dog friendly place. NOT. They only allow `"Service Dogs.`" In which is fine. When I brought in a dog from our animal shelter. She was a very friendly dog and very quiet and well behaved. The manager or supervisor was very rude. Obvious she did not like dogs. I understand they have to follow their policies there. She acted like I was suppose to know and looked at the dog as if I brought in this monster. I bought my coffee and left. I don't want to go back there again.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Aug 29, 2013~I just moved here from California and I've enjoyed the places I've visited. Of all the places I've been to, Starbucks is the best. I haven't been to Starbucks as much as I've been here in Phoenix. My family loves coffee so we really enjoy coming to sit down and enjoy having coffee together. The people here are very welcoming and always greet me with a smile. They're service is outstanding and my drink always comes out the way I want it to.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Oct 30, 2022~One of my better SB experiences that's located inside Target. Service is friendly &amp; quick. Not much on the food or merchandise inventory. The prices here were a little cheaper than some of the other interior stores located inside Malls &amp; other retail developments. Yet again, a lot of the inventory was not available.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 22, 2023~Great location! Thank you SO much to Bentley, shift supervisor for saving me from driving away this morning with my pink drink that I had set on top of my car and then forgot was there! If it hadn't been for him running out so politely to stop me - I surely would've have lost my drink and made a huge mess. I really appreciate that he was paying attention when I wasn't. Give Bentley a raise for his attention to detail and customer service skills! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 6, 2023~Literally the sweetest set of baristas! Dulce always is exceptionally kind and attentive! The service was quick and efficient and the only reason I even go to this target! Shout out to the two gals whom were working this afternoon! Thank you for not making my coffee experience transactional and for being welcoming and informative!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Aug 30, 2022~This Starbucks is the best in this area! They make these best drinks, and have efficient and friendly employees.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 27, 2019~Great service, quick to get my drink out &amp; very polite. Love stopping here before my target run
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Nov 19, 2018~Worst baristas and customer service from a Starbucks ever.  Total bitchy attitude.  Lighten up, it's just coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~More than 5 years ago~Located inside Macy's at Biltmore Fashion Park. Not much of retail products or seating are available, yet a good way to grab a drink before you shop. If you enter Macy's from 24th Street, you'll see Starbucks as soon as you walk in.Quick &amp; friendly service.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Nov 26, 2022~I wonder this is not a real Starbucks store--neither customer service nor latte flavor met the expectation.I ordered a Venti size pistachio latte first and later on wanted a add a hot peach tea as a refill--which I have been doing for many times in other locations. The girl stilled charged me full price for the refill tea even though I mentioned clearly to her it would be a refill. Obviously she's chatting with her other teammates and did not pay attention. Upon inquiry(why she did not charge refill price), she rolled her eyes and said impatiently, `"I've never heard about it(the refill policy) before!`"Being at Starbucks Golden status for years, this was the worse customer service I've ever experienced.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jan 15, 2023~This is a below avg Starbucks inside of Macy's. There is very little seating and it's annoying trying to chill with obnoxious Macy's customers and staff prowling around.The shoe dept. is across from the Starbucks counter and I had some annoying Macy's clerk staring at me. Maybe she was expecting me to buy shoes with my coffee. Not recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Nov 28, 2021~Best Starbucks I've ever been to drink quality was absolutely amazing and they got me out of there within 5 minutes BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Sep 27, 2023~The baristas are usually in a bad mood, except the blonde one who works here (she is friendly, hence why I gave two stars). I get it sometimes work can get tiresome, however if you work in customer service at least make an attempt to be somewhat helpful and friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 15, 2022~Not the best location. Baristas are very casual about the beverages they make and making tons of mistakes. After paying nearly $8 for a drink, we were not satisfied with service or the drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jul 16, 2023~Awful service came in with my family one of the barristas was super disrespectful to me in front of my family husband and children. It was a very upsetting experience especially because my children noticed the hostility. I do not recommend coming to this location unfortunately the staff is not very professional.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 6, 2022~I love Macy's and now a Starbuck's inside of a Macy's even better!  It is a small stand inside but they are nice and fast.  They even gave me a drink last time because someone ordered it but did not come back to pick it up.  OK with me!  I always get the same thing venti green ice tea with no sugar.  :)
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jan 9, 2017~This Starbucks is right inside of Macy's. Yep, it is true and it is the same great tasting Starbucks we have grown to love.I have had the pleasure to drop by twice during my long holiday shopping hours. It was nice to see a Starbucks open late during the mad holiday rush hours. This location is staffed properly with four baristas working hard to meet the needs of each patron that needs to be served. It is located in the men's section near the main entrance. Has the same great drinks, treats and food options other Starbucks have. There is even a small dining sections with chairs and a few tables. Sit and shop. They have some unique coffee cups and other fun items to purchase. My service was quick and I was greeted with a smile. I even got a thank you when my service was done. Both times my drinks and food were properly made correctly. I can even use my Starbucks Gold Card.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Dec 28, 2013~Thank you to Megan (aka Elle Woods) and Rebecca- my favorite baristas that always make my day... And drinks!Working in the mall, my team heavily relies on this Starbucks.  Often times we need more than 1 drink carrier or perhaps 2 people to go at once to ensure our order is safely carried back to home base.I'm a fan of the chocolate marble bread and a hot nonfat latte... But the history of favorites could paint a mural.  Don't get me started on holiday drinks!  Also don't think about the sugar!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 23, 2016~Rebecca is by far the sweetest barista ever!! From the first time I met her she remembered my name- so nice in a world of impersonal service.  This Starbucks has all the coffee drinks and teas of other locations but not as much food as other spots.  They still have the pastry case and several grab and go beverage options.After going to the same (different) Starbucks for years Rebecca is the first person to take the time to remember me!  What a gem!  Also one of the blonde girls was sweet to me saying I look just like Drew Barrymore... I'll take it!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~More than 5 years ago~See attached picture... haven't had a sip. Thought the cup felt a little light when i picked it up.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Nov 26, 2018~Pretty bad Starbucks , they always seem to be  understaffed, they take their sweet time making one drink when it's rush hour &amp; have an attitude issue. I would just go to the one across the street.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Sep 11, 2018~Friendly but after driving up 3 levels just to park and get a latte, I mobile it, I get there,  and they tell me they are out of the milk. Jesus H Christ . Now back in the car to find the next Starbucks.  Unhappy, wasting my time and gas to get there.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jul 22, 2017~The staff is friendly enough but obviously inexperienced and unprofessional. Slow, inaccurate and not worth the convenience. If you work at the mall, go across the street to the real Starbucks.As an update to this review I want to iterate that for whatever it's worth this will be my last cent spent here. Raymond is the baristas name that made this decision easy. His rude and unprofessional comment about my workplace and his general attitude towards customers is disgusting. How could an established company such as this door such a poor job hiring?
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Aug 18, 2022~A good dose of cheerful customer service to start your day off. Not much seating at this location.Yet the energetic team works well together in keeping the orders going &amp; the line moving.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jan 20, 2022~They do not make pour overs. I asked for a blond roast and was told they can only make me an americano. Gross.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 11, 2020~Maya was VERY rude - handed me my drinks and I asked her to repeat which drink was which and she didn't even look at me and mumbled it while walking away. Didn't smile once. I got 4 drinks for my coworkers and I asked for a drink carrier and she didn't respond and threw the carrier on the counter. Definitely not customer service- if she hates her job so much she should get a new one.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 18, 2013~Nestled inside of Fry's Marketplace this full service Starbucks offers everything. There is a small dining area with big screen TV's and they offer free Wifi. Not the ideal place to hold a meeting but perfect for local shoppers or employees near by to grab a little something on their lunch break.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Nov 8, 2019~I went here at about 530am with a coworker to get about 5 drinks on Thursday morning.  The lady working looked miserable.  Idk if she was having a bad day but she should at least try faking it.  She pretty much ignored us for a good two minutes.  Yes, she saw us.  She was slamming cups around, talked to us very rudely taking her sweet time.  The line was growing but she kept cleaning and putting cups away with an attitude.  We asked if she had any cheese danishes and she grabbed two off the cart and slammed them in the counter.  It was a very uncomfortable Experience.  Hopefully she is not like this every morning.  She is what people see in the morning.  We go to Starbucks for a pick me up not a Debbie downer.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Sep 23, 2018~Guy at the counter ( name tag said Nick) was huffing and puffing and rolling his eyes non stop like I was inconveniencing him by placing an order. He was incredibly rude and extremely unhelpful. Interrupted me multiple times to say `"we don't have that`" or `"we're out`" and didn't offer substitutions to what I could order. My drink was made incorrectly and was absolutely disgusting. Wasn't sure what he put in it so I ended up tossing it out. Extremely disappointed
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Apr 4, 2017~Enjoy coming to this location while I'm shopping at Fry's or at the other grocery stores across the street. It's rarely busy, but i've always only been in pretty early in the mornings. Service is always great here! They do have TV's nearby and quite a bit of seating inside, considering they are inside a grocery store.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Aug 10, 2017~They get one star due only to the fact that they exist. But that's it. Unbelievably poor customer service.** Adding to this review: Now I want my star back! I had to go back in because my order wasn't correct. I will never come back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Mar 28, 2016~Starbucks. Stopped in to get a couple things and walked out happy with a shaken peach green tea lemonade. This location offers everything the stand alone a do. Service was quick and friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Aug 7, 2017~Michelle the manager was very helpful and made us a new drink when another Starbucks didn't make the drink correctly. A worker originally told us they couldn't remake it but Michelle stepped in and remade it no problem for us. Very professional and the drink was great!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Nov 27, 2015~Horrible horrible customer service! They have one person working early morning and she moves slower than a snail! She hates her job and it shows! She talks down to people she trains.. Starbucks is known for their great customer service and she doesn't have what it takes!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Nov 28, 2022~Hi, I'm Chris and I'm a Starbucks addict. This was my first time at this specific location and won't be my last. There was no line, barista was friendly and quick. I stopped by my house but they were out of Via packets I needed/wanted so I came here on the way to spend time with fam. I'm not sure his name but he was friendly, checked that their location had the product I was looking for and was quick. Got what I came for and left with a smile. Thanks Starbucks! Keep up the excellent work!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~2~Dec 5, 2024~I don't usually go to this store but stopped by to grab a coffee. Staff ignored me when I came in... no line and lots of employees talking to each other behind the counter... I tried to say hi twice and get the attention of the two staff closest to the counter right behind the barista machine who did not even look up or say anything. Finally, someone else behind the counter noticed me and took my order but overall It was a bizarre experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~1~May 8, 2024~When you pay in cash, Have you ever paid the coins over the amount so that the change coming back is paper cash? Whelp, don't expect this location to get that. My bill was $9.45 and I miss heard them and gave them $10.35 so I could get the $1 back and not all the coins. Without asking if I meant to pay 10cents short,  he just gave me the change. When I asked about it he shrugged and said some people want it that way. Seriously though, in what world would someone do this?? It Makes zero sense to give me back the coins I just gave you. I know for sure that I'm not going to drop in the tip jar like he assumed. Thanks guys glad to have stopped by and get more change for my wallet. I don't understand why cash handling is so hard to comprehend these days. It seems people have gotten lazy in their calculations due to the ease of credit use. It's a shame. PS. I specifically asked for an extra butter for the bagel and only got 1 but know I was charged. Again Thanks guys for just missing the mark. This location consistently misses add-ons or info for the orders
Phoenix, AZ 85054~2~Mar 6, 2022~I usually give Starbucks 4 to 5 stars and go to a lot of their locations. The problem with this one is they have shut down the indoor seating area for months(which has very nice furnishings). To make things worse, they would not even let me sit outside on one of their chairs(a first time for me at S Bucks)and there is no real patio.Apparently, the drive thru is active but a lot of people walk and bicycle.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~1~Mar 25, 2022~Drive thru has been closed for months. Drive thru line is extremely long and slow. They have someone sitting at a table blocking the door way taking `"mobile orders`". What a joke. Pick the Starbucks .4 miles to the south on Scottsdale road and Chauncey. Their lobby is open. Place is a joke.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~1~Sep 30, 2022~This is the third time I've gotten a drink from here that they half ass fill it up! If I'm paying $6-$7 for a drink all I ask is that it's fill up all the way!!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Dec 25, 2023~Anna M is the best barista I have ever had, she is so kind and caring and has the best personality. I love going to a Starbucks that has such caring people. I will be back for sure to leave a great tip for the staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~1~Nov 2, 2023~This Starbucks is by far the worst. The drive thru line was extremely long so I decided to go inside and order. 2 people in front of me, no big deal. But the 2 baristas are prioritizing the drive thru line so what should take 5 mins is turning into 20. So ridiculous!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~4~Jul 15, 2022~This is one of the nicest Starbucks I have ever been to! It is spacious, the staff is super friendly, albeit a little slow at making drinks but for the most part it is one of my favorite locations! There's plenty of seating, even some super comfortable chairs and the store is very spacious, and is great for relaxing, catching up with a friend, or working ! ! I also tried the bacon and Parmesan egg bites for the first time this morning and they were scrumptious! Overall I love coming here because  the drinks are consistency great and the staff  is always so welcoming and friendly!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Aug 17, 2023~Seth is the best Barista I've ever had, he needs a raise!! He always greets me with a smile and has the most positive attitude no matter what time it is!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Aug 18, 2021~A great roomy and big inside and out Starbucks. Delaney,barista and staff are wonderful.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Mar 20, 2023~Very friendly staff and excellent seating. Like the Starbucks of old which is a complement!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Dec 10, 2021~Malia is a 5 star employee! Grabbed some food and drinks at the drive-thru today and had the best interaction with Malia. She is personable, friendly, quick, and has the most pleasant voice! I hope to see her trained into a leadership position, she's a keeper.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~3~Apr 25, 2022~I placed a mobile order but I am now sitting in a long line of cars for the drive thru as the dining room is unexpectedly closed so I cannot go in to get my order. My ask is we get a heads up re drive thru only when we place a mobil order.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Jul 14, 2022~This Starbucks location is where the old Wendy's was at the Mayo 7000 shopping center is!  Absolutely gorgeous inside and a great staff!! Friendly baristas great seating inside and an efficient drive thru!!! Love this new location for Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~1~Mar 6, 2021~This might be the slowest Starbucks I've ever been to. It also doesn't help that those who work here appear to hate their jobs. When you pick up a mobile order inside because the line is too long...no one greets you and you end up standing there for 5 minutes waiting on someone to walk over and pay attention.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Oct 30, 2021~Times are tough and being short on staff, etc gives everyone a little slack. They can be slow and not as forthcoming with customer service but they get work done either way. I go every week. My only advice would be for the manager to be more friendly because you get a lot of repeat customers who appreciate the extra personalization and kindness.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~3~Aug 2, 2022~Neat and clean large location, modern and remodeled as well. The beverages also are pretty consistently made. Restroom could have been a tad cleaner.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~1~Apr 28, 2022~This location is terrible.  Mobile orders are turned on yet you have to go through the drive through to pick them up... so your drink is left to get cold or for the ice to melt.  The inside is still not open.  So basically as lazy as it gets.  Good job Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~1~Apr 9, 2022~Inside is never open, and they state it's a safety hazard to walk through the drive through.. 6 people working inside and couldn't take my order.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Jan 6, 2022~Kristen was amazing and went above and beyond to take care of us especially in these uncertain times. I will definitely come back to this location because of Kristen over any other Starbucks in the area.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~2~Dec 26, 2016~Two stars pretty much describes it. `"Meh. I've experienced better`" as the blurb in Yelp states for the two star rating. It sucks when you go to a Starbucks that lacks AC outlets... I really miss the ones in Southern California where they build in several power strips to maximize the availability of ports that you can plug your laptop into.This Starbucks has a power strip across a table so that if you plug into it, you've now created a tripping hazard for customers trying to get to the restrooms. Then the other power strip is by some sofas, not useful for customers that are trying to do work on their laptops, requiring a table where they can not only put their laptop on the table, but also their mouse to leverage smart-user capabilities.So, I couldn't even stay here for more than an hour since the applications I was using, plus the laptop cooler I was using was quickly draining my laptop battery.Plus, think about it. This Starbucks, while technically in Phoenix, is literally walking distance from Scottsdale, where people tend to have corporate jobs. Why in the hell would you not leverage your existing facility infrastructure to entice corporate type of customers to come in to spend money on drinks and hang out to do their work in an otherwise cozy environment?
Phoenix, AZ 85054~4~May 3, 2017~Love this place as a pit stop on my walks with our corgi!! Ice cubes for her &amp; caffeine for me=winning all around!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~2~Nov 21, 2014~I hate to write this review.... But I must have come at the WRONG time of day...Today's date 11/21/14 @ 6:36pm.To start, I came i, and when I went to the counter to order, the guy with a beard seemed unhappy that I came in.I asked if they still had peach flavoring,The girl with glasses and a pony tail immediately tells me `"no we don't. That's only a summer thing and we can't order it.`" the way she said this made me feel stupid for even asking...I replied `"I know some stores still have it, that is why I just wanted to ask.`"Then after I ordered a berry refresher, the same girl and guy were asking each other to make it-in a way that made it seem like neither of them wanted to do it.When the girl said my drink and put it at the bar, I approached and thanked them and her response was, `"yep.`" as she walked into the back sipping her drink(what looked to be a tea).Not only did I feel stupid for ASKING if they peach flavoring, but I did not feel valued as a customer.. I honestly wanted to walk out after my first question...I hate to write this review because there are some people that are always SOOO nice when I go in. It has made me want to actually work at this location (I worked at a different location [FWL/101] which I ended up leaving because of a terrible work experience- another story...) but after seeing these two employees, I really don't want to even bother thinking about that anymore.The two employees who have been nothing but AMAZING are Sebrina, and a taller lady with short bleached blonde hair.- usually work morning/midday. They really take customer service to an amazing height and really do make you feel valued.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~4~Mar 9, 2015~This is my go-to starbucks. The people who work here are really friendly. The outdoor seating along Mayo boulevard is strangely peaceful if you want a little respite from your day.  It's generally not over-crowded which is a nice change from some of the starbucks on or near Frank Lloyd wright blvd.  My only complaint is the outlet situation. If you're coming here to do work on a computer there sometimes aren't enough outlets, and some of the outlets are near comfy chairs instead of near tables.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Mar 5, 2015~I'm giving this Starbucks location only 5 stars, since Yelp doesn't allow the 10 stars.Starbucks is Starbucks, the difference is made by the baristas. And this location has THE BEST, energetic, fast, friendly and positive baristas behind the counter, any time of any day I've been there. Everyone, including myself, is greeted with a positive smile, every barista know everone's name &amp; drink. The best part of my morning used to be a killer workout at OrangeTheory Fitness. Now, its to be at this Starbucks after my workout.The facility is always clean, lines move quick and I feel the positive baristas love what they are doing!  Britni, Catelyn and others are all an exemplary Starbucks baristas.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~4~Jun 4, 2013~This Sarbucks is right next to my work so I am here 3-4 times a week (at least!) One thing I really like is their large patio equipped with a misting system.  The majority of the tables are under the roof awning so it's a great place to relax with your coffee and utilize their free WiFi or go old school and read the paper. If your lucky you might even see one of their regulars; a gentleman who sits outside with his toucan on his shoulder! Scared the bejesus out of me first time I walked past him...Inside the baristas are friendly and efficient and have no problem making custom offers. They also regularly have samples of new drinks and/or food items out for customers to sample. There is also adequate seating inside if you can't deal with the heat!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Nov 7, 2014~This Starbucks is great! This place is my first stop before my day of responsibilities begins.  The morning crew is the best.  Sunny and shining bright  Sabrina is my favorite young barista. The newer manager Brittany is so sweet and helpful too.  How can somebody be so happy when people just take their coffee issues so seriously?!  The rest of the baristas have managed to get my complicated orders right most of the time.  The one time they didn't, it was immediately fixed.  No biggie, my day progressed.  The ambiance is clean.  This is a cafe style Starbucks with plenty of seating outside for coffee enjoyment and perfect weather during the fall/winter months.   It's a little tuckedaway in a plaza near Harkins and across the street from Wholefoods.  The service is quick and friendly, my coffee is hot and my drink is always yummy.  I feel for the people who work in these types of environments, it certainly doesn't look easy.  Maybe the yelpers reviewing these places need to work at a Starbucks for a week or two.  I don't know how I would handle a bunch of tired and grumpy people demanding perfection. Thank you for waking up at 4 am to serve me coffee guys!  You betcha buns I'm gonna tip!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~2~Mar 17, 2013~Just like the rating. Meh.Baristas look like they are bored out of their minds.My friend wanted to inquire about their free Tall Hazelnut macchiato, and boy were they sour about it. They decide to honor the promotion, like they should, and gave my friend her free drink. I bought a venti sized, and was given what? Caramel macchiato.Disappointed for sure, and I won't be coming back, mainly cuz I live in Southern California.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Jul 14, 2015~These people are so friendly. I have a Starbucks in my resort and the people are amazing there too. I chose to come to this location out of my way because of the service &amp; great smiles in the early morning.  Thanks guys!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Mar 18, 2012~I love Starbucks coffee.  My new favorite is the blonde roast.  This location gets pretty crowded, especially on Friday mornings.  The baristas here are really friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~3~Oct 13, 2014~The day time staff are awesome here, a couple of the night time baristas need an attitude check. The man with the beard (who I am pretty sure is a manager) is Always ridiculously rude. As well as the old lady. A smile goes a long way guys.And God forbid you make a special request for your drink, it's such a hassle. Is that what starbucks is?Coffee and tea drinks custom made to fit each and every customers needs or wants?
Phoenix, AZ 85054~2~Aug 7, 2014~When I see the word Starbucks I immediately go to a happy place and I'm stoked to get coffee from that moment forward and its soooo disappointing coming to this location with the staff being so darn rude. At first I thought `"maybe I just hold Starbucks to a higher standard in customer service`" but after reading the other reviews now I know it's not just me. They really do mess up orders here on a regular basis. 1. I've been over charged on two different occasions and then glared at when I asked for them to fix it. 2. Eye contact.... Its a thing. (Lisa should learn it)3. Don't ask me what I want with your back turned to me.4. If you don't want to ask for my name then you should make sure your saying loud and clear what's going on the counter. I unfortunately will continue to come here because I worked down the street but each and every time I'll be over cautious of what's being charged and dissatisfied with the service.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~4~Jan 22, 2012~I have NO idea why I said this Starbucks was on the smaller side. It's huge compared to some of the others I've been in.Either way, the employees are very outgoing and understanding (my partner never knows what to order). The service is quick and efficient.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~4~Aug 1, 2010~Typical Starbucks, on the smaller side. Great Latte that hit the spot.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~4~Feb 16, 2015~Love it here! Very nice people and service is quick! Perfect for mornings when I'm cutting it close to get to work.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Dec 17, 2015~Love this starbucks location! Wish I could take all the baristas to the starbucks by me cause these girls ROCK! Great customer service from everyone and always getting my drink right
Phoenix, AZ 85054~3~Mar 27, 2011~Smaller than normal Starbucks, but plenty of parking.  Nice location in nice shopping area.  Staff was polite.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Jan 12, 2014~This is my - on the way to work - Starbucks and I must say, the staff are always polite, efficient and friendly. My very early mornings at work are always made much more pleasant. I've been to roughly 1 million of the 10 million Starbucks in this nation, and customer service is apparently optional. This store is the exception. Take the extra trip to come here. ( just please do so after 8am so there's no line ) :)
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Jan 2, 2015~I come in here pretty frequently and have never had an issue. Everyone is extremely friendly and they are FAST. Even when it's super busy, I never find myself having to wait more than a couple minutes in line. Although there isn't much indoor seating, there are quite a few seats outside. The store just has an overall good energy. The baristas seem to be happy with their job and that really reflects :) Keep on keeping on !
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Dec 9, 2014~Staff here is awesome, all smiles and great customer service. They do their best to learn your name and regardless of what kind of day they're having, they manage to make you laugh. I favor this specific location as it is close to my job and the atmosphere and clientele lend themselves to business meetings and productivity.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Apr 10, 2012~I love stopping by this Starbucks. The staff here is great and it seems to be a lower traffic location- which makes for a quick drink or quiet break.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Oct 13, 2012~Never a bad experience at Starbucks.  I am here with my dog, Molly.  Being respectful of the premises I did not bring Molly into the store. I called the store and spoke to Terry who took my order and brought it out to me. She even brought Molly a cup of water...a nice touch!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Jun 20, 2015~This is by far THE BEST Starbucks. I get my morning coffee there and no other location compares. The manager Brittany is great! She cares about her guests and teaches the employees the same. Each drink I get there is always made with care and is correct! The morning staff knows me by name and is always friendly. And with the new mobile order and pay, I get to skip the morning rush! Love this place!!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~1~Jul 7, 2014~Don't get coffee here. One staff person isn't clean.    There's a grungy looking bearded guy with Mohawk that works on weekends, saw adjust his underwear from the crack of his a$$ and did not wash his hands. He reached in far, ish was nasty yo. . Also, slow wifi and no outlets.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~4~Dec 2, 2011~Quaint little spot, gets pretty crowded during busy hours, but experienced baristas that handle it with ease. Other than that, just your average Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Jan 29, 2015~Staff is great. They know my order before I put one in. Other locations aren't as quick and organized.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Jun 18, 2011~When I try to kick my caffeine habit Starbucks is there to make sure I can't. When I want to just sleep the day away without getting hyped up on coffee, Starbucks is there to make sure I can't. Thanks Starbucks. I hate you.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Feb 24, 2011~First, the girls here are mostly really cute. Especially the blonde. And they are extremely friendly. The manager is really cool too. I'm a fan.
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Jan 18, 2016~Love love love this Starbucks!!! The barista's know there shit and always make my coffee perfect! I make it a point to go to this location versus others because they are so much better
Phoenix, AZ 85054~5~Apr 6, 2015~Awesome service, friendly staff who knew my regular order within a few days. They always get it right too! Love this location.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~~I really like this location at Kierland Commons. I usually get the Matcha Frappuccino but decided to get out of my comfort zone and ordered the mocha cookie crumble Frappuccino knowing I was going to regret it as it's pretty calorific. But nope, I thoroughly enjoyed it as it was so delish and satisfying. This location seems like a great place to hang out and even work from home. There's plenty of comfortable chairs (they were all occupied and everyone seemed very relaxed) and tables.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~~Stopped in for drinks. Today was a Father's Day BOGO.  I got my usual of an Expresso Frappuccino.The store is spacious, and enough tables and chairs for people to sit, relax, and enjoy their drinks/food. The service was super friendly and nice!My wife ordered a mocha Latte (hot)...in Scottsdale in the scorching heat of 106 degrees! The barista laughed but said, `"her sister does the same thing.`"
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~~Lovely location to just pop in for a coffee after or in between shopping in Kirkland Commons. Lots of inside and outside seating. Service was fast as I used the app to order ahead.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Aug 5, 2024~Worst customer service by `"acting`" manager Benjamin. I am disappointed in his inability to use discretion with the `"rules`" of the store regarding `"sleeping`". My husband closed his eyes while sitting next to me while I ate and drank food/beverages purchased at the store.... Benjamin proceeded to get my husbands attention and scolded him for sleeping. I am well aware the rule is in regards to transient occupying the lobby and seeping, as this is a problem in our city. That was not this. A well dressed, paying customer sitting upright at a table next to his wife who was on her computer (not lying on the table, or on the ground, or in a random chair of the store), simply closing his eyes and dozing off.  I am also well aware of policy, and how it may apply to specific settings. There's also something called discretion and exceptions to policy. It may have been a good time to use such an idea.Ben may want to spend more time on valuable customer service and environmental conditions like replacing the empty toilet paper discovered in his bathroom. I have been a customer at this store since it opened and have never received such poor service.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jun 16, 2024~Great service at this location everyday. Probably out favorite Starbucks location. It's a little hard to get into the drive through but other than that great.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Dec 8, 2023~This is one of the comfier, roomier Starbucks with nice couch seating, lounge chairs and work tables.Barista service is excellent-professional, courteous and communicate well. The only negative is they close at 6pm....9 or 10pm would be better since it's located in a popular shopping center.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jan 30, 2024~Ordered via mobile order,  picked it up.  Drove several miles and started to drink my coffee only to realize the batista made a totally different drink and put it on my cup labeled with the correct drink.  The drink that was not correct was actually pretty nasty and heavily tasted of cinnamon. The drink I ordered does not have cinnamon.  Called the store and they would not credit the wrong drink back.  Said I had to drive all the way back to that store.  Not cool.  $$ litterly poured down the drain.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jun 23, 2024~Nothing improves at this Starbucks unfortunately. Baristas are not trained to make coffee at all. Oat milk latte tasted like water and there was no coffee taste at all. Not sure what is going in.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Feb 5, 2022~Really mismanaged location. On a Saturday morning, tables were not cleaned and customers had left a mess everywhere. Cafe was stinking and could not have a coffee here. Restrooms were also filthy and not sure what is going on here?
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jan 25, 2024~Baristas have no clue how to make coffee drinks here. A very disappointing and bitter macchiato ever had in the history of going to Starbucks. Looks like lack of training and no inclination to learn either.Location closes at 3pm which is very strange. Great area but not so good Starbucks. Associates aren't friendly at all.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Apr 4, 2024~They ran out of dark roast and wanted to blend my coffee with Pike. (this happens regularly at the store) I wanted to get to work and left with my less than satisfactory coffee. When I got to the office I picked up the coffee and the lid was not securely fastened. It spilt  it all over my crotch, drivers seat and center console. I fried two remotes- one that can't be replaced because the opener is 25 years old. The coffee didn't scald me but was hot enough to burn. I called the store to complain and the `"manager`" made me re-tell my story to the real manager and all I got out of her was `"Sorry about that`"! There are too many coffee competitors to put up with this BS. I plan to never go to another Starbucks. Incompetent.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Dec 19, 2023~How do you have three workers and only one person is making the drinks. Never have I waited 47 minutes for a grande iced matcha latte! Please let your customers know the wait time is 45 minutes long! I wouldn't have placed an order.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~~The perfect study spot or meet-up place with friends before/after a day of shopping! This Starbucks is located in Kierland, right in between P.F. Chang's and Snooze. I've been coming to this location since it first opened years ago. I've spent a lot of days here studying and applying for colleges/grad schools. The staff are always kind, the store itself is clean, and there's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. I came in today (Monday after Christmas), and it was really busy around 10am. I ordered a turkey bacon and egg sandwich and an iced cappuccino. The sandwich came out quickly, but my drink took at least 10-15 minutes. It got to the point where I had to awkwardly ask the barista if they had forgotten about my drink. However, I understand the staff were really busy and overwhelmed, especially since it's the holidays. My sandwich and drink both came out perfectly and how I like them. I will still come back here!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~~This location is one hot mess! I'm visiting from Charlotte and needed some much needed energy! I took my sister with me so we could get something together and walk around the area. She lives right down the street and comes here all the time. When we came in, the line was out the door. This place was packed. No one knew where to stand. The door was being blocked. It was very loud. Lots of things going on all at once. This is a very small location. All the Starbucks in Charlotte are at least double the size. We both ordered a large mocha cookie crumble. The lady taking our order was super friendly. Once we ordered, we had to stand again in another mosh of people. Small corner to stand and wait for your drinks. Our drinks took about 25 minutes to make which is just insane. Thank goodness the ones in Charlotte aren't this bad. But again location, location, location.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~~This Starbucks is conveniently close and it's nice to pop into when shopping in Kierland Commons.  It's a smaller Starbucks which I prefer to the larger drive through ones.   I had the new Dragon Fruit drink and it was surprisingly good.  Not too sweet which I thought it would be and I really liked this non caffeinated drink option.  Please keep offering more variety like this at options to the coffee drinks which I don't drink.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Dec 27, 2021~I mean customer service was okay but I order a tall Carmel macchiato with almond milk and it came up to 6.03 which I thought was kind of ridiculous but then on top of that it didn't taste good! I've have this same exact drink with almond milk but the others didn't taste like this one. Overall dissatisfied.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jul 23, 2019~Nicole, Rafael and Andrew are superstars.  Nicole snd Rafael handled a rude customer like true pros, and Andrew is a super star on the register! Thanks everyone!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 26, 2019~Yo had the pumpkin latte it was awesome hot with whip cream .it's a must have go today are tonight on a date she will love it .and don't forget the whip cream hot . Kid from Brooklyn and I approve this message
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Dec 2, 2021~Nice place to come and have a light meal and coffee. They have a large room with lot of sitting places. Service is fast . Restroom needs more frequent service due to heavy no of guests. Price is above average. Lot of varieties to choose from. Get app for it. Come , relax and enjoy.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Sep 30, 2022~This Starbucks is almost never open. I walked over today from my workplace, and at 3pm they were closed, but a bunch of employees were sitting around inside doing paperwork. Too busy doing paperwork to make drinks??Such a strange vibe.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Sep 1, 2022~Just came home from a visit to this Starbucks on Christmas Eve! Thank you to the girls for working so hard and being incredibly kind to me (and working on this holiday!) Stopped by after some late holiday shopping and thought I should pick up some drinks for family at home. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and the young girl up front was super nice and patient with me as I had some app complications, and gave me great drink recommendations as well! I was handed my 4 drinks with a smile by another gal and left with a farewell. I usually go to Starbucks drive thrus and I'm in and out without so much as a `"welcome in `" or `"have a nice day`" so this was such a nice change of pace :)
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Mar 19, 2019~This used to be quite a nice place. Not anymore. The facilities are aging poorly. Broken blinds, dirty floors and garbage regularly overflowing from the bins.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~~This Starbucks is amazing! Big shout out to Rafael. I noticed his smile from the back of the line. He interacts with everyone with a big smile and warm heart. He made my first experience at this location perfect!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~~So, at this point we've all formed an opinion of what we think of Starbucks coffee?  Either it floats your boat or doesn't.Coming from the Pacific Northwest, I was use to a wide selection of different coffee places, Tully's and Peet's (where it all began) for example; or any of the number of small coffee shacks that seem to be on every corner in greater Seattle.  But here in the Valley, unless you're willing to track down a Fry's Marketplace to find a Tully's, you'll need to settle for Starbucks.Now that I've gotten that out out of the way, I have a love hate relationship with this Starbucks location.  I come here several times each day, or to the Press Coffee across Scottsdale Road.  The Baristas are great, very friendly and rarely if ever get my order wrong.  What is frustrating is what I call the Internet moochers.  Because of Starbuck's free WiFi policy, there is never a place to sit inside and enjoy your drink and read the paper.  Or, God forbid, getting up and ordering a refill.  People will pounce on that seat!It was different before they changed the policy and made WiFi free.  Don't get me wrong, some days it's actually pretty good.  But for the most part it's a bear getting a seat and what is the capacity here?  50, maybe 75?  That's a lot of customers drinking Mr. Schultz's version of Peet's coffee!  So I would guess this is one of the largest, certainly most profitable stores in the greater Phoenix area.  Why change the business model if it isn't broken, right?Well in the beginning, when Mr. Schultz took over the marketing at Peet's, he wanted to recreate that coffee house feeling that he found in Paris.  The feeling I have here is of a college library on caffeine.  A lot of laptops open, but not a lot of coffee being drank.So, if you're on the run and just want to grab a Cup of Joe, then this is your best bet in the Kierland area.  But, if you want to order your brew, sit down and read the paper, or just enjoy a conversation with your neighbor -- try Press Coffee across Scottsdale Road and the real life version of Frogger getting there.  Now, that will get your heart racing!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~~I like the location but I can never find work space. Need more umbrellas and bigger tables to accommodate other users. It would for sure increase their business.It is located in a great spot for after lunch or dinner shopping and PT. Surrounded by great restaurants both here and across the street.It is just an overly busy spot. Too busy for me most times...
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Mar 29, 2022~This Starbucks isn't bad, it's just always insanely busy. That being said, I'm still here! For those of us in North Scottsdale who work from home, this is definitely a convenient spot. Seating can be hard to come by, especially before 10 am, so plan accordingly. Make sure you keep an eye out for your drink and who was in front of you because sometimes people walk off with drinks that aren't theirs and you end up waiting forever.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jan 25, 2012~this is the third time in a row my mobile order has not been ready after ordering it 15 min prior to arriving AND my drink has been made horribly wrong. I've thrown away three drinks now because they've been making my drink with too much espresso. it's so bitter I can't even drink it. such a waste of money and a bad start to my day.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Sep 14, 2017~Stopped in for a coffee while waiting for our table next door at Snooze. Quite a few tables and chairs to sit outside and pretty spacious inside. Just like every location I have been no real interaction. Customer service is ok, but it was quick and painless today. Dutch Bros just can't be beat. I'll stick to the usual.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jan 9, 2015~Took 40 minutes for a drink and another 5 to get a straw that I found out late that it was too short. Common of this location (really all of them anymore.).
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 12, 2022~Solid location next door to some much busier breakfast places. Sometimes ya gotta go with tried and true as opposed to waiting forever.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Apr 22, 2018~Stopped by to get a Grande Pink Drink. Store has plenty of seating and clean. Staff was quick and friendly and my pink drink was tasty.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Mar 4, 2022~5/5 for the Starbucks at kierland. Plenty of seating options inside and out. Great spot for people watching. Finding seats are difficult during the busy season but coming to this location is worth It. Plus, it is pumpkin spice season
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~~Always great, but crowded. Restrooms can be a hit and miss on cleanliness since there's just so many people around. The crew is efficient and very thoughtful. Just don't come here for an important meet and greet since you won't be comfortable.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~~I really like this Starbucks. The service is always quick and friendly and their is plenty of exterior seating, including outdoor sofas as well as traditional metal tables.The problem is that while the interior is spacious and very well appointed, it's really difficult to get a seat inside. I suppose we can't fault them for their popularity though!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~~Wow, this place always has a line. Been here several times; they make their drinks fast. Great and convenient location.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Nov 14, 2018~Great place to come and work while enjoying coffee/breakfast. I come in frequently and each time I always find a table either inside or out. Tons of shaded seating outside as well. Parking on all sides of the building.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Oct 24, 2015~Stopped by here before grabbing brunch at Snooze next door. The spot is a typical Starbucks. The baristas were very friendly (especially the lady letting me pick which butterfly cookie color I wanted which I thought was nice). The place is clean and although, it was quite crowded I was able to find a seat with my two friends. I had a juice and it was solid like normal. Nothing fancy here, but solid Starbucks.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jun 9, 2016~slowest starbucks ever. can't hear when drinks are called.No name on the cup. No order tag on the cup. Waited for 15 min and they had to open the drink to know what it was. Coffee should be fast! I must need to learn patience today.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~May 21, 2019~Nice people, although they don't make a cold brew cascara foam coffee very well.  Get a better version at the frys Starbucks down the road.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Mar 27, 2017~All Starbucks restaurants are filthy...This one is exceptionally so...How does this attitude transfer to the employees and is so disrespectful to their patrons...We much prefer to go to Press across the street but not open yet.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 27, 2017~I have been to Starbucks all over this wonderful continent of ours....and this may be one of the best of them all. So let me set the scene for you because for you TRUE Starbucks fans you will understand what I am saying. Picture yourself walking into Starbucks.....the smell of the coffee drinks being made....dimly lit room.....tables and chairs for all of those who want have there latte's,....tea....coffee....iced coffee...mocha's.....pastries......ipads.....laptops....cellphones....etc....Then BLAM THOSE HUGE LINES....PEOPLE WALKING BETWEEN YOU AND OVER YOU BECAUSE THE COUNTER IS RIGHT NEARBY AND YOUR LIKE ARRRRRRRHHHHH. However those days are a thing of the past at this location.There is plenty of outdoor seating.....nice dimly lit room as usual.....tons and I mean tons of space and outlets for that matter for you to get digitally plugged in no matter what kind of device you have.....and then BLAM.....ooooohhhh wait I got ya there...LOL.There is no BLAM because the `"digital`" space you have to work with is at least 20 feet from the counter.....and while it does get busy here....you won't really notice a crowd unless your absolutely paying attention to the crowd only. The service is awesome....the coffee drinks are awesome as always.....and trust me they really do keep the line moving. I was really impressed with the size of this location....I have not seen one bigger....I was also impressed with all of the `"digital`" space and outdoor seating......have not seen more anywhere........I was also impressed with the service....I was also impressed.....WAIT.....I think you get my drift.....I WAS IMPRESSED PERIOD.This Starbucks has shot up to #1 on my list of Starbucks locations....if you know one better anywhere in the country...with the exception of the one at Starbucks Headquarters....LOL....please let me know.....and as always continue to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Sep 25, 2019~It's amazing. They follow COVID procedures so you have to wear a mask, but the whole Kierland complex requires it so it's no big deal. The service is outstanding, despite it always being busy. I come here quite often and there's one employee who always seems to remember my drink. I think her name is Natalie, she's very sweet. There are a ton of people who come in from the mall. So having someone who can always remember my drink just makes my day even better. Will be coming here for a long time.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~3 Photos ~The service here is always great, fast and friendly. The only reason I'm really writing this review is to let the location know that the Rip van Wafels that are up front had expired not too long ago. I purchased one today and noticed that the one I got expired on October 2nd
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~1 Photo ~It was a rainy day today, and I was meeting two friends to study at Starbucks at Kierland.  A great location with plenty of seating, apparently everyone had the same idea as me.  When I walked in, all inside seating was taken and there were long lines to order drinks and also for the restroom.  Recognizing this was due to the weather and that Starbucks couldn't do anything differently about this, I was quite impressed with how quickly the lines moved and how friendly the staff were.  Ordering a tall hot chocolate, I enjoyed a nice hot beverage while only waiting a short while to find seats for my friends and me to study.  With so many people there, the Internet was quite slow for a while until many of the customers left (when the weather got better).  More seating appeared, the lines subsided, and the Internet got faster.  All in all, it was a very productive few hours for my friends and me as we also got several beverages and enjoyed the atmosphere.  I'll definitely be going back!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~2 Photos ~This is place is always packed!  It draws people with laptops in.  You order and have barely enough place for you to stand to wait for your drink.  The other patrons are mostly pretty rude.  The grab whatever drink they think it is theirs.  The staff has been very friendly.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Oct 8, 2016~I was very disappointed of the guy who worked behide cash register . He made mistake on my expresso freppuccino  and he would not replace my drink he was rude and wanted to charge me again for a replacement drink .
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Jan 27, 2013~Slowest Starbucks! Insane. 2 people ahead of me and the amount of time I waited was insane. I decided to see how long it made to take being people were standing around waiting and no drinks going out.....12 minutes. One coffe and over 20 minutes.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Nov 15, 2015~Trents iced coffee with half and half is my go to! Customer service is always great and love the atmosphere !
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Mar 17, 2019~Love coming to this location. It's always busy but it's part of the experience, yall! There is a nice Asian barista that is always very patient and sweet and her smile is infectious.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Jun 14, 2020~Very friendly person who made my frappucino- chatted with me while he made it. Tasted great with added shot of mocha. Otherwise it doesn't taste mocha-y enough. There were lots of people enjoying beverages but line was short and made the beverages very quickly and efficiently.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Nov 25, 2018~While some of the staff are somewhat friendly, the other half of the staff here are rude, short with you and dismissive. I've been here probably 25-30 times and it's odd that it's such a mixed bag. I've been here on several occasions where the employees are more concerned with pre-closing and getting chores done so they can leave. I've pretty much never had a drink made correctly here and shots are killed / dead 85% of the time.I love Starbucks, and if it weren't for this stores great location I wouldn't ever come back. My thoughts go to the few employees at this location that do try hard, my guess is poor management.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Jun 11, 2016~I travel full time for work, and am at different Starbucks multiple  times per week in different cities/states.   I'm embarrassed to say this is the Starbucks near my home...all three workers were rude and treated my husband and I like it was an inconvenience that we were ordering coffee (I could maybe let it slide if it was busy, but there was not line).  The only reason I didn't give them  1 star is because  the drinks were good (as usual, but would be expected).  At least I know I won't be going here again, as there are much better places to meet up with people (and other Starbucks not far away if that's what we're in the mood for).  Disappointing.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~~Not sure what or when this location went from great to spotty... What's sad is this location has so much going for it but it severely lacks in customer service.  There is one barista that is decent and seems to recognize the regulars but otherwise no one seems to care.  The store used to have a lot of great displays and items like tumblers etc but now it seems it's an afterthought.  Hopefully you can get back to the basics and bring the location back to what it was soon
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~~Better baristas, great location and mobile ordered. Perfect. For some reason Monday's are not as busy as other mornings at this location. The couches outside are great and comfortable for just sitting and enjoying your beverage and pastry. This location also has a nice selection of Starbucks items.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~~If you use the mobile ordering...beware. Depending on who is working you might have to wait 10 minutes for your order. Went a couple of days apart and different times of the day... Other times mobile ordering is on point. Just depends on the quality of the barista I guess. Other Starbucks do not seem to have this issue...just pls be more aware of the mobile customers. UPDATED: Much better on the mobile ordering...looks like the current baristas are on point.  Have mobile ordered several times since my review and am confident enough to state it's been fixed. Thank you! Still one of the BEST Starbucks. Are they busy...absolutely. But the barista's do the best they can to serve drinks and food with a smile and in a timely manner.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Oct 4, 2020~UPDATED: Much better on the mobile ordering...looks like the current baristas are on point.  Have mobile ordered several times since my review and am confident enough to state it's been fixed. Thank you!

Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Jul 26, 2016~This is one of my favorite Starbucks on my jaunts through Scottsdale. Always busy and pretty efficient this Starbucks  is perfect for that quick snack or Frapp.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Oct 26, 2015~I don't live in Scottsdale. I don't have much in common with people that live in Scottsdale (no money, no little dog with blinged out collar, and no BMW) but I do enjoy the ample seating and courteous staff of this Starbucks location. There are an abundant number of comfy seats (10 I think), regular seating (at least 20 seats) and a huge outside seating area (with at least 10 tables), more than any other Starbucks I've been too. It's usually pretty busy during the day, but in the evening it's the perfect place to study or meet a few friends. Although I usually just get an iced tea or water, the times I've ordered other drinks they were well-made and to my specifications. On the one occasion they forgot to make my drink, they promptly gave me a free drink coupon and apologized profusely. All that being said, it's still a Starbucks and if you're afraid of the big bad corporation, feel free to steer clear. ;) Being in a part of town where there aren't any indy coffee shops, I have little choice. But, if you're feeling brave, and in the mood to have a cup of joe in a nice location, Starbucks at Kierland is a good choice!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Sep 19, 2015~The only reason to drink coffee is if I'm all stopped-up from my wife's pot roast. Otherwise I steer clear of coffee and caffeine related products.Fortuitously however, I discovered another reason to like coffee, and did so at Starbucks yesterday.Their trenta sized cup.It was a great Sunday dinner...pot roast as usual but now it was Monday morning and time to 'pay the piper'. I stopped at Starbucks on the way to work.As bad luck sometimes has it, traffic was running slow that day...much slower than usual. I suspected something was wrong. It was...the overhead freeway sign indicating a severe crash on the 51.Great.I just drank thirty ounces of coffee and was now in the throes of a face-grimacing, bladder-busting event.This is where the thirty ounce cup came in handy. Once filled with warm, steaming coffee, it was now filled with something equally warm and steaming.Whether you like coffee or not, you'll enjoy the wide rimmed opening and the large capacity of the trenta sized cup. It's able to contain even the most hearty of uncontrollable pissing events. Way to go Starbucks trenta!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Jun 21, 2015~Jeremy made our day when we were visiting from Seattle.  Beautiful location and watching Jeremy behind the coffee bar proved that there are still Starbucks Baristas that handle their job professionally and who would make Howard Schultz very proud!  It was a busy time and Jeremy worked smoothly, efficiently and stayed composed the entire time.   Drinks were perfect.  KUDOS to the Manager for hiring this young man.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Oct 21, 2008~Yes, I am a SBUX fan.... I frequent many. But this one is always, always so busy! It can be super difficult to score a table here.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Mar 20, 2012~A large and always-busy location, the Starbucks at Kierland has a reputation as the `"pickup`" Starbucks, as in, it's a great place to meet and perhaps find a spark with fellow coffee lovers. The pre-work line can get long, but behind the counter they move fast. I've set up shop a few times to work and haven't had trouble finding a spot, usually against the wall for some good people watching (no Prince Charmings though)!  The last dirty chai latte I had from this location was overly milky, so that's clouding my mind right now! If you are a foufy drink aficionado, check it out, but if you're a purist, save some money and head around the corner to Chloe's for 50 cent hot or iced coffees and fantastically unique muffins and scones.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Nov 16, 2017~I love Starbucks! Even worked at one for awhile! But THIS is the worst one I've ever seen! Parking is awful! Snobby atmosphere... really?? It's just a Starbucks. It's always dirty &amp; there's never available seating! Each Starbucks takes on its own personality and community feel... this one is a riot! If you love to people watch you might get a charge out of this place... it's a circus!! It's not any fault of the Starbucks corporation!  Seriously, it reminds me of going out for breakfast in Moscow... it's a scream!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 25, 2011~This is my favorite Starbucks. I literally can sit here for hours upon hours and get so much work done. The staff is amazing, especially Justin Watkins. He has been there for such a long time and continues to be a faithful server to the customers! Thank you for making my experience here amazing.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Oct 23, 2012~Don't like it at all , I always get this coffee but when I got it at this location test was horrible and customer service was poor. Never back
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Aug 16, 2017~I am a regular Starbuckser in NY. I was visiting for the week and decided to order from this one since it was conveniently located near my hotel. I ordered the sous vide, which was thrown in the Starbucks food bag which I asked to be placed into a container of some sort only to find out that the peppers were hard when eating. My coffee was okay. As I tried to speak to the woman behind the counter she barely looked at me and didn't want to talk to me. Honestly, why work somewhere where you aren't happy or where you can't put a smile on your face and provide exceptional customer service. I'm sure there's someone else who needs a job. Although, the woman behind the register seemed pleasant.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~~Bigger than a typical Starbucks. There's lots of indoor and outdoor seating but it can get busy and fill up. Especially early mornings. Parking can be tight when the mall stores open up at 10 AM. Located in the upscale Kierland shopping center which is very cool. Scottsdale Quarter shopping center is right across the street.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~~If I had it in my heart to give a Starbucks a five-star review, this would be it. But in writing a review, I have to take into account the coffee product itself, and honestly, with our Jura machine at home, we get better coffee and espresso, and go figure --  we use Starbucks beans.  I'll chock it up to our grind and strength.Having prefaced it by the above, this is probably the best Starbucks location I've visited. Even with ten people ahead of me in line, it was less than five minutes before I had my cafe latte and spinach, egg white and feta wrap in hand! The place was packed with nary an available seat inside, so I grabbed one of  the comfy outdoor patio seats. It was a perfect morning to linger over my drink while I waited for a friend to finish up at the dentist. It's also great for people watching as just about everyone who works at Kierland Commons stops by for `"whatever`".As an aside, it was the first time I tried the spinach, egg white and feta wrap, based on the recommendations of two young girls in line behind me, and ooh, it is by far the best `"fast food`" breakfast I have ever had!  Kudos to Starbucks for steering me clear of the former beloved Egg McMuffin!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~~Staying cool with a yummy iced pumpkin latte. Of course it was a little crowded but nothing you wouldn't expect from a midday Starbucks run.The location is amazing. And even has misters for the outdoors.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Mar 18, 2015~Extremely slow service, no sense of urgency even with a line out the door. Seems like they have a lot of new people that don't know what they are doing. Super frustrating experience!! Also bathroom was a huge mess.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jun 13, 2012~One of my favorite starbucks to go to, they make the drinks perfect even when they are super busy, also has the nicest staff!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Oct 1, 2015~Place is OVERWHELMED by costumers and insufficient amount of staff .... Therefore Service is Mediocre !!! Only one very experience barista is making all the coffee... She is extremely fast but still insufficient.I don't need to be AGGRAVATED on Sunday morning waiting 10 minutes for SIMPLE espresso that a  `"monkey`" can press a button!The outdoors space is excellent. Management must make changes to address peaks in demands.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Jun 22, 2016~One staff this morning very `"officious`" bordering on rude thank goodness the barista was awesome
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Mar 9, 2019~Great service. I've been more than a few times over the years and everyone is pleasant. It's a popular location so finding a table can be tricky.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Feb 21, 2016~Definitely the best. Even despite the mass amount of people that are always in line this Starbucks is always fast AND friendly.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Nov 1, 2018~Ok, don't nut punch me 'cause I'm writing a review on Da Bux.  I'm not here to review the mediocre drip, the yeast infected pastries, nor the annoying indie music.  I'm here to say that this Starbucks has more eye candy for the 30 something crowd than a 75% off sale at Banana Republic.  It starts with being one of the largest Bux in all of Phoenix.  It is 3X bigger than any of the other green brown stations in the area.  This lends itself to bunches of coffee cake crusted comfy cushions and chairs that spill out into an L-shaped patio with a Parisian bistro flair.  Now for you ladies (hey, hey, ladies!), the pecs around here usually sport specs since they are in their 30's to 50's, but they got cash (or they are at least nicely dressed perverts).  NOW, for us guys, the breasts around here are more fake then the goods lining Shanghai's flea markets.  But heck, as long as those nipples aren't plastic, I'll bite.+++'s: THE best Starbucks for older eye-candy (30+), free Wi-fi with your starbucks card, ample seating, always a good clean crowd, in Kierland commons- - -'s: it's another StarbucksIn sum, if you want to enjoy a cup of Joe (or Jane) in style, this is the Starbucks to do it at.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~~One of my favorite Starbucks around. Always great service, reliable Wi-Fi, ample comfortable seating and pleasant atmosphere. I highly recommend this Starbucks.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~~Great quick service!  Try the Starbucks double shot on ice, it's super good.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~~Great service. Great experience. The place is always packed but they are super quick.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Feb 1, 2016~Bathrooms were wayyyyy worse than most gas station bathrooms. No regular maintenance or apparent responsibility by staff. Slow service. Not a happy environment from the top down.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Jul 4, 2016~This place is always packed!!! But it is a great place to work because they have the coolest `"desktops`" near the front entrance.There are also an abundance of the `"comfy`" living room style chairs. This is a `"big`" Starbuck compared to others in the area. There is almost always a line waiting to order. But they keep things moving. Aside from my above comments... its a Starbucks. You either love it or hate it.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Jun 30, 2016~As a Starbuck's Gold Card holder (aka I drink far too much Starbucks), I have become accustomed to certain attitudes and services from them. And this place didn't really hold up to those expectations. First off, this Starbuck's is located in a large outdoor mall so you know it is going to be busy. It was about 5pm on a Saturday and there were still a few hours left in their day. Once we got up to the counter, there was no hello or smile, just what can I get you. We ordered 2 Soy Lattes and the first thing the barista says is they don't know if they have any soy left. I'm sorry but you are a Starbucks located in a mall, how do you run out of an essential item like soy or any type of milk like product half way through you day?? After checking with other workers, they said there is just enough for us but then they are out. Awesome. We at least got our soy lattes but what about everyone else for the next 4 hours they are open? It is like saying they ran out of half and half. I'm sorry but a Starbucks should not run out of certain things and creamers are one of them.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Jan 7, 2018~I love Starbucks no matter the location but as the Kierland Starbucks location is closest to my office, it is the one I most visit! With that said I love the staff here as they are very friendly and always remember my order!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Mar 20, 2012~Positively the snobbiest Starbucks I've ever been to. Get over yourselves and crack a smile, for goodness sake!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Jan 21, 2014~A perfect Starbucks outting is quick and efficient. Some Starbucks brew a slightly burnt coffee. This one consistency has delicious brew and can get me in and out in minutes. Thanks again team! Could probably change the trash out more often, people go for the recycle bin but it's usually full so they default to the trash side. No biggie.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Feb 26, 2011~Its your typical Starbucks. The coffee is hot, the service is fast and they are always busy. Know what you want before you get to the counter please it speeds things up for all of us :)
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~~Love this Starbucks for the business vibe! Lots of meetings going on. More than enough outlets for your laptop, but always crowded, so finding one is tough. Love the upscale feel.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~~Great place to hang out and have a coffee. That is if you  can find a table. This place gets packed. Can't beat Kierland for the environment.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~~One of the toughest tables to get in Scottsdale...sort of feels like a walking on a runway...Oh, and they've got coffee.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 12, 2012~My favorite Starbucks to go and have coffee. Very friendly baristas and place is very clean.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Apr 22, 2014~It's an alright place. It's down the street from me. Sometimes I grab my laptop and go over there to do some work. The wifi can get a little slow at times. But over all good.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jul 31, 2013~This place used to be great. But lately it's almost always a mess. Furniture and chairs strewn around, overflowing garbage cans and old newspapers laying around are the norm.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Feb 22, 2015~Always super quick drive thru and the staff is always so nice and upbeat - even on a super early Monday morning. Always a plus! Only reason I'm not giving a 5 star is because getting into their drive thru and leaving to head north on Scottsdale Rd is difficult.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jun 30, 2013~This Starbucks in Kierland Commons has an excellent staff of baristas that offer stellar customer service!!! They have to endure some challenging and demanding customers to say the least, often in a tight schedule, and they do an excellent job of providing the timely customer service needed!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Dec 29, 2014~I go to this location often because it's a mile from my house and I like to study here. Employees are okay, not too friendly and don't go out of their way to make customers feel special/welcome. It's usually crowded, a lot of business people go in there for meetings/lunch I've noticed. The line is often out the door, which is a given for the convenient location. The drinks are anything special, I've never had something made for me that was to die for. The self service station with napkins and what not is always a mess, as expected due to how busy they always are. Same with the restrooms, they need to be doing restroom checks more often then they are. I wish they would remodel to make it bigger but that's not possible. It's a beautiful store with lots of seating that's always full.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jul 22, 2014~Great location and always friendly. Every once in awhile, there's a barista who stands out.  Kudos to Georgia at the Kierland Commons Starbucks in Scottsdale, AZ.  So friendly and professional.  What a joy!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~~I've been coming to this particular Starbucks for years. It's in Kierland which is convenient. Mostly, I find it a place for people watching. It's always crowded and the lines are long. The customer service isn't great, not friendly at all. Drinks are usually correct, but I have even had iced coffee with milk get screwed up. Really...coffee, milk then ice. It's not that difficult. The reason I'm writing a review right now is because of a particularly strange experience last night. My boyfriend and I came in for an Americano. The strange, socially awkward barista completely left us at the register, with no one in line, her back turned to us while she busied herself pouring coffee from pitcher to pitcher. She said to wait. We were waiting 5 min! I think whatever she was doing could've waited until she took are 2 orders. Someone else finally came to take or order. It was completely rude and annoying. Starbucks should really chose their employees a little better. People skills are important. Customers should come first.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~~I arrived at around three, there was one lady ahead of me at the end of the counter already waiting for her drink. Sadly the barista was too busy flirting to notice I was in my work uniform and clearly on a break. Ten minutes later I get a cup two thirds of the way full of watered down chai. I don't know if he put skim milk in there or what, but I asked for whole milk and was very disappointed in what I got. It shouldn't take ten minutes to make a full decent cup of chai, let alone part of a poor one. Give me a break. I watched him and he was talking, not paying attention to what he was doing and stopped several times to chat with another lady while making my drink. It's no wonder I prefer Dutch Brothers.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~~Great location, and decent service. Must admit I like the Dbros coffee better, and they make a real effort to remember your name/drink. Maybe not as many regulars??  Not sure,  location is the best part.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Feb 4, 2015~Starbucks as always. My barista was awesome last time I went in. She misspelled my name and felt bad so she gave me a free scone! Never had that happen, but I can't complain. Great Location for the Old Town Crowd!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Feb 8, 2023~I work near this Starbucks so we frequent this location often the baristas are always friendly and efficient even thought they are always so busy !
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Sep 7, 2019~Place is a joke. Understaffed, burnt coffee, not even a good pit stop when you're grocery shopping.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Sep 14, 2024~It's pumpkin season!!! Got my first pumpkin latte today but.... found out they do serve it year round!! It's so yummy y'all!!!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 9, 2024~Dennis is amazing. He is so friendly and truly seems to care about our drink order. It is refreshing to see someone in the service industry live their job. Thank you, Dennis!!!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jun 12, 2022~I am a Frequent almost everyday visitor to Starbucks.This is my second visit , my first was The Drive ThruI knew a Barista who transferred from the Store on Tatum Boulevard opposite from the defunct Paradise Valley Mall. I have lived in the PVMALL area for 3 1/2 Years.The derive here was impeccable as usual!  As soon as I entered I was welcomed in. My order was taken ASAP &amp; done before I finished  paying for the sale. The Manager and I use the same barber since we are both Bald. Great sense of Humor. Best Customer Service.I look for the Good in others not looking to complain.From here I am headed across street to Volunteer and Attend the 11:00 AM Service at Impact Church..Stop in
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Jan 19, 2022~This is a nice SB at very convenient Thunderbird and Scottsdale shopping center and across from the Scottsdale airport. It's fun watching the jets flying over. Staff is on point. Seating is comfy, there's a drive thru. Only negatives are its small and parking nearby is iffy.I also had a nice pasta lunch at Giuseppes in the same shopping center.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jul 20, 2023~Our family visits this starbucks more than three times per week. Lately the price for the same drink has gone up another dollar for `"light ice`". The drink was already overpriced since it is already 90% water. We called corporate to inquire and were told that each store sets their own policy for charging or not charging for `"light ice`". So if you are looking for a Strawberry refresher visit another nearby location. You may save yourself a little $$. Oh, and the phrase  `"the machine is going to ask you a quick question`" is tired. Start paying your employees better and stop making your customers uncomfortable.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Nov 14, 2023~Went to this Starbucks on 11/14 &amp; had a wonderful experience. Not super busy, it was quiet, and clean. Every worker there was friendly &amp; welcome us all in. Drinks were fast to receive &amp; tasted delicious. Will definitely come back!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Jun 12, 2023~The person taking my order today was not friendly at all. I only stop by this location occasionally and I was not impressed although my drink was pretty good. The store is clean and has a nice layout with clean restrooms but that's about it.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Dec 1, 2023~Always out of seasonal flavors. Happened on 4 separate occasions, whoever is in charge of the ordering for this store is lost. Coffee tastes weak. Avoid and go to a different one if possible. Staff was friendly who I directly dealt with.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Sep 2, 2020~I had a few minutes to kill before the shop on this plaza I wanted to go to opened so I headed on over to this Starbucks to indulge in one of their tasty cold drinks. After looking at the menu online I knew I wanted the star drink. I didn't see it on the menu but the barista had no problems placing the order. The shop has very thorough social distancing measures in place and my drink was made very quickly. The star drink was delicious and refreshing. I could taste both the kiwi and starfruit juice and there were dried pieces of kiwi in it for some extra fruity flavor. A Star is Born in this star drink from Starbucks!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Sep 13, 2018~The drinks are refreshing and tasty. I love the customer service and they are normally fast and quality top notch. The only complaint is the price.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Dec 12, 2020~One of the faster Starbucks drive thrus around. And rumor is, Starbucks will be passing out peppermint mocha care fresheners? That's a win. Starbucks drive throughs are a game changer
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Dec 22, 2021~10/10 I got a iced caramel latte it was amazing and delicious. Great customer service!!!! I appreciate
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Mar 16, 2020~Look for `"Monte `" AMAZING customer service really went above and beyond to accommodate my wife and I Not only had a smile but also had class with profession !
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Oct 11, 2018~This is the only Starbucks location that gives me literally half of a shot or less in a latte... every single time. Going to stick with the Chauncey and Scottsdale Rd location from now on.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jul 25, 2018~This is how they rip u off they filled 3/4 my grande cup with ice then added the ice tea So i primarily paid 3 bucks for a cup of iceWould not recommend this store
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Feb 7, 2018~Awful. Always awful experience with customer service, drinks and food at this location. I do Starbucks daily and this one sucks. No protein box, no banana bread, then they give me my stale lemon loaf, and pink drink that has no strawberries. She hands it to me and sees me look at it then tells me, `"we don't have strawberries that's ok right?`" Yea thanks I like paying $6 for a drink that I didn't order. Never again at this location.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jan 11, 2022~Say there open at 4:30 but came here at 6:30 and they were closed. A Starbucks closed at 6:30. Don't come to this one if your on your way out of town in the morning they won't be open.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Oct 27, 2019~These guys told me they were `"out of dark roast today. What's with Starbucks not having dark roast before 11am on a Sunday? It's so dumb. It's so cheap to have brewed coffee sitting there and Pike is terrible. Ridiculous that they've abandoned real (ie dark) coffee drinkers.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jul 7, 2020~Are we open? Are we not open? This store doesn't seem to know. Placed a mobile order the other day and despite the door having a sign requiring masks on entry, the lobby was closed and I was not waiting in the drive thru line that was 5 cars deep to get my mobile order. Then I went this morning and the drive thru is now blocked off but there are signs all over the outside of the building that say `"welcome back.`" Make your minds.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Sep 20, 2021~An amazing location the cashier was wonderful (I wish I remembered their name!)  and so kind and remembered my name which I though was sweet! Quick and effortless!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 30, 2019~Love a Starbucks. You can't really go wrong and this spot is right by my yoga studio, so I'm always stopping in.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 18, 2021~They make the best brown sugar oat milk shaken espressos out of all of the locations. Sandwiches are always perfectly heated up and the line moves very quickly. There are 3 Starbucks on my way to this one but I drive out of my way just to go to this location. My dog loves their puppacinos too.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Feb 16, 2019~This specific Starbucks location was very kind, polite and quick. The guy who checked me out, made sure he spelt my name right and even double ok more like triple checked my order. I can get coffee anywhere but good service is hard to come by these days.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~May 22, 2013~New Starbucks! It's on my way to work and, more importantly, on the West side of the street making it an easy stop off for me. The drive-thru isn't bad getting in and out of, unless the line is getting long. Drinks are speedy and the employees are cheerful. Pretty normal. Grande peppermint hot chocolate, please!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Aug 20, 2018~This is probably one of the worst experience I have had with Starbucks for awhile now. Considering I get coffee about almost everyday from Starbucks. I came through the drive thru on a Wednesday morning and had my own personal Starbucks cup.Ordered my drink and notified them I have my own cup. I came up to the window for my drink and one of the gal gave me a Starbucks drink in their plastic cup. I let her know I have my own personalized cup and handed her my cup. She then gave me the plastic cup and told me that she had to give me the plastic cup. No way she can get the drink in my Starbucks cup that I bought at Starbucks. This is also an updated review I had to stop this morning.Same thing happened they said that they cannot pour my drink in my own personal cup because it's a little more difficult to pour the drink into my personalized cup since there is a line. So let me ask you this, why sell a Starbucks cup to a client if you cannot get their drink into the personalized cup unless they walked inside. This is a very very disappointing! why do I have to take my time to pour my drink from your plastic cup into my personal cup that I bought from you and then stop my car after I go through the drive-through and throw away The plastic cup that you handed to me? wasting my time through the drive-through, waiting for my turn? I think as a customer I waited through the drive-through I should have my time when I am at the window. I've never had that experience before except at this particular Starbucks. Sadly it seems like Customer service does not matter here.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jul 5, 2018~This entire Starbucks is trash. I came with my son to get drinks and they spent over 12 minutes making my frappucino!! I had to get my son to the doctor because he was suffering from a gunshot wound but if he died he wanted one last frappucino. There was little to no business that day and I think I saw employees hitting a juul instead of working the drive thru. Everyone there had disgusting haircuts and looked so unprofessional, and the coffee was so bad anyways. Never coming here again, don't even bother wasting your time.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Nov 21, 2018~Worst Starbucks ever! Friendly people but they can't get an order right to save their lives. I have given them several chances, and only come here because I work close. Won't come again.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Mar 9, 2019~Walking into this Starbucks this morning was like finding a mirage in the desert. It was cold outside and we walked into a warm and cozy `"living room`" filled with the delicious aroma of coffee and baked goods. Everything was clean and the food cases were fully stocked- even the music was uplifting. The best thing of all was the friendly staff who seemed to be enjoying doing what they do. Their teamwork and fun banter was an awesome sight to see and it felt good to be `"seen`" by them and treated so warmly. Oh- and the coffee was wonderful too! Definitely one of the best Starbucks I've ever been to.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Jul 20, 2016~This is a typical Starbucks with plenty of seating and drive thru service. Only downside is that they lack the Starbucks music that most locations play.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Oct 29, 2020~This Starbucks offers mobile order convenience but, keeps the orders behind plexiglass which defeats the purpose.  Especially when the employees ignore you when you enter and when you wait at the counter to ask for your order. The only other customer in the store ordered his coffee and received his order while I was still waiting to be acknowledged and handed my mobile order.  When I asked for my order it seemed to inconvenience the employee so much that when she slammed my coffees on the counter they spilled out all over the lids and onto the counter inconveniencing her so much she only replaced one of the lids and left the other filled with coffee.   I asked for stoppers and this upset her even more.  After having similar experiences at this location a couple of times I will drive out of my way to go to a different Starbucks.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Oct 5, 2017~I love this Starbucks! I usually stop by the drive thru in the mornings and service is quick and easy. I've never had any issues. I usually order a tea for later and a coffee for the morning. Today I checked in and became the duchess, who would've thought? Lol. Anyway, if you're in the area and need a little `"pick me up`" definitely stop by this Starbucks for quick and great service.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Feb 17, 2017~I'm an avid customer here, purely for convenience but after today not anymore. I always go through the drive thru and the girls that run the window are extremely rude. I've gotten maybe two good experiences in the past 5 months of going here. I get it. It's stressful, as someone who has worked in the customer service industry for a bit and finally got out, I totally understand. But the terrible part is that the whole idea is to not take it out on customers who did nothing wrong to you. I tip the girls who are nice but other than that, not the best. They work like they hate it there and want nothing to do with you... Plus they've gotten my order wrong several times to where they give me the wrong items, or to where they try and hand me a small cup for something I paid to get in a Venti size. I think I'll take my business elsewhere.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Aug 23, 2018~8/22/18 Horrible! Spent 10 mins in the drive through At 7:10pm saying `"Hello???`" So drive to the window where the employee is laughing and when I asked to come to the window shakes her head `"No`" while smiling!? THEN says we're closed! I asked (all while signing the best I could because she still wouldn't come to the window to answer any questions) `"When did your hours change??`" Since I frequent this Starbucks before work every Wednesday at 7:15 pm...replied with laughter `"I don't know?? Maybe two weeks ago??`" The NEW hours should have been posted on the drive through, or a courtesy response from the employee that they were closed. OR at least any help from the employee 10 minutes after new hours closing to inform frequenting customers! Very rude and unhappy with the experience
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jul 25, 2019~If I could give zero starts I would. Apparently this location closes at 7 PM which is incredibly confusing to me because that's really early in my book. But what's most frustrating is that when you go through the drive-through there's absolutely no hint that they're closed. I sat there for a few minutes before deciding to pull up to the window at which point the employee mopping the floors looked at me multiple times and never came over to ask me what I needed during the entire couple of minutes I was sitting there staring at him. I still didn't know they were closed at this point because there's no signs or indication in the drive-through or the drive-through window. I decided to call and the chick that answered was really curt and a little condescending when she let me know they were closed. I let her know it would be a good idea to have some kind of signage or indication in the drive-through to let people know especially since again 7 o'clock is pretty early. She replied `"well there's an hours sign on the front door`" and I repeated that I was not at the front door but in the drive-through and that in the drive-through is where there should be an indication and she replied with a very sarcastic `"OK.`" Which instantly pissed me off so this location isn't getting my business anymore. I know it won't hurt them but it's the principle of the thing lol. ****Managers at this location, please educate your staff on how to give good customer service because with all the competition out there I doubt you want your staff being unprofessional, rude and pissing off your customers.****
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jan 15, 2018~Had the most unbelievable experience at this location today. First, I go to Starbucks just about every single day. I live in the south east valley so I tend to go near my home but, I have been going to Starbucks daily for years so I have a pretty good understanding of how things work. So, I went into this location today with my daughter. I ordered two tall Americanos in grande cups with room. I understand this can be a little bit of a confusing order so when I get there, both our cups are only half full. I very politely asked the barista (Dyllon) if I could possibly have some more water in each of the cups and asked if he could possibly leave an inch of room. He put the extra water in the cups and handed it to us. There was no carafe of half and half out so I asked if I could please have some cream. He takes a tiny little child's cup and puts about a tablespoon of half and half in the cup.  I pour the tablespoon into one of the cups of coffee and then asked the barista if I could have some more... Keeping in mind I have 2 cups of coffee. He puts another tablespoon of half-and-half in the little child's cup and hands it to me. I put that half-and-half in the same cup I put the other tablespoon of half-and-half and then asked the barista if I could please have some more cream as I have 2 cups of coffee. He tells me at this point he would normally have to charge me for the half-and-half. I asked him to please clarify what he meant and he said that the amount of half-and-half that I was requesting requires that they charge me. What!?!? I have gone to Starbucks daily for years and never, ever have I heard of anything like this. So I told the barista that... that I am a daily customer and I have never heard anything like that. He tells me he is a manager and that is the policy.  He then goes over and whispers to another barista who comes over to me.So I asked the other barista if that was indeed correct and she advised me that yes, anything over 4 ounces of half-and-half means that they will charge you. OK... I didn't even have 4 ounces of room in the 2 cups of coffee that I was asking to put cream into. I explained this to her... That I had asked for an inch of room. An inch of room gave me about 2 tablespoons of cream in each cup of coffee... Certainly not the 8 ounces I would have been entitled to having purchased 2 cups of coffee if indeed the `"4 ounces of cream per cup of coffee`" rule was even true. And even if it was true, how could they ever possibly enforce that? Most Starbucks put a carafe of cream out and you can just add it to your coffee. Could not even believe this whole experience.  Ridiculously rude baristas with terrible customer service.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Mar 9, 2016~My boyfriend and I are avid Starbucks customers.. (twice a day at least) Every time we have been to this location we have been treated rudely by the same two girls that seem to run the counter (Taylor &amp; Tori) Taylor has been so rude to the point of putting her finger in my boyfriends face telling him to `"hold on`"And on top of that they never seem to get you drink orders correct. Today I will give you an example of how we ordered 3 drinks, got two of them and waited for the easiest drink for a good 5 minutes. A red eye.. (Brewed coffee with one shot of espresso)  I would highly recommend going to the Starbucks on thunderbird and Tatum if you're in the neighborhood. They are awesome!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jul 10, 2018~Visiting from back home, to see my mother who was sick. The barista named Gunner and I hit it off right away (he's a Michigan fan, me Ohio state) I don't visit Starbucks often back home but this young man made me feel more welcome at a time I really needed it. And it was genuine ... I hope his manager sees this and tells him how much I appreciated his comfort... I will be sending an email to the DM of this location about his service
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Nov 16, 2016~Came early in the morning and the staff seemed pre-occupied. No green sticks available. I didn't bother asking. I do like that this one has a drive-thru though in case I'm in a hurry since this location is on my way to work!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Dec 4, 2018~Friendliest Starbucks I've been to and super cozy. Perfect place to chill and get work done, and the Christmas music doesn't hurt either
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Nov 14, 2016~The afternoon staff is super rude, on regular basis. Some of the employees have been cool but those are the ones I haven't seen again. Quit? My mom and I actually avoid this place because of the attitude problem. There's plenty of other ones, not very close to this one, but we still avoid it and make the drive to somewhere else. Kids, if you're unhappy with your life, do something about it, no need to take it out on happy customers.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Nov 19, 2013~The food and beverages are always predictably good, the staff are always predictably friendly, and the seating is very much adequate. My only complaint, otherwise I'd give 4 or 5 stars, is the Internet access is super flaky. I'd come here to work but after far too many lost VPN connections there is absolutely no way I could trust this Wi-Fi service with my job duties. (In fact, I had to post this with the PotBelly WiFi because the Starbucks connection went down while logging into yelp.)
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jul 17, 2016~I've been frequenting this location 2-3 times a week for about a year now. Went in on Saturday 7/16/16 at 1:30 p.m. &amp; ordered a trenta black tea. Sat outside &amp; ate my sandwich from Potbelly. when I went back inside at 1:45 p.m. &amp; asked for a refill, a very rude person claiming to be the manager (Gunnar) told me I was not eligible for a refill because I walked out the doors and left the premises. I argued with him explaining that the sticker on my cup indicates I purchased my drink 15 mins before &amp; the tables outside are for customers. How can he say I left the premises. It's not like I got in my car and drove away. What a putz !  After arguing, he said he would make an exception `"This one time`", but in the future I would be denied my refill if I walked out of the store. Unbelievable !! This idiot is willing to lose $12 a week from my business for a .54 cent refill - I believe this is the definition of a terrible manager. Recommend you try any store other than this one....
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jun 5, 2013~GREAT new location!  I am amazed how many Starbucks are in the Scottsdale area but here's another one!  The new one has a great layout with a good number of indoor seats.  It also has a drive through which is super convenient!  The drinks are made well, which I have come to expect from Starbucks and the baristas are helpful!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Sep 30, 2017~Well, just spoke on the phone to a girl named Taylor attempting to order a to-go carafe of coffee. I was told that they don't take orders over the phone during peak busy times and that I need to place my order through the app. Which is fine, I get it, you're busy. However, I've called this location before on a similar day and time of day, to order a carafe and they were able to take my order just fine. She also pretty much just hung up on me as I was politely saying `"ok thank you`" (for the information). Working in the customer service industry myself, I feel like thats a little lazy and unaccommodating. I'm a customer just like anyone else in your shop and would rather not have to wait the 20 minutes it takes to make a carafe. Long story short, called a different location and placed my order in half the time it took her to explain to me that I needed to download an app. Kierland Starbucks for the win!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Aug 26, 2013~Great new location, definitely a plus for the neighborhood.  Fast service, friendly staff, and great drink.  Can't beat it on a summer day like this.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Feb 11, 2014~Really like this new location.  Initially, service was the best, but now seems to be going through staff changes regularly with `"training tension`" and mistakes, slowing down the process.  Hopefully, this location will come back into it's own.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Oct 9, 2014~I was there this morning, I asked for lg ice coffee, 3 classic first then ice then coffee and 3 more classic w/a little cream.  The barista that took my order was friendly, the barista who MADE my drink was rude, when I mentioned it was to white for my taste she looked at me and then proceeded to throw the drink in the sink, really in a pissed off manner.  I again requested how I would like it made, again she was pissed off and rude.  It was not made correctly but I took it anyway after she slid it across the counter.  Don't think I would be back.  Unless the manager replies to this.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Dec 4, 2024~I go to a lot of Starbucks in the area, and this is by far the best one. They are so quick and the entire staff is friendly and kind. It's also always clean. I will always come to this location because of the staff!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Dec 3, 2023~Love me some Starbies.This location:Fast service.Happy employees. Great spinach feta eggwhite wrap that is our fave fast breakfast when on the run.Nice views of the mountains  outdoor seating.Parking: plenty
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Aug 13, 2024~The Starbucks at the N Scottsdale location is my go-to spot for breakfast. It's conveniently located near our apartment, making it the perfect stop to start my day with a good coffee and a bite to eat. Mornings can be busy, especially at the drive-thru, so expect a wait during peak hours.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~4~Feb 23, 2024~Great looking Starbucks in a busy part of Scottsdale. Great team working behind the counter. Clean bathrooms thanks for that.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~4~Jun 10, 2023~I'm in town visiting and needed some caffeine and a couple hours to wind down before meeting up with a large group for a retreat. There is a very spacious and open concept dining area with large windows which provide plenty of natural light. I had a barista/cashier named Larcy who is new and very sweet. Please give baristas grace and patience, it's not an easy job especially when they are new! Larcy was friendly and anything she did not know she made sure to figure it out! I had my usual on a really hot day, iced grande brown sugar oat milk shaken espresso with vanilla bean powder and it took a couple tries for them to figure out how to make it properly but it was worth the wait. All the staff there were very sweet and helpful. I would def return to this location.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~2~Aug 27, 2024~Stopped in for a coffee and it was very dirty, crumbs and paper on floors and dirty tables. Does not take long for an employee solve this
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Nov 9, 2023~Come on Starbucks you charged me over $6 for a tiny coffee cup that was only 3/4 full!! See pic. I hadn't had any yet!!! No more I'm done with you SB.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Mar 28, 2023~Very thankful they opened another location around the corner. They forget to mention they don't have something till after you order it. Oh we don't have those lids. They are specially for that drink type. I would have ordered another drink had I known. The type of lid is important to the drink type.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~4~Dec 21, 2020~This is a COVID-19 Take-Away Review. We have been coming to this location ever since it opened eighteen months ago. The only drawback is you'll never know how bad the drive-thru is until you make the turn and the Bank next door which also shares it. Starbucks is on the left as you enter. Very confusing. On the plus side as my recent photos show, they are very much with the program, with everyone masked up and behind Plexiglass partitions.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Nov 23, 2023~Incredible service! Wonderful food. The staff are amazing. Love this place. Best Starbucks in Scottsdale. Shell is the best! Thank you Shell and crew!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jun 25, 2017~Every time I come here, I'm treated with a smile and friendly service. All of my orders have been correct and they are quick &amp; efficient when it comes to moving a long line along. This new location is dangerously close to my home. I may need to invest in Starbucks in order to break even. Jokes aside, I am very happy to have them in my hood.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~4~Feb 1, 2019~I can never find a parking space here. It's always full. Also it's a really small. Interesting drive thru. The drive thru wasn't to bad around 10am.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Oct 28, 2018~The service at this Starbucks is phenomenal​. The staff is super welcoming. Greeted with a good morning when I walk in the door and if they happen to talk past when sitting at one of the tables​. Even some of the regular customers are greeted by name. The passion tea lemonade​ is always made perfectly every time I order it. Definitely​  making this my go-to​ study place for the morning time before work.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~4~Aug 18, 2018~I like this store, I frequent this store, and I  especially like that it is a Nitro cold brew location. I learned that not every store is a Nitro store and plain old cold Starbucks coffee is a sad and  far cry from the Nitro, foamy kind. I recommend it.My only suggestion for improvement is the chattiness of the servers at  the drive-through window--sometimes. Keep the line moving, stop chatting with customers so much (again, on those occasions when it happens) and get us in and out with our selections done so we can be on our way.Also, when I pull up at the speaker, ask `"Good morning, what can we get started for you today?`" not `"How are you today?`" It reminds me too much of when McDonald's asks through a speaker if I want the specialty of the month when all I want is a plain hamburger.If I answer with a curt, `"Fine.`" Now you know why.I just want the Nitro Brew you now have me craving and I want it sooner than later. I also want the person in the car behind me to get where they're going on time, too.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~4~Dec 14, 2018~I haven't made the transition from PSL to peppermint mocha yet. But this Starbucks is ready for the holiday. The atmosphere is always buzzing. There is a good combination of people hanging out, reading, and studying. Tons of seating options indoors and out. I ordered a psl which is obviously a 5star item and a chicken biscuit which I wasn't too crazy about. Will be back again soon
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Apr 12, 2020~Scottsdale &amp; Chauncey location. 04/12/20 - 11:15amThe guy working the drive through was very friendly and seemed to be genuinely happy. It was a refreshing experience. I was just expecting to go get coffee, not having my mood uplifted. Keep up the good work! The caramel frap was delicious.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Apr 29, 2021~I had amazing service this morning from Breanna. She was an positive ray of sunshine this morning when I went to get my coffee. Thankful for the many good baristas at this location.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Aug 22, 2019~I came in at 5:45 AM On 8/22/19 to order a decaf coffee. The girl was so rude and said what I have to do a pour over which I had no idea what that meant. So I ordered a decaf Americano instead. Not only was the register gal so rude when I handed her $100 bill and she said I can't break that so I said well I wanted to give you guys a tip and all I have is my app. Both her and the barista were a couple of sourpusses. I just went to Dutch Brothers yesterday and had the most incredible experience their competition. Starbucks could really learn how to train their employees better and give a better customer service service experience. Pretty disappointing! ---A long time Starbucks customer and stockholder
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~2~Oct 9, 2020~THEY DON'T ENFORCE MASK POLICYI've been coming to this Starbucks via the drive-thru since I moved to the area in Aug. I've never had a problem. However, this weekend I went on a Saturday morning walk with my wife and dog and we decided to stop here for a coffee and pastry. We made sure to bring our masks. I was very surprised to see that not just one, but two people in the store not wearing a mask. One person was sitting on the bench and o saw them walk around here and there (didn't seem like a customer) and then another gentleman standing in the middle of everyone. There was a sign on the door stating that masks were required and I even saw masks sitting in a basket by the door. NOT ONE staff member at this store said a thing to either person for not wearing a mask, especially with so many guest in the lobby. That was all I needed to see. I will NOT be coming back to this location. If they enforces the rule, then I will protect my family and go elsewhere. Plus, there's a new Starbucks on Mayo that just opened and it's closer anyways. Definitely not going out of my way for this location.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jun 22, 2017~It's my understanding they're the only Starbucks and the metro area that does nitro cold brew!!!Loads of caffeine!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Mar 21, 2020~I love going to this Starbucks. The staff is nice and caring, specifically the boy with Harry Potter glasses!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~May 23, 2018~Every time I come to this Starbucks it's always the same smiling face that provides excellent service for me! He's always so cheerful and goes the extra mile to converse with me while the other employees make my order. I always get a unsweetened iced green tea and whatever drinks my coworkers like. Fast and friendly service. All Starbucks should be this way!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Oct 2, 2017~I love this new Starbucks location. Would be neat to live in the condos next to it, as you also have walking access to a new fitness center, health food and supplement stores and a new Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers. This Starbucks' staff is especially friendly. I notice they already know regulars names and make each experience warm and personal. Today I went for the new nitro cold brew with sweet cream added. It was really good- definitely offered me the caffeine pick up I was looking for with a little a smoother blend and slightly sweeter than my regular cold brew. Though I'm glad I tried it, I'll probably stick to my normal, no calorie cold brew in the future, as I don't like to drink my calories. About $5 for a grande.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jul 22, 2017~One of the nicest Starbucks!  The coffee is good, but lately my wife got me on a refreshers kick.  Also great.The baristas here are friendly and love their new spot.  Thanks for the service and for my new addiction!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~2~Apr 15, 2019~I absolutely love this Starbucks and go here all the time but was disappointed this morning with the new iced caramel cloud macchiato. I placed an order this morning through the mobile app, picked up my drink and drove 10 min to work. By the time I arrived at work this is what my drink looked like - it looks like someone drank half of it and I hadn't even touched it! I don't know what happened but I paid for a grande and basically got a tall.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~4~Feb 7, 2021~I was pissed as I drove off and got to the park and just realized that the barista didn't give me my 6$ in change back. My bill was 4.81 and I gave her 10.81 and she gave me my coffee and not my change. That wasn't a tip !!!!So after the dog park I drove over to the place and explained to them what happened and the nice manager was able to correct the issue Thank you so much
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jul 9, 2018~This is my go-to Starbucks location, which says a lot as I've probably visited just about every Starbucks around! The drive-thru never fails me I'll have 15 minutes to get to work and I'm in and out within minutes for a quick coffee! I've sat-in multiple times to study or enjoy a cold brew on the patio (which is actually quite nice and spacious!) I've also ordered on the Starbucks app and picked my order up at this location- so convenient! My order is always ready waiting for me whether I give the baristas a 5minute or 10minute head start on my orders. Quality and efficiency in drinks + customer service- 5 stars!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~4~Jun 15, 2019~This location is new and has a drive through. There's also plenty of seating and free WiFi. The staff is quick and friendly. I ordered a venti pink drink here and it was delicious.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~2~Apr 12, 2020~I ordered a Medicine ball drink and they handed to me the lid popped open and My whole leg got covered in burning tea. The lid didn't even fit the cup they gave me. Not to thrilled with this Starbucks.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jun 21, 2018~Wow! Is this Starbucks rockin! Every time I come through the drive through in the mornings they get it done! Great job everyone! You pushed through the line of cars I was 9-10 cars deep and you got me through in 5min! I timed it! Every time! Keep up the hard work because it is noticed, you got me to work on time with my grande breve 4 agave nectar latte and I'm happy!  The other sbuxs better up their game because you guys are setting the bar pretty high! High five AM team - loyal sbux guest 06/21/2018 7:45am
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~May 1, 2019~Perfect location down the road from my house. I regularly come to work remotely while enjoying free WiFi and coffee! Mornings and late afternoons can be busy but between outdoor and indoor seating, I normally always find a spot. Parking however can get crowded all throughout the day!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~2~Mar 2, 2020~Very rude drive-thru rep at this location (guy who wears Harry Potter looking glasses). Have had one encounter with him before tonight where he was rude because he `"could not understand what I was ordering.`" Then, tonight I show up with about 10 minutes or so before the location closes at 7:30pm and the same guy who helped me before was frustrated because he forgot two items that I ordered (on the receipt for proof) and when I asked for them he rolled his eyes and shook his head at me. Would recommend avoiding this individual. The Grayhawk location on Hayden and Thompson Peak has great customer service and would recommend going there if it's not too far out of the way for you.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~2~Dec 16, 2019~I live right next door to this Starbucks which could be awesome!  Everyone I have ever had to deal with here has been very friendly.  However the consistency of drinks I would give a negative star for.  I feel like I'm back at McDonald's where they just cant seem to get it together.  Your staff needs to learn their drinks better.  I order the same thing everytime and I have had it made right one day.  The other days it comes out dark brown and other times it comes out almost white.  I order a vanilla sweet cream cold brew.  Not anything to difficult.  I have just stopped coming to Starbucks. And really ask myself if I want to just throw my money away.  The last Starbucks I had yesterday I literally just threw in the garbage and didn't even drink it.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Sep 21, 2017~Super-fast and friendly service!  It's never really crowded, which I like considering the location.  If you want to have a nice cup of coffee, while studying or working on something, this is your Starbucks.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Apr 10, 2021~Everyday, the music outside is blaring loud. Have to scream at the people sitting with you in order to communicate.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Nov 27, 2017~My drink always tastes gross, it's sad because in the mornings all you want is a good drink. So sad that this is the closest one to my work. I've throw so much money away since I don't have time to return to get it remade. So upset.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jun 3, 2017~I love the new Starbucks on North Scottsdale and Mayo Blvd. They've been open for only couple weeks and I've been there 3 times already! What sets them different from the other Starbucks is not their awesome architecture, but their friendly workers who make casual conversations while waiting at the drive thru. I highly suggest this Starbucks!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Feb 24, 2019~This is by far the most amazing store I have ever set foot in my whole life. I have never experienced a more perfect atmosphere with such an amazingly friendly staff. I was especially warmly greeted by this stunningly extravagant young man Audi. I am so glad to have experienced the love of my life in this store. The Chauncey Starbucks will forever be my go to place for coffee!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~4~Nov 29, 2017~It's hard to differentiate one Starbucks from another. And that's the case here. This, like many of them, it's a great place to meet for business and or to have that initial coffee date with someone you met online. The staff is friendly and they get people through the line quickly
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~4~Aug 18, 2017~Very nice, new and spotlessly clean. Service is friendly and professional. Could use more seating though.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Oct 31, 2019~This is my favorite Starbucks in the country, and I know this because I travel all over it.  My nitro brew always prepared fresh for me as soon as I walk in.  I only visit a few times a week over this past summer, but I'm alway greeted with the smiling face and kindness from Molly and Devin!  Special shout out to both these young ladies!  They start make my day!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Sep 14, 2020~Avoid this Starbucks!! Drink order is always wrong. Employees are always in bad moods. Drive thru takes FOREVER. Poorly designed parking lot/drive thru. It really is the worst I've ever been to.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Sep 11, 2020~Drive thru is an average of 15 minutes for me. No consistency even when I order the exact same thing each time.  Worth it to drive to a different location!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~3~May 15, 2018~3 stars since they haven't messed up my drink order yet but their drive thru is suuuuuper slow. Don't come here if you're cutting it close to getting to work on time.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Oct 7, 2019~This is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to. They are extremely unprofessional and I ordered a bacon and Gouda sandwich and revived a cold sloppy sausage egg and cheddar sandwich. My drink is packed with ice and I can barely drink it. WILL NEVER GO BACK
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jun 1, 2017~The service is excellent, the staff is friendly, and the place is new and clean. It's hard to find a Starbucks with good wifi but this one has it! An added bonus is that they have nitro.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~May 19, 2017~Brand new Starbucks is open! But don't tell anybody, I want to keep it to myself. After today I probably won't be able to get a seat in here. This store replaces the Starbucks at 7000 E. Mayo (Scottsdale Rd &amp; Mayo). And they have nitro cold brew coffee here, if that's your thing. As the great patriot Patrick Henry would say: `"Give me latte or give me death!`"
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~3~Jun 12, 2019~On a few occasions, the employees at this location are less than pleasant. They seem super stressed and are very short when you ask them anything. Our order has also been wrong a couple times and by the time we figured it out, we were already down the road. For now, we will skip this location and make our Starbucks stops at another location. Hopefully they cheer up and slow down so they can function at an optimal level.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jun 14, 2019~This is my favorite Starbucks! They are always so fast and have such a clean store. This is a great location right off of Scottsdale Road as well.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jun 11, 2019~This is my favorite Starbucks! They not only have nitro, but they have amazing regular cold brew as well! I'm not sure what they do compared to other stores but this one wins hands down every time. I'm always excited to come here because I know the coffee will be consistent, amazing, and not too bitter. I'm very impressed with this location and the staff is always so friendly. I will always spend money here because it's worth it! Great work guys!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Jun 22, 2018~I have stopped at this location many times before work to get coffee for me and my coworker. This morning I ordered the same thing I always order: Iced Coffee with sugar free vanilla and a Hot Carmel Macchiato with extra Carmel. My iced coffee came out with SF cinnamon dolce. I was already at work when I noticed and did not have time to go back. My coworkers Carmel macchiato tasted like it had no coffee, just pure milk. It also had a minty taste to it. Like I said, I was already at work when we figured it out and I couldn't leave to return the drinks. I paid cash and I was not handed a receipt, so I don't have proof of these drinks. I will for sure think twice about which Starbucks location I will stop at next time. Both drinks were thrown away.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~May 10, 2018~Drive thru is inaccurate...and the drinks are hit or miss... I guess new location with new employees? but who wants to think about their coffee, I just want to drink it and think about other stuff... My coffee was literally 3/4 of the way full from drive-thru, had to turn around to go in and show them... the employee re-made it, and gave me a gift card for $5 (which doesn't cover the cost of what I ordered), when I looked at my debit card transactions on my phone... there were 2 pending charges from Starbucks... by this time I'm at work and just infuriated... Looked the store up on line and there was no phone number associated with this store location... called another location to see if they could help me and they couldn't locate the number either... finally found it on yelp... Jackie, store manager was nice and handled it for me but seriously?!?!?
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~3~Jan 5, 2018~Usually this Starbucks is pretty fast, but 3 of my last 4 Mobile orders were messed up. On two of them, they made my food but not the drink. On my last one, the food was on the mobile order stand when I arrived, but my drink was not. After waiting for 10 minutes I discovered they did not put the drink with my food. If I have to wait 10 to 15 minutes for a mobile order, it kind of defeats the purpose of ordering on my phone.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Apr 27, 2020~I went to this location because another location had mysteriously and suddenly shut down and their website said they were open until 7:00pm. When I arrived there was a hand written note on the drive thru that said they were closing at 5:00. Not sure how anyone would know about a note before they got there, that's why we have the internet, but that's fine because it was before 5:00 anyway. So I waited at the intercom. And waited. And waited. The employees were too lazy to take my order and apparently had decided they were finished working before 5:00.  You can go to this location and they might be open... or they might not be... who's to know? I won't waste my time on these people again.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~May 27, 2020~This is the friendliest cup of coffee in Scottsdale, AZ! Kim is just a hater that needs her clock times adjusted! They will take any order from customers that arrive ON TIME! That doesn't mean 5 minutes later... KIM!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Aug 12, 2017~This is my most favoritest Starbucks! I come here every morning before work and the drive thru is fast and the employees are always friendly. It's also pretty cool that you drive through the building which I think is why there's never a long line as you cant see the entrance from the parking lot unless you're right in front of it! I'm ok with it being hidden from everyone else!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Sep 16, 2017~I would give zero stars I would. I love Starbucks I probably go once a day and I have never been to such a horrible Starbucks! They put whipped cream on my Carmel frap when I asked for non which whatever it happens. But then they made my husbands drink as a hot and a grande when it was supposed to be cold and venti so the guys starts remaking it but makes it as a grande again. Then they forgot to give us straws and to top it off they didn't give me my banana nut bread. I've never seems so many mistakes. I will never go back
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Nov 20, 2017~By far my favorite Starbucks around!! The baristas are so sweet and engaging. I've never had my order come out wrong, so delicious!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Nov 22, 2018~Great drive through even big line moves fast. Does run out of plain bagels fast lol. The staff is extremely friendly.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Sep 9, 2018~Most coffee shops have access to drinking water. This is even more critical where we live.Biking/ walking here and waiting in line to get water is a pain in the butt.Otherwise nice simple coffee shop. Chill music. Closes early. Pretty good patio. Okay place to study. Boss Coffee up the street is better... but more out of the way. They keep it quite cold in there. Pack a sweater!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Jan 13, 2020~Not sure what's going on with this store lately, but I'm sure it's because of new management! TERRIBLE! These poor baristas look like they have to have smiles forced upon their faces 24/7 and have to say `"hi`" to everyone that comes through the door. It's ridiculous! Bring back the old manager! Happy staff=Happy customers!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jul 6, 2019~Great experience!! Very fast and enjoyable drive thru service from Reagan! Definitely will be coming back.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Oct 11, 2018~This is the fastest Starbucks ever, when I'm in a rush to get to work I can count on them. Very friendly staff too,  thanks you guys are awesome!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Oct 6, 2019~I asked for a specific drink (which I will admit is complicated) and the girl did not know how to make it. Another barista told her to just make a completely different drink?? Whatever, I didn't say anything even though it's not what I ordered. As I am waiting for the food they forgot to put in the oven and had to remind them I ordered, they call out someone else's order which they also made incorrectly.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~May 19, 2017~Same wonderful staff in a brand new, immaculate building with twice as much seating, both inside and out. And a drive thru lane.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Aug 21, 2017~Awesome brand-new location with a drive thru! Staff is very friendly and the coffee is very consistent. Love my new local SBUX!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Feb 7, 2018~Love Starbucks, their drinks are for the most part, always consistent no matter the location I visit. I'm obsessed with the mobile app and their Rewards program. Gotta earn those stars! :) Thanks for my morning pick-me-ups!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jun 28, 2017~The whole crew here is awesome! Always super helpful and speedy on those rushed mornings. Thanks guys! You rock
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Oct 12, 2017~All friendly staff and always welcome me with a smile. I get my usual drink and enjoy the atmosphere. They keep the place clean as best as possible considering they're busy serving patrons most of the time. Well managed.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Aug 25, 2017~This store has been open for just a few short months, but I literally go out of my way for my iced chai to visit this store! Every experience has been on the more than pleasant side of the counter. You can hear the sincerity in their voices. I have been greeted by comfortable small talk at the window on more than one occasion and you can tell the team takes care of their customers, to the point that the barista, Christian, acknowledged that I had a few free beverages stored up and reminded me to use one. This store is a solid operation and I will continue to earn more free drinks from this store, they just taste better when they're free.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jul 7, 2017~This is the best Starbucks I have ever been to!! The service is on a whole other level. They are quick and they get it right every time. The baristas at this location bring a whole new meaning to customer service. Each one has been so friendly and engaging. I would highly recommend everyone coming through Scottsdale stops by this location to see exactly what we need more of in this world! Thank-you to each of the baristas for the smiles and engaging conversation no matter what time of day!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~May 21, 2017~Beautiful new location with a super convenient drive thru! My favorite staff from the old location over on Mayo! So excited to have you guys right next door!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Sep 10, 2019~The absolute worst location I have ever been to. Have given them multiple chances to make up for it. Rude staff. Slow staff. Ordered my coffee at 7:32 stood there until 7:52 (had to be at work at 8:00) never got my coffee. Had to tell them I'll be back for my refund. 20 minutes to get a coffee is insane.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~Oct 2, 2019~Stopped in this morning shortly after 7am. There was no one in line. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and a Carmel Apple Spice. I proceeded to watch 4 people who ordered AFTER me pick up their orders, not to mention, the plethora of mobile orders that were prepared. I asked for the status of my order and the barista proceeded to act like she didn't know I had a drink order and not once while watching me stand there did she ask what I was waiting for. I watched the cashier grab two kiddie apple juice cartons from the cooler and finally after 20 minutes I had my order in hand. Staff in not engaging and clearly does not pay attention.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~1~May 30, 2018~Recently moved to Scottsdale so one of the first things I did was look up the closest Starbucks and this location was it. Unfortunately the drinks are very hit or miss here. I don't know what is going on but this the first Starbucks that has stood out to me that is not consistent. Countless re-made drinks. Decided to transition to The Coffee Bean down the road until this one gets better.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Apr 27, 2019~This Starbucks not only has the best baristas around town, but they also have the BEST bananas! I would buy a  bushel of these bananas over a grocery store in a heart beat! Good job Starbucks! Good coffee, good bananas.
Scottsdale, AZ 85255~5~Jul 24, 2018~The staff at this Starbucks is seriously amazing. They are always so friendly and helpful. I come here before work or during my breaks and the make my day a little bit brighter each time!
Cave Creek, AZ 85331~1~Dec 8, 2023~Lady just stands there biting her nails with her back to the line and makes drinks without washing her hands or wearing gloves. Also had no idea how to use the Starbucks app.
Cave Creek, AZ 85331~5~Dec 20, 2020~We love this location! We usually will grab Starbucks after grocery shopping. The ladies working this location are always so sweet and quick! They always have cake pops in stock, which are a hit with the kids.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Dec 15, 2022~OMG this guy is so annoying.He actually asked for a semi Dry whole milk cappuccino with extra foam and no lid.Um....what does heThink this is??? A coffee shop?Idiot...doesn't he know this isA hangout so I can talk aboutNothing and take selfies whilstI check the gram and complain About everything.... What wasThat??? Oh you said a SEMIDry...I thought I'd just give youWhat I want to make and getRid of you....GOD soooooooANNOYING!!! Oh forget about The two plastic lids you had toThrow away after you had toGo back to ask for another cupWhich came as dry as the desertWith NO FOAM!!! What a Waste...of perfectly crafted ATTITUDE!HE IS SO ANNOYING!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Dec 8, 2020~Ok what can I say that hasn't been said about Starbucks, the most popular coffee chain in the world?! Convenience &amp; consistency are the two biggest benefits. Different locations often reflect neighborhoods they're in, like the one at our local neighborhood Safeway. To be honest: Starbucks is not my first choice. However, given the current state of our local coffee shops - due to Covid-19, the majority CLOSE at 2 pm - I patronize Starbucks more often. Friday, Dec 4th was freezing &amp; I was jonesing for either a hot chai or a hot chocolate + some yummy baked good. I ordered their signature Peppermint Hot Chocolate and a Cranberry Bliss Bar. My drink delivered delicious flavors per the usual but it wasn't hot enough. In the past, when I mentioned that, they told me they didn't have a microwave &amp; they'd have to remake the entire drink. I didn't have time for that so I waited til I got home &amp; nuked it. I love the concept of the Cranberry Bliss Bar: one layer of blonde brownie studded with cranberries, topped by a second later of cream cheese frosting, laced with orange zest. My challenge? The ratio of cream cheese frosting to bar is excessive. I'd rather have a little frosting with my bar than the reverse. That's my preference. In the big picture, the combo of flavors and textures is excellent.  The staff here is super friendly and accommodating. One day I ordered a regular coffee and a slice of banana bread. The bread was dry/stale, maybe from sitting in the case. I mentioned it to the young woman working &amp; she switched it out for a yummy, fresh slice with no question. I appreciated that!Thumbs up to our local store for being open later than other coffee houses.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Oct 29, 2022~This place is horrible! Staff are so rude. No consistency and they can't seem to follow simple directions on a drink. I repeatedly have to ask for my drink to be remade every other time I go there. Then they take it personal and get more rude when you ask for a drink to be remade. The drive through is super slow. Overall this location is not good! Safeway on Osborn has Way Way better drinks and top service with it!!!! Starbucks wake up and get this location some major training and help!!!!! Smh
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Aug 24, 2021~Stopped at Safeway to do some grocery shopping and I would normally avoid Starbucks in grocery stores since I've had a few bad experiences but today I heard the most friendly voice behind the counter. I decided to get in line and I'm glad I did. Alyssa provided excellent customer service. She seemed very kind, patient and inviting and I feel like it is hard to come across that kind of customer service lately. My drink was great, but Alyssa really made that a positive experience and I'll be sure to stop by more often.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~May 19, 2018~Love Starbucks, and this new location is awesome. Modern industrial decor, tons of indoor seating, sizable patio, big parking lot, friendly staff, and your clothes won't smell like coffee after you leave. Also dig the funny vote-with-straw jar!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Apr 7, 2012~What can really be said about starbucks that hasn't already? What seems to be 10 years ago awesome coffee has turned into todays `"meh... ive had better.`"This is the location inside the safeway. I usually stick to a tea, but if you're looking for coffee close to this area, try Lux on central about .5 miles away.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Nov 15, 2012~Today I went to Starbucks for there BOGO free deal with my mom.  The lady at Starbucks was really nice.  I got my favorite peppermint mocha and my mom got eggnog latte.  It is nice to get a drink in Safeway.  Then you can in joy your coffee and do your grocery shopping at the same time.  :)
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~May 11, 2017~Mom and I happened to pass by this location when picking up a friend. I've never seen a Starbucks with this exterior design, but it is very nice! Went through the drive-thru. There were no cars in front of us. Wait for our drinks wasn't long at all either, it was reasonable. We ordered three drinks: a green tea frap, a green tea latte, and a passion tea. The passion tea was mine. I ordered a venti passion tea, no water, no cane sugar and 6 pumps classic syrup. They definitely disregarded my request for classic syrup because my tea had no flavor!! I like my teas sweet and this was the opposite of that.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 31, 2018~This is the second time we have gone through the drive thru and ordered drinks and our drinks taste nothing but milk. My iced caramel macchiato tasted nothing like espresso, it was pure milk. We also ordered an espresso frappe with an extra shot and it tasted nothing like espresso! It was pure milk as well! With this being the second time this has happened, I am completely unsatisfied and probably will never be returning to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 30, 2011~This is possibly one of the most ridiculous things that has ever occured to me in a `"coffee shop`".  This $tarbucks is located inside the Safeway at 7th Ave &amp; Osborn.  I rarely ever patronize a Sbucks, but my grandmother was wanting some coffee, so I obliged.  Being the coffee snob I am, I opted for a tea.  Even bagged tea is better than corporate coffee in my eyes (even if it's by the same company).I ordered an iced rooibos.  Tea.  Who can screw that up, right?  He made my grandmother's latte, which appeared `"fine`" (though one has to wonder) and proceeded onto my tea.Plastic cup.  Adds ice.  Fills with water.  Adds tea bag.  Swirls the cup around and hands it to me.  -- `"Do you want a second tea bag or something?`" -- `"Huh? What? Why would I need two tea bags?`"I stand there acting confused.  Did you expect ice water to create iced tea, or any tea at all?  I tell him he has to brew the tea, then dump it over ice.  He shoots back that he did *exactly* that.  I demand he remake it.  This time I told him to brew me the hot tea, give me a separate cup filled with ice, and I will deal with the tea steeping and such.  He does that, and I make my tea.  Ugh.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Nov 20, 2012~Love this Starbucks. The employees are always friendly and get your drinks promptly. Because it is in a Safeway, they may not have everything a standalone would have but that's okay.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Mar 11, 2018~I go to Starbucks often and I almost always have a positive experience.  This time was no exception.  I did the drive through thing and waited for a while because it was busy, but I didn't expect the service I got when I arrived at the window.  First I was informed that they were out of the drink I ordered, but then I was offered an alternative that ended up being better than what I ordered originally.  The gal who served me couldn't have been sweeter.  Thank you Megan for making my day.  You've made that Starbucks my favorite!!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Jun 30, 2016~Not necessarily the best location but the staff is great and willing to do whatever it takes to create a space for the wheelchair
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jun 25, 2015~If you like waiting in line for a minimum of 5-10 minutes this location is for you. Insanely short staffed, the staff is not qualified to handle a long line at the drive thru or standing in line. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WAITING FOR COFFEE!! Save you money buying the over-priced  coffee and go the The Urban Bean next store. WAY better coffee, no line and WAY better service.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Sep 4, 2015~Slowest service in town. Inside and drive thru. Wait time is longer than any Starbucks in town!
Scottsdale, AZ 85253~4~Feb 18, 2023~A great Starbucks at a beautiful resort. Prices aren't too bad and service is quick. Nothing is out of stock either which is great! Staff is friendly. Also connected to a gift shop too!
Scottsdale, AZ 85253~4~Dec 29, 2022~Great service, delicious drinks (like all Starbucks' so theres consistency), but hotel/not stripmall prices.
Scottsdale, AZ 85253~4~Oct 24, 2019~This Bux is located in the JW Marriott Camelback Inn. Since I'm a Starbucks person, I was super excited to see one here. The space isn't that large, but they offer almost everything that any other Bux would. While there's no seating inside, there are a few tables outdoors (or you can always sit in the lobby). I stopped here twice during my stay and both times I encountered friendly baristas who got my order correct.I would say the only negative about this Bux is that they're only open until 5pm. I can understand why since it's in a hotel rather than on the street, but it still made me scratch my head a bit. Besides that though, I thought this Bux was great and a total convenience for anyone staying at the hotel. I only wish my local Bux was as friendly and efficient.
Scottsdale, AZ 85253~5~Sep 3, 2014~Sweet little Starbucks tucked away in a quaint corner of this luxury Marriott resort. The baristas are very friendly. In addition to the full service coffee menu this location has a few breakfast options. Surrounded by fountains, flowers and views of Camel Back and Mummy mountains, this is the most relaxing place to enjoy a cup of morning coffee or iced drink.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Oct 13, 2023~I get the same `"iced americano`" everyday at different locations. This is the only location I always get a bad taste, definitely different beans or old espresso or something is off at this location.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Apr 21, 2021~I walked into this Starbucks on the street on the way to the Pie and Wine restaurant.First of all, there is no indoor seating area. They only have a drive thru and a walkup window.The Barista was very friendly. They do have a nice patio where I was able to sit and enjoy the weather.Recommended Starbucks if you don't want to sit inside.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 7, 2019~I love Starbucks and visit daily. Since I'm from the Midwest, I've never seen a brick and mortar without indoor seating. I was impressed actually. I needed somewhere to work so I came here and was surprised to see they only had patio seating. Unfortunately that wouldn't work for me today but on another day this would have been awesome. The best part, they have mist-ers outside so you don't get hot (awesome feature). The baristas were super friendly and quick
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Nov 22, 2021~This is a super weird location with no indoor space. They have indoor only christmas lights and extension cords outdoors however, which is hazardous.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Aug 1, 2018~This Starbucks doesn't have an inside you either order at the drive thru or order outside at the window. Love the caramel frappacino! Download the app to do mobile orders and get points for free drinks or food.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Jul 25, 2018~As many other reviews note, this Starbucks is mostly a drive thru operation. They have a walk up window and some outdoor seating, but this is mostly for people who want to grab and go. That being said, it's what you expect from a Starbucks. I've utilized the drive thru many times and they are always pretty quick, friendly and efficient and I've never had an issue with incorrect orders. I've gotten beverages and food items and am happy with the product and consistency. The only downside is logistically, if the drive thru line is long it can crowd the parking lot and spill into the street. But hey, as long as you're prepared it's all good!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Sep 1, 2021~After getting my IV I wanted to walk to the Giving Tree stopped here used the restroom and order a refresher for the rest of my walk... Quick Fast.  This place Is completely outdoors which is the first time I ever seen an outdoor Starbucks so it's like you're walking up to outdoor drive up window but it's not a drive up window is a walk up window pretty neat
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Oct 4, 2022~Very friendly staff! I interacted with three staff members and all were kind and helpful.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Jan 30, 2013~Not sure why there are such bad reviews for this location. As far as Starbucks go, it is pretty average (not especially bad). They get points knocked off due to the small size and lack of sitting/lounging space. You can only walk up or drive thru at this location :( But the drive thru is quick enough. I've never had any issues with my order getting mixed up or attitude from the baristas. I mostly visit in evenings or afternoon and it is never busy.  I've also been during morning hours, but not super early... so I can't comment on early morning rush.Seems like this low rating is partially skewed from people who don't like Starbucks coffee in general... understood, but I wish we could just filter out those reviews.  After all, we all know what Starbucks IS and ISN'T by now. Some of us need an accurate review of the location without coffee snobbery polluting the rating :P (see there ^^^ I included the smiley so my snobby coffee brethren can't take offense)
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Mar 21, 2021~Every single person that works at this Starbucks location is a literal angel sent from heaven
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Oct 5, 2019~This Starbucks is not a regular style store.  It's only a drive up or walk up type.  It's a Saturday morning around 7:30am and only 2 people are working.  The drive up line is long so I decided to park and walk up.  They are so busy I was told someone will be waiting on me shortly.  10 minutes I walk away!  For whatever reason they are short staffed and apparently running around like monkeys!  Unless you have lots of time to wait, go somewhere else!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Feb 18, 2021~Cute barista boy Hayden S. gave me my drink, love it here!! Drive through only, Will be coming back
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jan 30, 2021~I would like to start out by saying I am a fellow Starbucks partner (almost 6 years with the company). I go out of my way to go to this location. My son and I do our morning Starbucks run on Saturdays sometime between 10am and 11am. I get multiple complicated drinks, and every one comes out quick and correct.Now on to the service. Their customer connection is on point. They took the time to speak with me, as well as my son. Every time we pull out of the Drive Thru he says  `"I like them!`".  And it is important to note we have been helped at the window by a different person every time.I apologize, my son tends to keep my attention, so I was unable to get their names.Keep up the good work!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jan 23, 2021~Been standing outside the window for 10 minutes.  About 12 cars have passed me in the drive through lane.  Do not walk up.  You will not be a priority.  Lady told me not to ask how much longer and closed the window.  Ordered on the mobile app.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jul 15, 2017~My friendliest experience at a Starbucks ever. Drinks were same as ever but the nice young lady working drive through at 12 today was Fantastic
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~May 11, 2019~The manager at this Starbucks is probably one of the best managers I have ever encountered in a place like this. The manager deescalated a situation with a customer who's drink had been incorrectly prepared twice. Not only did the customer turn around completely but was in fact very pleased with the result. Instead of arguing with the customer the manager listened, fixed the order, and created an overall delightful experience out of an otherwise unpleasant one. Managers like this are needed in every team. I tip my hat off to you sir.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Jan 22, 2016~This location has a walk-up window, as well as a drive-through!  I usually drink at local coffee shops while in the valley, so I am not aware of current layouts of chain coffeeshops...  Pretty cool.  A coworker/friend gave me a Starbucks gift card (don't forget to register it online to collect perks!), so I decided to grab a tall (12 oz.) cup of brewed coffee on my way to visit nearby Zak's Chocolates.  I didn't have to wait at all, as a barista approached me as soon as I mustered `"hello.`"  Friendly service with a smile!Wouldn't mind returning, as long as I have gift cards to use.  :)
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Feb 24, 2014~Small Drive-thru and walk-up window at this location. Outdoor restroom with key access that was moderately clean. Drink was excellent and the outdoor seating area was small but adequate. The window staff were very friendly.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Sep 28, 2017~My frappe was melted and my chicken caprese had half of one piece of chicken and only one tomato for $6.75?! See picture. Then instead of a refund, they gave me only $4 back on a GIFT CARD, when I paid CASH!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~May 7, 2018~Horrible location.  I have been a true Starbucks fan and loyal customer for years.  I avoid this location like the plague.  They have NO process for picking up online orders, mess my order up all of the time and are horribly rude when you ask them to correct it.  Morning staff is absolutely the WORST!!!  Find another location.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Jun 1, 2016~This location doesn't have in-door seating, only drive and walk-up window.  There are few tables set up outside but who would sit there when the weather warms up? Probably skip this location next time. They also messed up my order. I ordered mango black tea but they added lemonade to it...too sweet for me. The staff is super friendly tho, the reason for 3 stars, not a 2.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Jan 26, 2016~They mess up my drinks all of the time. I only come here if I can't plan another location in my route. It's like all Starbucks as a whole though. I wish they would train their Baristas to ALL make the drinks the same so you know how to order your drink.Example: some are SUPER stingy on the Carmel... even when you ask for more!Then there's some that give you a good amount so when you order extra with them they over do it. It's a stupid thing to complain about based on everything else going on day to day but when you spend 6+ bucks for a cup of coffee and you are expecting it to be made the way you know you want and don't get it.... It kinda bugs you.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~May 19, 2015~One thing about Starbucks is that they are always consistent in the beverages.So if you are reading this review and have never been to a Starbucks we'll I can't help you there.My iced coffee (venti of course) was perfect and two pumps of classic syrup added the just right amount of sweetness.Not that I drink this 4-5 days per week!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~May 22, 2019~Impeccable service, jake helped me out! it was an amazing and fast experience! my drink was made very well!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Dec 11, 2015~Very disappointed that I had to pay extra for a holiday drink and my cup wasn't filled all the way... There is over an inch of room. When you pay extra for peppermint mocha bc it's a `"holiday`" drink, knowing you can order peppermint mocha year round and then you get shorted, it's upsetting.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jun 17, 2014~Always a quick, friendly drive through! And they make my iced mocha perfectly every time. Love this location. The only downfall is pulling into the parking lot, a lot of congestion right around the entrance.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Oct 13, 2014~This Starbucks is a drive-thru only with patio seating. Located on a corner with easy access to drive in and out the cute mini little Starbucks still offers all the great fixings Starbucks has to offer. A friend and I got the opportunity to dine here yesterday sitting out side sipping on our favorite Starbucks drink. The staff was friendly and our service was fast.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Apr 11, 2011~I wish I could give it a half of a star.. The only thing they do `"right`" is that they make some kind of drink for you.  It's probably not going to be what you ordered, but I guess there's always the option of going back, waiting in line for another 10 minutes, asking them to remake it, getting a dirty look about it, then finally getting it back 5 minutes later.Who wouldn't want to do that...?This is the closest location to my house; however, it is the LAST one I would choose to go to..  : /The set up is semi inconvenient, but I don't really go at the rush hour times of day, so I can't comment on that aspect.  SOME of the baristas are nice, but out of the 30 times I have gone there, I think my drink has been made correctly 6 or 7 times.  That kind of inaccuracy is not what I would expect from anywhere, much less such a well known company like Starbucks.But on the other hand, I don't HAVE to go to this location, it's just the most convenient, so I guess I should just suck it up and drive to a different location- like the one inside Desert Ridge.  I've never had a bad experience there.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Dec 22, 2019~This is the slowest Starbucks I think I have ever been to. I am currently on minute 17 waiting for one latte. Go to the grocery store one across street or drive to one 10 miles away and you will get your coffee quicker.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Feb 2, 2018~I went to pick up a mobile order, there was no one in front of me so it should have been really quick but they had no one to help and all four of them kept walking past me  and they had nothing to do but they weren't helping me i can't even believe they got hired i waited there for 10 minutes with no help and when they did they were rude and ignorant. i can't even believe i'm giving a one star it's ridicolous it should be zero stars
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Dec 26, 2018~Definitely one of my favorite Starbucks. Every time I come here my order is right and the staff is friendly. The drive through can be a little tough but it's definitely worth it
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Oct 2, 2014~This starbucks is incredibly B Team. I understand other locs being a little sluggish at off times but when I go at peak hours before work I have to ensure I have a solid 20 minutes to wait. They are slow at making drinks and always seem really confused. I avoid this location like the plague after giving it a shot 3 different times.Drive up the road to Coffee Bean or support local places around the area.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Sep 23, 2011~This is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to across all 50 states. 1. They can't multitask and serve multiple customers (it takes 20 minutes to get your drink). I don't care how busy you think you are; I have seen busier Starbucks figure it out. 2. When they make a drink with flavoring, they put the flavor in with the milk and steam it, this burns the syrup and spoils the drink. 3. No one smiles or says a simple 'thank you'. This Starbucks is less then a mile from my house (in walking distance) I am now a proud owner of a Tassimo.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Dec 29, 2018~Ordered thru the walk up window. Nothing complex, a latte. Waited 15 minutes before asking if the order was misplaced. Female employee with bright red hair color had it sitting right next to her for a while. When I asked how long that my order had been sitting there she snapped back `"I don't know, I just got here!`"  Crappy service. This Starbucks is the McDonalds coffee except they're more professional and friendly at McDonalds. Too bad Yelp doesn't offer zero stars.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Mar 22, 2011~You'll never find me rating a Starbucks lower than a 4, but this one is way too congested. Yes, the staff is friendly and it is convenient, the parking lot/drive through is a mess. This Starbucks is a drive thru - walkup window only. On busy mornings, you'll find yourself backed up onto the street just trying to drive in. If you decide to walk up, you need to park your car and get out. The drive-thru lane and parking lot overlap, which makes it hard to back-up out of your parking spot.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Sep 24, 2018~I always go to this starbucks before school and today I ordered a grande iced chai tea but they gave me the wrong order, a grande iced coffee. I was looking forward to the chai tea.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Jul 28, 2017~Service isn't the greatest. Not the nicest people working there. Drinks made well I guess
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Feb 1, 2016~This Starbucks is the slowest out there. No matter how many people are waiting, don't expect your visit to be a smooth ride. I almost always order through the Starbucks app. They screw up every time. They lose my order or give me half of it, or the wrong thing. This is apparently the only Starbucks location that has an issue with orders through the Starbucks app.  I will never go to this location again.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jan 4, 2014~I've been going here off and on for 5 years and the customer service here is amazing! I went on a no Starbucks strike for about a year not because I don't love my Starbucks but I purchased a very expensive espresso maker and wanted to get my money's worth from it.. Anyways I have a thing with touching cold stuff so I always get a sleeve on all of my iced drinks so after a year of being absent I drove thru the  drive thru ordered my venti iced Carmel macchiato and sure enough they remembered me and put my beloved sleeve on my drink! Love these guys especially the long haired skinny one. They are always so nice and remembered how I like my coffee after a year of not seeing me! Great customer service!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Nov 5, 2018~This location is so bad.  The young brunette girl at the drive thru window is just plain rude.  Will never go here again.  Thank you for that you horrible barista.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Sep 17, 2015~Not happy with my experience today. I left my drink in my car and asked for a refill, which the staff has always been more than happy to do for me especially since I'm there buying drinks every day. Today the barista was extremely rude and didn't just deny my request but made me feel like a fool for asking. I will not be remaining a loyal customer. Customer service should always be number 1.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~May 23, 2016~This is my favorite coffee place! Everyone is so nice and help you find what kind of coffee you want! I love it!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Mar 11, 2015~I'm surprised at all the bad reviews for this location. I've never had a poorly made drink here, the majority of the time they're made better than other starbucks. I personally love the sitting area since I'm at the tire shop across the street more often than I'd like to be.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Dec 19, 2012~Not a fast drive thru service but the staff is pretty friendly.  There's a guy there who works the drive thru window and he makes great conversation while you wait for your drink.  IThe only negative thing is that they only sell plain bagels. I wish they had multigrain!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~May 18, 2015~I am a more than frequent Starbucks drinker, and I've been to many Starbucks. However, I have never felt so annoyed with their staff. This was my first time at this location and I didn't like that it was outside only seating. We live in Arizona, and it's too hot for that! Also, I have been a Starbucks gold member for years! And for my other Starbucks lover out there, you know you get free refills of regular coffee and tea. Well, when I asked the barista about the refill, she she said that it wasn't an option. I thought maybe she was a newer employee, so I explained to her about how the refill works.. While I was talking, she just kept shaking her head no and saying no.. While I was still talking. On top of that, she ended charging my card for the full price of the drink instead of a refill. I will probably never go to this location again.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Nov 25, 2014~Okay so I worked at Starbucks for 7 years so I know how it should go and this one was not good. It's DT only which sucks as I was from out of town and wanted a second to see all they had (selection varies from market to market). We drove through and speed was okay but my drink was not. My shots were clearly bad and the milk wasn't steamed correctly. I brought it back to be re-made and they didn't really apologize or acknowledge the problem. At the time I was a partner so I was really surprised. I'd try Coffee Bean over this place any day.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jan 29, 2013~Over priced, coffee tastes burnt.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Dec 9, 2014~I love Starbucks however this location gets unhappy when confronted with a poorly made drink.  They spend a lot of time talking amongst each other and hate to be bothered by customers. Good thing there's a Starbucks in the Safeway around the corner which I've always had good experiences
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Dec 31, 2013~Been going here since the first day they opened. The staff is great but one in particular, Alexa McCall (or McCaw?) is an exceptional employee.  While waiting for my coffee I overheard a couple talking about her as well. They said she creates a very fun atmosphere. I'm amazed at how many customers who are driving up say hello by her name!  Wow!! Now if that doesn't prove excellent customer service I don't know what does. I agree with the couple this Starbucks has a great vibe. Oh, great  Latte's too!  Kudos to ya
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Feb 21, 2016~Natalie truly made my experience. I forgot to tell her I wanted my drink iced. When I told her, without a flinch she handed me the hot drink and started making me an iced one. She told me to put the hot one in the fridge and enjoy it later. I handed her my debit card and she said to not worry about it due to my extended wait, even though it was my own silly selfs fault... I'll always go back to this location, regardless of how far out of the way it is...
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Jul 12, 2012~Def not your standard Starbucks as far as layout.  There is no inside sitting area and Scottsdale is usually scorching hot in the summer.  There are misters outside and awesome shade that help with the heat.  It took longer to get a drink, but it was an ok experience.  It is just another Starbucks...nothing too special about this location.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Nov 19, 2015~This particular starbucks is THE ABSOLUTE SLOWEST one ever!!! Many times I am forced to stop at this one because it is closest to my house. There have been only 1 or 2 cars in front of me and they will still take up to 18 minutes to make a drink. I see them inside laughing, talking, leaning on counters while I see one person working. When they are busy, there are cars backed up into the street as this place does not have a store it is a drive up only. One would think that because it is drive up only without a store they would move faster. Nope....they don't and wont. I avoid this place as much as possible because of slow, slow, slow service. Currently been waiting for 14 minutes!!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Sep 10, 2014~AVOID THIS LOCATION!!!! And I'm not the first person to say this. Today was the third time I have received terrible service at this location. Usually they take a good 10 minutes to make my drink. Today it was only 2 min but the lady that took my order was rude and blunt. She never greeted me nor did she thank me. I thanked her for taking my order and she didn't even reply. And to top it all off my drink was only filled 2/3 of the way. Time to start going to a different location.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Feb 17, 2012~They are consistently busy, but apparently are not able to perfect their craft. Very, very slow. Whether it be four cars in line, or twelve, I always seem to be waiting at least 15 minutes or more for my coffee. One time it took SO long, they gave me my coffee for free... which is nice... but when I got to my destination I saw that both drinks I received were wrong.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 14, 2011~Always super busy but the crew at the drive thur always has a smile for me no mater what day or time it is.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Nov 12, 2011~Horrible service. Twice now I've gone there and they keep messing up my drink. I work for Starbucks!! It's not hard to get a drink right! Believe me. Horrible service. The people that work there All have bad attitude. One lady doesn't even look at you when your ordering your drink. I think that someone needs to go In there and fix it and make it a welcoming Starbucks that it's known for. Ya a few of the employees that work there are absolutely wonderful but when you get that one that is just rude it just makes you not want to go there anymore. I stopped going. They still get my drink wrong when my mom goes to get coffee. Horrible.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Feb 9, 2017~This Starbucks is literally good for NOTHING. They have no outlets outside, but tons of outdoor seating. I walked up to the order window and the barista just stared at me. She didn't say hello, she didn't ask me what I wanted to order. It was actually very awkward and uncomfortable. I definitely won't be going to this location ever again.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Feb 8, 2016~Was in the area and decided to stop in.  First time at this location and it will be my last.  Placed my order at the walk up window, then went to the rest room.  Came back to the window and waited an additional 12 minutes for my drink.  The actually had to ask me again what drink I had ordered.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Oct 9, 2015~Slowest Starbucks ever!  Took me over 15 minutes this morning to get my coffee and I'm late for work!!! Not going back
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jun 14, 2015~This place is awful! Consistently mess up orders. And even when it is brought to their attention they still don't make it right. I will never go back!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Nov 28, 2014~I was just at this starbucks  15 mins ago.... lemme say the crew is so cheerful and nice that  it made my day.  :)
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jan 25, 2024~on January 11th I went to this Starbucks location. I opened the door and the corner of the door scraped across the side of my shoe and ripped it. It was painful and ruined my new leather loafer.  My toe hurt like heck and luckily my toes was bruised and not torn open.  The store was so busy and no one could stop and talk to me. I got back to work and called the `"customer service `" number and reported it. after 2 calls and 2 emails I was told, they couldn't prove it happened....so sorry. basically get over it.  I sent them pictures of the whole thing. Their response.... Just have a great day.   I was not looking to rich, just fix the metal at the bottom of the door and compensate me for my $62 shoes.   I have been a loyal customer for 15 years. That changes tonight. SB did nothing but dispute the facts, the pictures and could care less about their customers.   Watch your toes if you walk into the South entrance of the 7th Ave store.... the bottom corner is not safe !
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Sep 5, 2024~Really nice group of Partners, it's a busy store but the team goes the extra mile to give good service.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Sep 25, 2023~Timing is everything here! But I will say I am def in love with the new ice this store has!!! The pellet ice is BOMMMMBBB!!!! Mobile orders are usually quicker than the timing says. That said - Friday mornings are a beast here!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 26, 2024~There is an employee that every time sadly I come to this store she gives me bad attitude. Last time she practically throw a drink at me thru the window the way she just handed it I understand that they are tired from a long day but there was no need for all of that I was being polite I even told her sorry about the long order that I had but every time she has a rude attitude at first she starts being nice and then you give your order and she is rude. Then today she handed the drinks and didn't place them correct in the drink carrier and just watched all my drinks fall. I have no bad intentions I hate even saying I have the wrong order but enough is enough.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Mar 25, 2024~The slowest Starbucks in town. Even if you aren't in a rush, you don't have time for this. I have come here over 10 times and every time my order is AT LEAST 10 minutes past the pick up time. It's usually 15-20 minutes behind my pick up time. I stopped going to this location for that reason. Roosevelt and 7th Ave is wayyy better.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Apr 3, 2024~Stupid slow starbucks  at their busiest time first thing in the morning They only have one employee waited 15 minutes
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jan 10, 2024~Walked in the other day with a soured attitude, compared to my usual: had an unfortunate morning. Whilst awaiting my coffee (ordered a little late) a barista noticed and asked what was up, supporting her suspicions with prior evidence of me being a more upbeat type. I really appreciate, despite sometimes not getting the correct order (and never really having time to seek vindication), being seen in this moment. Ya'll have a gem of an employee, I wish I remembered her name!I will say, generally clean/tidy, with self service products stocked `~70% of the time, and regardless of my frustration with a product on a given day: I've never felt conflict with the employees. Thank ya'll!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Nov 7, 2023~UNshaken..`"shaken`" espressos, drinks with alternative milk that I can taste weren't shaken before being used, excessive amounts of ice despite having a low ice modification (when applicable), iced drinks instead of hot ones, and on top of that hot grande cups instead of venti? Seriously is everyone working here blind? I've never had this many issues in so little time from any starbucks that ever became part of my routine. This is more than a store w a quirk, this is mental institution levels of unstable. What I would give to live next to a better starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Oct 30, 2023~All in all, this starbucks isn't worth the stop. They don't care enough to read the label, even when they're not busy.I keep ordering shaken espressos but I keep getting unshaken lattes. I keep ordering light ice but I keep getting drinks filled from top to bottom with ice.Not to mention how miserable it must be to be part of the `"team`" here; I'm constantly seeing individual team members forced to work backed up stations alone while their coworkers' `"have nothing to do`" but dink around at `"THEIR`" station.Nah, skip this ish.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Mar 20, 2024~HORRIBLE. I waited 30 minutes for an order of just a croissant that I placed 15 minutes ahead of time. When I tried to ask them about my order they ignored me.  I now will be late because they decided to prioritize the drive through line instead of people ordering 15 minutes ahead. I really hope they fix this up otherwise Dutch bros might be my new choice.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Sep 24, 2021~I go to this Starbucks every day and am amazed with the service I get! Drinks are always made correctly and I enjoy the seating to work.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Apr 15, 2023~This place is mind-boggling unprofessional. They're rude, inconsistent, unnecessarily confrontational, and argue with customers. Why has the service and quality at so many Starbucks gone down the drain over the last couple of years? They've become the Walmart of coffee experiences.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jun 3, 2023~AVOID THIS PLACE!!!Stopped in this morning around 7AM.  Ordered a tall Mocha.  Got handed a half cup of luke warm shi&amp;^t.  NEVER GOING BACK.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Nov 22, 2023~This is the slowest Starbucks in the valley. Mobile orders take 10+ minutes past the expected pick up time. The staff won't come to the counter to assist.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 11, 2023~Just watched the barista, Jasmine, wipe off tops of coffees she was preparing with her own apron. In her defense, they were so behind on mobile orders. I waited at least 20 mins. Not good for the AM! Also there was an unhoused man passed out at a table.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jun 29, 2018~This review is specifically for the drive-thru since that's been 100% of my experience and I've never been inside. This Starbucks location opened about half a year ish ago, and is on the way to work for me. I come here basically every week (yes, also guilty of going several times a week) and the drive-thru service has always been excellent. They move the line very quickly, especially during busy morning hours - this is KEY for those of us that need our morning coffee run.The corner that this Starbucks is located in is still under development, so at this point in time, there's still construction in the area.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Sep 23, 2023~Closed lobby at least 1 hour before closing. Locked doors and put signs blocking access to them. They rather close and leave early then do what they get paid to.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Sep 8, 2023~I politely asked them to turn the music down a bit and they all seem to be rude and ended up turned Disney music on &amp; turned it louder. It was such a kid show. I'd say this location was top of the list unwelcoming. I loved the music they had one before just a bit lower ._.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Nov 27, 2021~Terrible , rude customer service , no pastries and no apologetic attitude one so ever forThe fact the store is emptyAsked if they could give smallDiscount since they had nothing I originally ordered the front clerk dude just said no I said well can you maybe ask somebody . He rolled his eyes and said no . Name Noah . Sorry to bother you guys
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Feb 28, 2020~This location needs help Got my order wrong and had people waiting all over and it was 3 pm. I'll go elsewhere
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jan 3, 2021~My sister and I have been coming to this location since it opened and we've always had either a good or bad experience and today it was just horrible. I understand when we went it was super early, we got there 10 minutes after they opened but we expected better service. The lady taking our order seemed annoyed that we kept asking for things they didn't have, like I'm sorry we don't work here to know what you guys have and don't have. We were being corporative with the lady taking our order but at the end she messed up our order and it was just a pretty upsetting way to start the morning. We will have to reconsider coming here again, I think we'll take our business somewhere else with better service like the Human Bean.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Apr 27, 2023~This is the nicest starbucks that I've ever been to. The baristas are always so friendly and my drinks always taste so good.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jul 11, 2018~This is about fab customer service! Thank you Chase for making my Starbucks experience very positive. Why? Your friendly, your attitude and wanting to please. I came in for a nitro and it appears due to storms that hit your area your store was without power which impacted the ability to have Nitro.  You made alternate suggestions and were so sincere. I had a cold sweet creme brew and it was fab! Thanks again and I'll stop by again.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jan 17, 2022~Not sure what's going on with this location but It's never open, only drive thru and no app ordering. Because of this, the drive thru line is long AF and not even worth waiting. Who is sitting in a line for 30 minutes for coffee? As a result I either have to go to a different location or go to a local spot which I've been doing as of late. If you guys are short staffed then time to ramp up hiring. Pay more if that's what it takes because I won't be back until it's resolved.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Aug 19, 2018~This was so very cool.  The staff is all out on every customer.  They treat you like you're they're only one. The music was very nice.   Restaurant very clean.  I always Enjoy my visits to Starbucks.  Highly Recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jan 5, 2022~Update your hours on google to reflect your new closing time of 8pm  that way your employees don't look so scared when people try to come in thinking this location closes at 10:30pm
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Oct 4, 2021~Customer service is great here. Somtimes they might get your order incorrect but they will simply fix it next time you visit. The line seems long here but it actually goes by quickly. The staff all works together to get customers in and out of the drive thru and lobby. Keep up the great work guys.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jul 21, 2023~ordered a drink online was notifed it was ready I arrived and nothing was there, I asked the barista about it she said she would check and she just kept making other drinks... I waited an extra 15 minutes  and I had to ask another person in the front to check on it for me... last time I'll be coming here.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Sep 17, 2022~I typically like this location. I've been coming here since y'all opened. I had the rudest customer experience tonight. My friend and I stopped back for drinks. I got what I always get which is the paradise with a splash of black tea. The person taking the order seemed confused and had us waiting awhile. He finally got it on the scream and asked if we needed anything else and I said no. We waited probably 3-4 minutes until I asked if they needed anything else from me. They very rudely said they'd been waiting for them to answer about if we'd needed anything else. We'd already said no so they attitude seemed really unnecessary. We thought perhaps he was new but he was definitely not a new barista. When I got my drink it clearly didn't have the tea. It was milky white and when y'all add the tea it's more yellow. They continued to explain to us that coconut is white and that's why it was light. I'm truly not new to coconut milk OR the paradise so it was unnecessary. We started driving off and they very sarcastically told us to have a good day as though we'd been unkind to them. I'm sorry if they were having a bad day but taking it out on me isn't the answer.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Apr 4, 2021~The undankest of all Starbucks! If you're a cold brew fan look somewhere else these employees are too lazy to make any. Might as well be a McDonald's with how often they say their machine is down
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~May 5, 2021~The Navajo or Hispanic gentleman at the drive-thru window on 5/5/2021 at around 9:47 - 9:55 AM or so is loud, obnoxious and arrogant. Need to calm down too much annoying emery. They made a mistake on my drink and he was trying to teach me `"Next time, say no classic!`" TF Dude I wasn't born yesterday. I ordered a Grande ice coffee with cream no sugar. Notice, they made a mistake of not putting anything on the order sticker regarding sweetener on the cup.  That would at least mean no sweetener doofus. I tried to explain that was what I said and he sent me off.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Oct 25, 2019~The management at this location has some serious issues with properly stocking food items, every time I come it takes 4-5 orders before I hit a food item that isn't sold out. Now I'm not coming in at the end of the day, I typically come in around 8 am.The general mood of the employees reflects poor management. Doing the bare minimum out of duty. They are not rude or incompetent, they're just uninspired especially in comparison to the typical Starbucks.Average customer service and significant portions of your menu constantly out of stock... you're leaving money on the table... or sending it to another shop that understands inventory and demand.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Dec 21, 2019~The staff at this store is always so friendly. It is a real busy store so from time to time drinks do take a while but they always apologize and thank you for your patience. Very conveniently located and never had a problem with a drink (and I go here a lot). It makes a huge difference when you get what you ordered and it tastes great, add on the fact that they are good with customer service and you have a well run Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Apr 16, 2019~The drive thru often has a long line, but the service has always been better there than inside. Twice I have had some issues with my drinks, and both times they remade the drinks but not without expressing their frustration with me. I once ordered a specialty drink and only after 10 minutes was I told they didn't have the ingredients. I have also ordered a drink that was made with dairy milk when I ordered/paid for almond milk, and the barista remade it, but not without expressing her frustration that she had `"15 other drinks to make.`" I get that it's annoying to have extra work, but it's also not my fault. I always try to be very polite and understanding, and I know not every customer is like that. Fortunately, the drive thru is flawless.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jun 16, 2020~SWEETEST STAFF!!I just had a great experience at this Starbucks location. I did my mobile order and sent it to the Starbucks near my home, which is not close to my work and where I was at the moment. I submitted the order again to this location and called the other location to let them know that I won't be in there to pick up my order. I walked in and was greeted by so many happy faces :) Then Cierra helped me and walked with me through what happened. She is patient and kind and wanted to make sure she got it right. She asked for my name on my drink and called me `"lovey`" and that made my heart happy that there are good and kind people out there during this rocky time. I heard the team cheering Cierra when I walked out. The spirit of this store is amazing! So, THANK YOU, Cierra!!! You deserve a shout out from your manager! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Oct 11, 2019~Ordered two venti drinks, one with 2 espresso shots. They gave me one drink that is grande. I told the barista and he said, oh thats my fault since he asked how many shots I wanted and that 2 shots is normal for grande. What does that matter? If I want venti with 2 shots, don't change my order! He just looked at me and won't say anything.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 13, 2020~I live near by, used to get my coffee here because it's so close &amp; convenient ... until the disappointments continued to happen, they have young team members which is totally fine but I feel they might not being trained properly ? or they are not following the original Starbucks recipe... drinks are awful EVERY TIME, they never get it tight ...too sweet or lack of sugar, too strong or your coffee tastes like water! Honestly, I gave them way too many chances... now i rather drive to Osborn &amp; 7th street OR Osborn &amp; Missouri, they're friendly there, happy vibes, drinks are perfect!... Manager there too, doesn't give a crap about any critiques to improve their customer service &amp; quality seriously skip that location, you'll be disappointed!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Jan 28, 2021~In line at Starbucks at 9:40pm which is 20 minutes before closing. By the time I make it to the speaker the lady says `"we're closed and no longer taking orders because the system shuts down at 10:00pm`" But I just sat in this damn line for twenty minutes!!! I really needed a clean break up with Starbucks. I'm done and the crazy part is while I was sitting in the line waiting I had just uploaded money onto my Starbucks account. Most respectable companies come outside and block the drive through line after the last customer. Lazy bastards working tonight at the 7th Ave and Osborn location 01/28/21
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Nov 6, 2022~If you are ever in a mood for a delicious coffee, what's better than a freshly brewed coffee from Starbucks?Starbucks is one of the top ranked coffee shops due to their friendly and fast service.Starbucks offers great prices and a great atmosphere that makes you feel comfortable at all times.Starbucks provides free wifi for their customers.As soon as you walk into Starbucks the workers greet you and make you feel welcome.Starbucks workers are fast paced that you'll be in and out within minutes, enjoying your amazing coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Feb 27, 2019~Drove their and they didn't have ham and Swiss but Leah was really nice and upgrade for free.  Love this Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Sep 20, 2018~The Good; Drive through service is superb as is the pick up service. The  Bad; Getting into the parking lot from the suicide lane can be hazardous!!! Drive with caution and care.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Jul 13, 2021~Best Starbucks location in the area. Staff is so kind and accommodating. They have NEVER gotten my drink wrong, where I'll go to other places and be handed the worst thing I've ever tasted. Definitely recommend stopping here!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Oct 26, 2020~Very rude staff, and they made my coffee wrong. The coffee to cold foam ratio was none existent. They basically gave me a cold brew on ice.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Dec 17, 2020~If you are going to close, temp or otherwise, here's an idea, tell your customers beforehand so they don't waste time driving to your location.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 28, 2019~Had the worst experience this morning.  First they could not seem to understand my order.  Triple espresso apparently is now a late, news to me.  And then once that was sorted, the barista makes my drink over ice and has to remake and gets it wrong for the second time.  I drop the drink the trash as i left.  So disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~4~Apr 4, 2022~The coffee at this Starbucks is very good compared to others. The cashiers and window baristas are very friendly and nice to talk to when I go.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Aug 23, 2020~Always awesome service, fast, friendly, taking COVID seriously. Covfefe is always made right
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Jun 23, 2019~Costumer service could be better. I usually go through the drive thru and service is okay/good. Today I went inside and the guy literally no greeting didn't even say `"are you ready to order?`" he just stood in front of the register with a blank face, not welcoming at all. Glad he didn't make my drink, my drink was delicious though.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Mar 14, 2020~I just left the location at 3370 N 7th Ave in Phoenix, AZ. I had a mobile order to go (Receipt #796476). I attempted MULTIPLE times to ask for a flat lid as the entire group working the espresso machine and drive through window intentionally ignored me. Reluctantly it seemed, a young lady working the drive through window provided me a flat lid (it's lost on me why lid choice isn't an option on ordering ahead as often I might be getting coffee for someone else and don't want a sip lid). I proceeded to the condiment area to get a straw. Due to COVID-19 precautions it said I needed to go to the counter to get a straw. Again, MULTIPLE employees ignored me. I finally went to the register where the young lady was incredibly kind and assisted me with a smile. It took MORE energy for them to intentionally ignore me than to simply help me. I spoke to my spouse, who comes to this location EVERY SINGLE DAY, and they thought it was funny that I made that observation as they experienced the same customer service level earlier this morning. We spend a couple hundred dollars a month at Starbucks. I'm thinking it may be time we support small local coffee shops off this one incredibly off-putting experience. This was really unacceptable.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Dec 13, 2018~I visit this Starbucks location just about every morning! I have not been inside, as I just go to the drive-thru. AMAZING customer service. Each one working the window is absolutely pleasant! Truly, the best customer service in my opinion (and, to think that was done with). Today, I ordered my drink wrong and I was so mad at myself. The service gentleman was absolutely great and patient. All serving me with a smile. The speed and accuracy are great! TY Starbucks for instilling and training great works who exceed your customer service guidelines!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~2~Feb 1, 2020~Ima be honest. This Starbucks isn't bad it's just some of the people working there. You ever heard of the term Airhead? There's about 10 of them in this location. They don't know their own promotions the place is basically ran by teenagers or college kids who simply don't care. You ever ask someone a question that seems normal but that person you asked looks at you as if your speaking a completely different language? Those are the vibes in this place.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~May 17, 2019~Nice store.  Friendly baristas.   Great Starbucks.  In the parking lot next to a Sprouts and other businesses.  Open sitting area both inside the store and outside.   This store has a drive thru if you prefer or if you are in a hurry.  Truly, in the morning it might be faster to park and come inside to order than going through the drive thru.  That's just the nature of the beast.  They do get busy so keep that in mind.  Also, you can download the Starbucks app, set up your account and order from your phone with mobile order.  I do that at home and by the time I get here it's ready.  Just an FYI.  Btw, the Cold Brew is delicious here.  It's all I ever order and I've never had a bad one.  I come every day.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~May 13, 2021~I'm sick of coming to this location and having the baristas make up their own `"closing`" time. If you're supposed to be open till 10, you should be open till 10. They close anywhere from 9:00-9:30 every single time I attempt to come here. I worked for Starbucks for years. The system never `"shuts down`" automatically so idk why they told that other reviewer that. They are totally in control of when they close the register. They also always shut their mobile order off LONG BEFORE the designated time (should be 30 minutes before closing) but they shut it off at 9 or even earlier. Makes it harder for nurses like me who try to make coffee runs for their unit at night when they just block the drive thru off and ignore answering the phones, and they don't acknowledge you standing out front trying to read the hours posted to understand why they're closed an hour early. This location is buns. Go somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Jan 1, 2021~Went to Starbucks &amp; ordered a caramel Frappuccino &amp; when I received it it tasted like watered down milk!
Phoenix, AZ 85013~5~Oct 25, 2020~A few months ago, I would've agreed with some of the lower reviews, but this location has indeed improved! The staff is some of the friendliest I've ever encountered at a Starbucks. I haven't had a problem with any of my drinks in a while now, but when I have, they've been quick to fix them. Their drive-thru service has also gotten a lot faster.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Aug 24, 2019~Very very disappointed with the service we received today from Aride and the barista making our beverage. The facility was very empty.. waited 15 minutes for our Grande coffee and egg bites. Aride was not friendly at ALL... along with the barista with purple long hair. We will not be returning.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~1~Apr 28, 2019~This location has the worst cold brew, it's bitter and disgusting. Idk what the heck they are doing. Go someplace else that will give you a quality product.
Phoenix, AZ 85013~3~Nov 7, 2019~I have visited this Starbucks about once a week since they've opened, and they have gotten a lot better at efficiency and accuracy of orders, in both the drive through line and in store. Beware that they do run out of stuff a lot, and be especially wary of ordering food via mobile order. I mobile ordered a sandwich once that they were out of and my money was not refunded on the app, they just put out an empty bag that said `"out`" (I think the employee just didn't know the procedure for when food on a mobile order is out). I will say the staff is sometimes really great and friendly! If you can avoid visiting during the peak hours, you'll have a better experience.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 29, 2024~Good customer service food snd drink was out fast, tomato mozzarella was hot and good.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Mar 3, 2023~I've been to this location several times now since the Covid started and it's fully open with great indoor and outdoor seating. Staff is top ten in Phoenix shout out to Chase.My drinks here are always made correctly and in my hands always in under 5 minutes.Top ten Arizona SB location in my book.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Jan 19, 2022~I walked down here from another Starbucks looking to relax inside. The inside was closed and even the drive thru closed at 5pm. They would not let me use the toilet but a nice barista did get me a refill.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Apr 30, 2024~The Scottsdale and Mescal Starbucks location consistently provides exceptional customer service that is `"above and beyond`" any coffeehouse that I've visited.. And the outstanding consistency in beverage and food taste and quality has surpassed my expectations. My experience at the Scottsdale and Mescal location has increased the frequency of my visits to Starbucks. Not only do I frequently visit the Scottsdale and Mescal location, I am nearly a daily patron. I have also noted many other  frequent patrons.The Scottsdale and Mescal location has a warm and welcoming coffeehouse environment. Honestly, I feel as if I am sitting in my kitchen drinking home brewed coffee while eating breakfast. Why would I frequent the Scottsdale and Mescal Starbucks when I could enjoy breakfast in the comfort of my own home? It's the extraordinary customer service during each visit.I highly recommend the Starbucks  Scottsdale and Mescal location to anyone who would like to enjoy a wonderful coffeehouse experience. As a matter of fact, I have recommended this location to many people; friends, neighbors, and fellow volunteers, etc.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Mar 21, 2024~I go here a lot cause it's close to school but due to poor service quality I'll be looking for a different place. The people always take my order wrong, are unfriendly and take forever even if there are few people in the store.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Dec 14, 2022~I love this Starbucks.  It reminds me of the ones back home in Seattle.  They remember your name and most common drink order and they're quick.  I appreciate the service here most of all.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Dec 30, 2023~This is my favorite Starbucks around. I live closer to another Starbucks but come to this location. This store has great service (shout outs to Chase, ReiAnne, Brian, and others). Also the store is kept clean, and has adequate seating.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Feb 20, 2022~It's also about expectations, everyone is under staffed, so I always appreciate the service staff who are working.  Right now it's about the drive-through and it can be busy but it moves along pretty well it's a chain that has a variety of coffee drinks that you would expect to Starbucks. Everyday they have a dark roast which is what I usually get.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Oct 29, 2023~when your inside they don't care about you or anything and they care more about the drive thru. I shouldn't have to wait 30 minutes for a drink.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Dec 26, 2022~The people who work here are great at their jobs. Came in at 11:11 on 12/26 and had a nice interaction with the cashier and then got the nicest Irish Cream Cold Foam Cold Brew I've ever had. Great work by the barista!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Mar 5, 2020~This Starbucks makes the best Iced Matcha Green Tea Latte with Coconut milk. I've tried so many locations and they aren't as good as this one. I go out of my way to come here, the service is great, the drinks are perfect Definitely passed the vibe check
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Nov 7, 2021~I go to this Starbucks all the time and I order the same drink. It's about a consistent 50-60% of the time whoever is making drinks or takes my order gets it wrong. Today I had to send back the drive-thru guy 3 times. Finally, he says `"Here you go!`". So I paid and drove off. I was up the street, took a sip of my latte; low &amp; behold they forgot the vanilla... This is a common thing here at this place, and if I'm paying almost $6 for a drink, I should be able to trust the worker to get my drink right. ESPECIALLY AFTER REPEATING THE ORDER TO THEM MULTIPLE TIMES.Unfortunately, I was on my way to work and could not turn around for them to remake the drink. As a matter of fact, having to turn around for them to make my drink a 4th time shouldn't even have to happen in the first place.Definitely not coming to this location anymore due to it's inconsistency. Very dissatisfied and disappointed this keeps happening.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Feb 1, 2021~Sooooo the place is literally empty with two employees and one guy that had ran into the bathroom and then me!!! I Ran in to get a hot chocolate and had a bad experience with customer service. The Barista, Hannah, was so focused on the fact that my mask was starting to slip below my nose!  I couldn't see hot chocolate on the menu, which is because it's not listed, so i asked and she was just like, YEAH, we have hot chocolate! Im just like, oh well like what kind? And she just like annoyed, rattles them off like it was the biggest inconvenience of her life. I know it's hard times, im sorry my mask was slipping but employees need to be trained how to politely ask in a nicer way to for their mask to be readjusted. The hot chocolate is delicious though, hope the customer service can be as good next time too!!!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 6, 2020~This is my absolute favorite Starbucks location! The staff is so sweet and remember you. There are closer shops by my office but I like to leave home a little early just to come to this location.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~May 7, 2019~I am currently in the middle of finals for university, so I decided to get a late night coffee got there around 9:20 pm and it says it was open till 10So I figure there would be no issue well they were closed. I don't know if they closed early (because there was a delivery truck there) or what but if their daily hours say open till 10 pm, then that's when they should be open till. Plus the two ladies closing the store could have had the decency to say hey sorry we closed early for whatever reason, they both just stared at me.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Mar 6, 2020~This is the best Starbucks out of 56 in 2 mile radius. Drinks are consistent, service is fast,friendly staff and plenty of seats with plugs.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Oct 23, 2018~Newly opened Starbucks location on Scottsdale Road &amp; Mescal. It's very modern inside and out. The staff are friendly and made my drink correctly and quickly. They also have the nitro cold brew machine. Looking forward to going here more!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Feb 14, 2020~Beautiful new Starbucks. The barista Lexy is fabulous! Polite, low key, very helpful with beans to go. What a nice change from the Paradise Mall Starbucks by my house and that obnoxious Theresa! It's a longer drive but we'll worth it!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jun 26, 2021~This Starbucks is amazing. every time I've been here my drink and egg bites are made perfectly. Tricia (she's on drive thru frequently) is so friendly and always goes the extra mile. This location would get another star If Yelp allowed me to.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Dec 17, 2018~Nice location. Lack of comfortable chairs makes this Starbucks less than desirable. A few leather chairs (instead of the hardwood chairs they currently have) would make this place much better.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Jan 14, 2019~Worst Starbucks drive through I've ever been in! It wraps around the whole building so I couldn't see what was happening ahead when I sat at the order window for over 5 minutes and heard from no one! I assumed they were closed though it was the middle is the day... I drove around to find multiple cars in line ahead of me. I sat in the drive through for almost 15 minutes and left with no drinks...
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Feb 21, 2020~Purchased some coffee for me and my staff yesterday. Unfortunately the order was Incorrect. When I called, Andrew (I believe that was his name) had told me that he could replace the drinks if I just head over. Luckily I work almost right next door, so I head over got my correct drinks. Plus on top of that a few free drink cards. That's how customer service should be, going above &amp; beyond without being asked to. Great job guys!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Feb 2, 2019~I like this location and go a lot to get work done, but tonight they closed the bathrooms for `"temporary cleaning`" around 7:30 pm. At 9 pm-an hour before closing- I went to the bathrooms and saw they were still closed. I asked the barista's if they were done cleaning since it had been an hour and a half. They said no. I'm hoping it's not a regular occurrence for employees to close the bathroom two and a half hours before store closing time.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~Oct 19, 2019~Got the bacon and Gouda breakfast sandwich.  The bread was warm/hot. The bacon was minimal but kind of warm.  The cheese was kind of warm.  The eggs were cold and kind of wet.  Ick. Am guessing they arrive to the stores frozen and they didn't cook it long enough.  No napkin in the bag nor offered to me (fortunately I noticed before I took off so asked for one).  Their drive through credit card machine must have been broken so the poor guy working there had to go somewhere else to run my card, which took a while.  The drive thru was horribly backed up and slow, guessing this was at least partly why.  They recently opened so perhaps they're just working out kinks.  Oh, and the layout of the drive thru and parking lot is very awkward; I almost got hit trying to get to the drive thru from Mescal by a gal pulling in from Scottsdale (it is a very abrupt turn into the parking lot/drive thru entrance from Scottsdale and so you probably have to basically slam on your breaks once you turn in).
Cave Creek, AZ 85331~5~Dec 12, 2024~Allysa is the definition of amazing customer service! Not only did she help me with ny drink customization. She automatically cut the croissant in half for my children. It's something I never wound have thought to ask for at Starbucks, she is just a pro! I've never come in to such an illuminating atmosphere and she definitely brightens up the place! Starbucks is such a quick stop for me, I'm usually in and out. But Allysa really made my time here memorable and she deserves recognition!
Cave Creek, AZ 85331~5~Nov 16, 2024~This Starbucks has to be the best one in Arizona, the  Manager , Matt, and his assistant manager Tyler are absolutely the best.  Great service, always friendly and make it feel like you're drinking coffee at home. I would definitely recommend the Starbucks for your coffee. Enjoy and cheers.
Cave Creek, AZ 85331~5~Aug 31, 2023~This will always be my go-to Starbucks. I always have great experience and the workers treat me amazing every time. As I am a frequent customer, I appreciate that they take the time to learn my name and sometimes start a conversation with me. If you're bothered with having to wait for a drink, simply stay home and make it yourself. Starbucks is a very busy business and it's expected with the amazing products they serve.  I don't mind having to wait 5-15 min for my drink because they always make sure my order is correct and delicious. Starbucks will always be #1.
Cave Creek, AZ 85331~5~Aug 30, 2023~Fastest Starbucks ever! I pass by plenty on my way to work but I always choose this one because the service is fast, correct orders, and friendly employees! Its in a convenient location with ample seating inside, great place to meet up. I always get a yummy vanilla latte and sometimes a sandwich for breakfast. Thank you!
Cave Creek, AZ 85331~5~Nov 29, 2020~The BEST Starbucks around. Always fast and friendly. When the drive thru gets busy it's a pretty bad setup with cars coming from all different directions, but it's not their fault, the layout of this building and it's parking lot has always been bad.
Cave Creek, AZ 85331~1~Nov 14, 2021~They are lazy and if you go inside plan on being there until the drive thru clears completely. Today took 14 minutes for 2 hot lattes and a frappacino Then watched the girl pour milk she had in a cup back into the gallon while spilled the rest of it all over. The frap was also made wrong the caramel and the whip were at the bottom instead of the middle in a caramel ribbon crunch. Lazy and still took forever. I can't believe how mismanaged this location is. I was happy we got one closer to the house but looks like We are switching back to desert ridge.
Cave Creek, AZ 85331~5~Mar 11, 2022~I absolutely love this starbucks! all the employees are so attentive and sweet, and my drinks always come out perfect! my personal favorite employee is Larry, he's very professional and very friendly! 10/10 for this establishment
Cave Creek, AZ 85331~5~Apr 13, 2022~Kevin is the best manager always working!  The employees on Tuesday always are smiling happy and greet you.  I always get my drink made perfect!  Super organized clean and always enjoyable when I sit and have my coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Oct 30, 2024~If you're driving thru - you get what u expect from Starbucks!However, in store -  I've had two dissatisfying customer service experiences ( back to back ) within the past week. Although we were greeted by a smiling gentleman today, no one else in the store bothered to look up and acknowledge the consistent flow of customers walking in. Then once a woman did take our order, there was such a cold attitude and absence of friendliness. Now, I've worked in customer service just about my whole life, so I understand operating quickly when you are busy with customers. However, I also understand the importance of generating a positive experience for the customer in the process, and the impact it can make when there is a lack thereof.While waiting for my order to come out, I couldn't help, but notice the barista that took my order, along with another one, (the same woman who took my order during my last visit) have the same robotic RBF with every single customer exchange. She was wearing a loud, colorful outfit with dangly pumpkin earrings. You would think her vibe would match her outfit. This woman in particular I want to point out, not to personally bash her, but to hopefully grab their attention so they can make positive changes. To shorten this up - during our last visit - after ordering and sitting with our coffees, I walked back up to get a water for my 2 year old daughter and had to wait a total of 7 minutes for a simple water cup, while watching other people come and go. And during today's visit, my order came out incorrect, but I didn't even want to ask for them to fix it because of the serious mean-mugging eye contact and lengthy wait-times.Such negative energy in this store. I hope we can be more positive people tomorrow.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jan 5, 2024~1st they place the drive through speaker on a busy cross street 2nd one person starts the order then another takes over saying sorry I didn't get that so I'm basically shouting the order and her response is condescending and you can hear laughter in her voice calling me friend so you can just tell that they are doing this on purpose and laughing about it and frankly I know that my beverage will be undrinkable I refrain from being unpleasant because who needs that energy fortunately someone else hands me my beverage so basically it's clear the females are just out to screw with customers
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Dec 27, 2021~I'm sorry but if you're making the coffee then you should NOT be handling drive thru how many times do I have to basically yell my order because 1 the noise of the traffic and then 2 you're trying to hear me over the expresso machine and then act like I was being difficult because I kept having to reorder until I was basically yelling!?  She wasn't alone the woman at the window was clearly not taking the orders and YOUR Unpleasant unprofessional body made sure to look to me and say `"have a nice day `" like I think you meant it not !  And furthermore I'm now going to pour my order out because I don't trust that you didn't tamper with it!!  I will NEVER go here again I regret not going to a local place rather than this corporate cookie cutter location
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jan 7, 2020~People are nice it's close to my work but man there is no sense of urgency. People the drive through should be efficient not an ordeal. I waited at least 5 minutes before leaving as the line did not move an inch! It was backed up! This is a common occurrence and in the land of Starbucks should be unacceptable. I also think they are at a too hot temp because the coffee tastes a bit `"burnt`" and it's a bit hot so can't drink right away. This location should go through a revamp/retraining because whomever is managing is doing a poor job!This location ran out of hot cups really?! Who does the ordering they should be fired! Your business is Coffee for god sake you need to have to have your ordering down if you know you're going to run out go to food depot and buy generic until your shipment comes in so you aren't turning away customers. this is absolutely pathethic. Shame on you Starbucks! Around the Holidays as well...out of holiday flavors..and hot cups!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jan 24, 2017~People are nice it's close to my work but man there is no sense of urgency. People the drive through should be efficient not an ordeal. I waited at least 5 minutes before leaving as the line did not move an inch! It was backed up! This is a common occurrence and in the land of Starbucks should be unacceptable. I also think they bre at a too hot temp because the coffee tastes a bit `"burnt`" and it's a bit hot so can't drink right away. This location should go through a revamp/retraining because whom ever is managing is doing a poor job!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jan 25, 2024~If I could do half a star, I would. Their front door has a jagged edge and it is sharp. It caught my sister's foot and cut through her shoe and cut her foot. Corporate offices said too bad. So sad. Well I don't think that's good enough. So, take heed to your feet when you walk into that particular location because you might lose a toe.   It is sad that a corporate office is showing Epic disregard FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,,,,All she wants is her shoes replaced. $62.  so everything I've said here happened and is true. I'm not saying anything ill of the company just the fact that you need to take care of your customers in every way shape and form.   HAVE A NICE DAY.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Feb 21, 2023~So this is in a little center next to Taco Guild, so parking is super easy. Never would. I think I would be giving a Starbucks a two star review however, I ordered the pink dragon drink and ordered it with less ice... This is my standard order and the cup was not filled to the top. It was filled 3/4 of the way. It also took a very long time to get after I ordered it. I get this drink everywhere I go and never have I had that issue before so between the time it took to get the drink and the fact that it was not filled to the top, I was not happy. The only reason that I am rating it 2 is the girl who took my order was really kind.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Mar 14, 2023~The drive thru is a mess but the brewed hot coffee is pretty consistently good at this location (blonde and Pike roasts). Service is decent, they are doing their best at a busy store and have the most baristas they can possibly squeeze in the small space behind the counter. The building and cacti in front are cool too, classic central Phoenix.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Mar 30, 2024~This is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to.... I have lived down the street from this location for two years now and every single time I give it another chance I end up regretting it... the employees mess up my drink, every single time and it either ends up tasting extremely burnt or like straight milk.. I am a fellow barista so I know how things work and employees at this location don't care about their job or they are not properly trained. This is the closest Starbucks to my home, and I intentionally drive further to a different location every single day because their service/product quality is HORRIBLE! I am never one to hate on a business and I rarely write reviews.. however I am extremely disappointed with this Starbucks and want to warn others to stay away.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Oct 25, 2021~Update:It's been a couple of years since I've been in this location, but it was like meeting an old friend... great batista, super sweet.   Coffee was excellent and we both enjoyed our visit.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Apr 24, 2018~Went inside to avoid the long drive thru line, great idea  zero line inside and my order was ready in minutes.  Tried the chicken sausage and bacon biscuit door the first time, was really good.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Jul 14, 2021~I walked in here after getting off the bus(right on the 7th st. bus line)and liked the retro 60s look of the building. They were very busy but I had my coffee and large ice water in minutes. Staff was excellent. Negatives are the below avg. sized seating area and having to ask to be let in the toilet rooms.The drive thru was very busy but that did not detract from my in store service.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Mar 13, 2024~This location used to be amazing. Used to have lots of seating and room for small meetings. They recently changed the interior and now only have 5 small tables. Lots of wasted floor space in the middle of the room though, in case that's important to you. Definitely not designed to keep customers in the store and spending money. Still good for the standard coffee grab-n-go.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Aug 25, 2023~Did a mobile order and waited 30 minutes to find out they don't put out mobile orders where the mobile pick up signs are? Now my food is cold and wasted 30 minutes of my life. Will be going to a different location next time where they actually have a good system.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Dec 14, 2023~This is a great location if your using the drive thru line ONLY, even then they mess up or forget things often. I had a terrible expirence when going inside to order when a group of friends had walked there 3 hours before closing and their door were locked. They wouldn't let us order until one of us eventually ordered online and had to go into the drive thru line with ZERO cars in it and ask for our mobile order. They originally told us to get out of the drive thru line, before eventually handing the drinks out the door while they were still inside. Not even letting one of the gals use the restroom because the inside was `"closed for the night`" again 3 HOURS before closing. BY FAR the worst starbucks expirence.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Nov 28, 2023~Waited for 10 minutes until someone came up to the register to take my order. Even after making  eye contact with an employee no one came to assist me until 4 other people were behind me . Very disappointed considering I almost couldn't order because I had places to be.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Sep 29, 2022~By far the worst Starbucks experience I've had. AND I am a prior barista at Starbucks, for 5 years. I know how things should be, and I received piss poor service today at this location. Firstly, I 100% know how to order my beverages and know what I want, again because (prior barista). I asked for 3 iced drinks, in which I had to repeat multiple times to order then I requested a pound of espresso beans ground for espresso which I also had to repeat a couple of times also. Upon pulling up to the window, I was handed my drinks to include a hot beverage in which I ordered iced in the first place. Then I was handed a bag of BLONDE espresso, I at no point ever once asked for blonde espresso because I can't stand it, so disgusting. The barista (taking orders, not the one at the window) gave me an attitude about the fact I didn't want the blonde espresso, then scoffed off, upon retrieval of my new bag of espresso, the same barista made sure to speak over the barista at the window saying `"is that the one you want`" with an attitude. As if I didn't know what I wanted, when in fact I ordered regular espresso from the get  go. Upon driving away the bag of espresso started pouring all over me, mind you I am in the middle of a work day. They did not properly  close the bag of espresso, it was VERY sloppily, crumpled together. Now if they were a decent barista, the bag needs to be tapped against the counter a few times to get all grounds down into the bag, then the air needs to be pushed all the way out and then the sides of the bag to be folded all the way down and then sealed with the ties. MANAGER//SHIFT SUPERVISORS and BARISTA TRAINERS at this location TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE HOW TO PROPERLY GRIND AND SEAL A POUND OF COFFEE. This is so sloppy, and so unprofessional.I PERSONALLY CLOSED AND SEALED THE BAG ONCE HOME, HOW IT SHOULD OF BEEN HANDED TO ME AT THE STORE AND EVEN SO IN A PAPER HANDLEBAG!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Apr 23, 2022~Totally messed up my order. When drive thru, no time to check coffee/food because we are nice and don't want to block traffic. I ordered a venti size of mango dragonfruit refresher, all I got was a large cup of sugar water, for $7, see pictures. When I got my drink I knew it's wrong but the lady handed me said: it turns out to be nice color! And I checked the sticker on the side, it says my name and order with the customizations. So I don't know how ppl work there do their job. Basically you place an order, and get a whatever?
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jan 2, 2020~This is my second time at this Starbucks and for some reason they do not call out your name when your order is ready. The staff just seems to talk to each other instead of paying attention to the customers. They also made my beverage wrong not sure if they even pay attention to the ticket order.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Aug 13, 2021~Ordered drinks.  Guy gave me a tall size in a Venti.  I paid for a venti and he said `"that's what you get`".  I was like, it's not a venti and was told he could add more cream to make it a venti.  Never again.  Thanks.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jan 22, 2022~Mobile order being turned off is a huge disappointment. The location should revisit the drive through set up, it should be backwards from how it's designed. Traffic backs up into Osborn constantly, isn't that the same reason Dutch on central and camelback was forced to close? I truly miss the days of being able to walk here and mobile order ahead of time.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~May 8, 2015~If you're in the drive thru lane, please be courteous to the patrons who have parked and walked in to the store. When they are attempting to back up, please do not move your vehicle directly behind them blocking their attempt at exiting the establishment. Its really common courtesy, to not block someone in when you can blatantly see they're trying to leave.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Feb 5, 2022~By far, Starbuck's has the BEST Cold Brew! Dunkin' Dnuts cold brew always has a funny chemical taste to it.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Mar 9, 2020~I waited to long to write this review but this is MY FAVORITE STARBUCKS. Whenever i order from here the drink taste good not like other places where it's not sweet. I always love the drinks I purchase from here. Not only that but once time i was in line and the manager Helen and a cute young man in the drive through covered my drink because i forgot my wallet at home! It was so thoughtful and sweet. Genuinely that made my whole week!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Nov 26, 2022~Got my mocha! It was perfect! I also appreciated the fast service and the fact that everyone had masks!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Aug 23, 2022~Very Rude worker very disrespectful toward ppl of color when asked to speak to a manger the worker said she didn't know when she would be in when clearly everyone is on the work schedule they messed up my order then I had to wait a longtime to get the order rite I'm just standing there and the workers were just looking on while I waited by far worst Starbucks ever.there reviews say it all
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Feb 25, 2017~It's a bummer to see so many have had bad experiences. This is the closest drive-thru Starbucks to me so naturally I've been here more times than I can count. Some days it is slower than others but overall I find them comparable to any other location. Today (a Saturday), I went around 10:30am &amp; there was no wait at all. There was one car already at the window when I drove up but they were gone in a few seconds &amp; the barista already had my drink in hand! My drinks are a mouthful to order, &amp; they've pretty much always gotten them right. I love the Smoked Butterscotch Latte which I get iced, decaf with soy. Try it while you can!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Apr 19, 2014~It's nice to see more Starbucks popping up in this historic hood. This particular Starbucks looks like its occupying a converted retro mini drive-thru bank.  Glad to see lots of restoration going on and more businesses like Starbucks coming in.Tall Misto was made fresh, quick and yummy but barista seemed confused since I didn't leave a tip. Sorry me no tippy at windows.  I use to work a drive-thru in high school running around a grease pit flipping burgers and dropping fried tacos while taking orders and making change-all with a smile.  I got a paycheck-and even when I served cocktails at the Phoenician I still had some old cheapskate buzzards who wouldn't tip when I served up a $100 bottle of champagne while carrying heavy silver and crystal all while in sky-high-heels. A tip for handing me packets of sugar and swiping a credit card? Sorry no can-do.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Dec 29, 2016~I have been to this Starbucks location a few times and have had nothing but good experiences.  Drinks have all be made as I ordered them (and my drink orders can get complicated).  Service has been as expected (`"Hi, how are you?`"  `"What can I get started for you?`"  `"Thank you, it will be right up`").Like any busy coffeeshop, the wait at this Starbucks can be longer at times... however, if you don't like that, then as they say... there's an app for that!If you don't like to wait, then place your order on your mobile app and go pick up your drink.  No need to talk to anyone who might be super busy making dozens of drinks... or sit and wait for your drink (and/or food) order... or otherwise take issue with a busy location.  I mean, yeah, sure, you could complain about the parking situation (the long drive-thru line can block the ability of people to pull out of their parking spaces), but is that really Starbucks' fault.  If you build it, then they will come.  And if you build a Starbucks, then a lot (and I mean A LOT) of people will come.  So get in the right mindset and you'll be able to enjoy that drink instead of getting all hot and bothered (in a bad way). ****FOUR STARS****
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Apr 18, 2020~This location is in a convenient intersection near 7th ave and Osborn and close to the freeway. It's easy to access on the way to work. There is usually a line of 3 to 4 cars minimum but they move the line through fairly quickly. I haven't had any issues with orders at this location and each staff member I have interacted with has been professional and friendly. My food orders are hot and fresh and my drink orders I can expect the same great taste each time I order.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Jun 12, 2017~I'm not sure why this location has such a low rating. I swing in here on Sunday mornings and pick up my mobile order. My order is always ready and waiting when I get there and one of the staff greets me as I pick my coffee up from the bar.The inside is updated the same way all Starbucks are and is clean and airy. They have good seating inside and a large patio area. The drive through lane is smaller and awkwardly placed so I can see how that might be problematic on weekday mornings.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Apr 25, 2021~I love the black tea guava lemonade it's so refreshing and tropical! This location has always been fast and friendly! Keep up the good work!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Oct 13, 2017~Three of us stood in line for 5 minutes or more being completely ignored by the three employees working.  I couldn't believe how blatantly these employees were trying to ignore us.  I get that your busy but that was ridiculous.We walked out without buying anything and without being spoken too.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Nov 15, 2018~Great service! I go to different Starbucks all the time. Its my home away from home and work away from work . Fast service and very cozy.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Aug 1, 2017~I would say the only downside of this Starbucks is the drive thru. It's literally right off of Osborn so if there is a bit of a line, you can't go in without hanging out on the street. Other than that, this Starbucks had a really cool modern look on the outside and the service and drinks have always been great. I usually do mobile orders here and they're always ready right when I walk in.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Nov 19, 2019~I really don't understand what is complicated about making a green tea lemonade with classic syrup. The last few times I have been to this Starbucks, after not only having to wait in a slow drive thru, my order is never correct. If you're going to charge people close to $5 for a drink, the LEAST you could do is make it properly.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Sep 27, 2019~Really beautiful space, unfortunately would not recommend.  The bathrooms are locked with a code and staff will not give you the code. I find this extremely uncomfortable and frustrating because when I am here studying and DRINKING TEA for hours I need to use the restroom frequently. The staff also seemed to be having some issues between them. The manager had to come out to the table next to me and ask a barista to get back to the bar. Super awkward, distracting, and uncomfortable .
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Mar 8, 2017~After the 3rd day in a row of my drink being made wrong, I feel it's only necessary to write a review. Normally, I'm pretty understandable. I get it, sometimes during high volume times, it's inevitable something may go wrong, a drink made wrong, ect. So first time (Monday) this happened I thought `"okay, not a big deal, it happens`". In  addition, on Monday, my drink came out to be more than it normally is. I made a comment to the girl at the window asking if they raised their prices since my drink has costs the same for the past year. She said she didn't know but that's probably why it was. Then when it was made wrong on yesterday (Tuesday) I was a bit more annoyed BUT still gave it the benefit of the doubt. Then, today when I received my drink, it was again made wrong for the THIRD day in a row. Now I don't get a super fancy drink. Every time I get a Grande Triple Shot Expresso on ice with 2 pumps vanilla and almond milk. That's it! I don't ask for 1 pump vanilla, 2 pumps mocha with a  splash of cinnamon or anything crazy like that. Monday it was made with pumps of white chocolate mocha, yesterday they forgot the almond milk all together and today it was made with 3 pumps vanilla. Most wouldn't have an issue with this but I have perfected my drink of choice over the years and when its 6am and I need this to function in life (quite literally), its a bummer when it doesn't taste the way you want it to. Next question you are probably wondering if I went back and had them remake it. The answer is no for 2 reasons. One- I am not going to be that person who go back and asks them to remake a drink during the busiest time of the day. They are already rushing to try and trying to get other peoples orders out so I deal with it. Second, I have no time. By the time I get my order I'm usually already cutting it close to getting to work on time. Having to wait to have them remake my drink isn't going to happen. On a positive note- the staff I have encountered here are all very nice and friendly. And although the drive through line does get a bit long and takes a while, its only to be expected with it being downtown off a busy street. One tip I would highly suggest to this Starbucks is to fix your monitor in the drive through. This way if my order is put in incorrectly I can advise them right then  and there to fix it. Oh, and they never repeat your order to you either so if its wrong you wont know till later.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Oct 10, 2019~Well I guess this is what happens when I cheat on my normal Starbucks! Where do I begin? Walking in right away I noticed this location was pretty dirty. I understand I have one of those `"complex`" drinks so I always make sure I don't spout it all quick, I order clear and slow so there isn't confusion. Even doing this the barista taking my order stopped after the first line and said `"I'm sorry what?`" So we started over. No biggie. I get my very messy and sticky cup of my cold brew w/cold foam. I notice it has a regular and not strawless lid. (Which is typically put on these types of drinks so you can enjoy the foam) I was informed `"sorry were out of those lids`". Fine, cool I'll just drink it with out the lid. Well that proves problematic since all the foam sticks to the regular lid when you take it off. As for the drink itself I asked for blonde espresso and got regular, asked for hazelnut syrup and got toffee nut. Lesson for today Cheating is Bad. I hope my regular Baristas forgive me.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Sep 23, 2013~This is a brand new location for Starbucks and it's mostly a drive through venue. There is a pint-sized area inside (4-5 tables) and a larger outdoor patio if you wish to relax with your beverage and pirate some wifi.Employees here were prompt and pleasant. Overall, a fairly typical Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Sep 4, 2019~Great service and great coffee. Nice environment to work in and their outdoor landscape is beautiful! I got the cold brew and it was delicious as always. All employees were super polite and helpful!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jul 21, 2018~WORST STARBUCKS EVERRRR. I have never been able to get in and out of this place in a reasonable amount of time. Even with mobile ordering, even with there not being a lot of customers, even with there being more than enough baristas on staff, expect a long wait. Another unique feature of this location is that you get a side of attitude with your order. I placed a mobile order for a hot latte and they made it iced, and instead of offering to remake it when I pointed it out, I received an eye roll from the barista. Just skip this location and go to another, even if it takes an extra few minutes drive, it's worth it and you'll still end up saving time.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Feb 15, 2020~Dutch Brothers (on Central and Camelback) where have you gone??I'm left with driving to 3 different Starbucks locations to find one @ 8pm that's open. Please Starbucks, change your hour's on your Websites! This was the lucky one. One car ahead of me, got my drink pretty quick, lady was nice at the window, but I gave her a $20 for a $5 drink and got $4 and some change back. I guess it was a $15 and some change Latte????No thanks .... I'll drive a hundred extra miles next time to get to Dutch Bros!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Oct 25, 2016~Terrible! I'm only giving 2 stars bc they were nice and seemed to have fun... but not at the expense of me! They were well staffed but the line took 13 mins! Annnnd my drink has no whip but they left plenty of room for it!! And of course I'm on my way to work and didn't have time to stop and have them fix it! Ugh! Love Starbucks but there aren't any decent locations in central Phoenix
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Dec 8, 2013~A hangout place for central Lyft drivers. I get my caffeine fix here when I'm driving. Get a Starbucks mobile app and pay your drinks with your phone. I've never experienced the drive through, but from my observation. The employees inside are hard working! They are very busy. Some people just like to give negative reviews because of lack of patience I guess. I'm not a fan of their coffee, but I do enjoy their grilled artisan  vegetarian breakfast sandwiches. Unfortunately they do not carry organic Stevia! Unlike other coffee houses, this one serves that pink poison `"Aspartame`".
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Apr 20, 2017~This is the slowest starbucks I have ever been too. There were 2 people in front of me that order pretty simple drinks. I just ordered an iced tea. They keep the tea in a pitcher next to the sink. It was already made. Pour that stuff over some ice and throw it at me. I really don't understand it. I think it's a Starbucks policy to make drinks in order but come on? Really? It's already made you just have to pour it. Can't the person standing in the corner not doing anything pour it real quick?? Other than that:Quality: 10/10 Wifi: 10/10 Customer service: 11/10 Speed: turtle emoji/10
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Mar 6, 2016~I just left the drive thru of this Starbucks. First time going and the last. The guy working the window had no personality and when I said have a great evening he just shut the window on me! Such BS!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Dec 29, 2015~I don't usually write reviews for chains but this Starbucks is bad. The drive thru is remarkably inefficient, and I once literally waited 30+ minutes for the 3 cars in front of me. They're just so slow and that's not the point of a drive thru!They also run out of things. I'm not taking a cookie or cupcake. They'll be out of syrups for standard drinks (on a regular basis).There's other Starbucks locations I would rather go to. Visit at your own risk!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Feb 17, 2017~This place deserves the two-star ratings..Had an iced and a dark coffee. Both had no taste, not even the `"burnt`" taste, they were more like water.My iced was like 95% ice cubes btw.When asking for a refill of hot dark coffee the barista gave me another iced. Then 2nd time she gave me a pike. 3rd time's a charm though I guess..I could forgive all this if the internet wasn't so slow.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Jul 11, 2018~These stars are for Lissa, she fixed my own screw up. I forgot to put in my mobile order and she jumped on it like it was her fault. She's the best.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Dec 30, 2018~Every time I come to this Starbucks it's a super long wait. I feel as if they need to send corporate in there to shape up the crew, they have 8 employees on the floors any given time but they're very inefficient, staff is very friendly and the store is always clean but it doesn't matter if it's Monday afternoon or Saturday morning it's a minimum of 15 minute wait for what looks like maybe 4 cars in the drive thru and about 7 customers inside. The manager here needs to be re-evaluated.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Aug 3, 2015~Worst drive thru ever. If you're in a time crunch, do not stop here. Their workers are slow and not friendly. I think they hire mostly high school kids.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Jan 2, 2014~My coffee spot. Everyone's super nice and I love my dirty chais. The drive thru is pretty quick as well. Sometimes I just like to go in and sit and wait for my coffee. Relaxing and I dig the inside layout. Yay!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jul 26, 2018~Not surprised by the average two stars for this location. The barista was rude. I asked about happy hour and she said it was with an attitude. Placed my order and was charged for both drinks. Very disappointed. Really sad considering Starbucks is supposed to have good service. I should also add that the carm mach they made was sub par.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Dec 30, 2018~We walk to this Starbucks every Sunday with the dog.  Recently they started making the pup cups in the very small cups.  We asked for a larger one and were rudely told no.  The last few times the employees did accommodate but did give an attitude about it.  One of our drinks is supposed to come with whip cream but my husband doesn't want it.  Probably should ask for it in a side cup.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Nov 11, 2018~Everytime I come  this Location my order is wrong ! Why is so hard for the staff to get things correct . Who is it so hard for them to communicate after you order and pay and they give you the order -- that they are out of something. They mix up orders on serval occasions definitely can't go thru the drive thru and not double check the order cause you get home and it's wrong . Or pay a diff price twice in a week for the same thing. I didn't come here for a while even tho. It's so close to my house and again 3 times in the last week wrong orders .. Einstein your looking good .. always a terrible experience at this one location .
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~May 7, 2016~I've been to this location a few times and haven't ever had a bad experience, beverage- or service-wise. One of my go to Starbucks drinks is the green tea Frappuccino; I've gotten it a few times here and it's been great and the staff has been friendly.However my big caveat would be that usually I go through the drive-thru in the afternoon, when there isn't much of a wait. I wouldn't even think about trying to go to this location during the morning rush, though, since the store and parking lot are tiny. If you're in need of some coffee during a weekday morning, I'd recommend the larger Central Ave (Park Central complex) location, which has plenty of parking.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Oct 4, 2015~I've learned with this Starbucks that it's all in the timing.  Coming here in the morning is an absolute madhouse.  Last Friday morning around 7:45am I saw the drive through line wrapping around the entire parking lot, so I walked in to order to try to save time.  It was standing room only and total chaos!  It took almost 20 minutes to get my coffee, but the staff was clearly working their butts off to get everything done as quickly as possible - it was just so crowded!However, in the afternoons or on other non-busy hours, this Starbucks location is great.  The drive through is convenient and, while never particularly fast, can usually be pretty efficient.  Walking in, there are usually seats available.  All in all, I would recommend avoiding it during rush hour because they are so high volume and it can get crazy, but any other time it's a great location!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Sep 13, 2017~I've worked just around the corner from this location for years. I frequent a number of Starbucks locations in town along with some other coffee shops, but this location's customer service and employee work ethic is so bad, I have decided l will no longer purchase anything here if I have ANY other options.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Nov 19, 2013~I really like the layout of this new Starbucks and the building is pretty cool too.  Normally the services at Starbucks are pretty great.  But this time around we did not have a really good experience.  The guys that check us out were nice and friendly.  When we were waiting to pick up our coffee, we waited more than 10 minutes and we only had a couple of people ahead of us.  Also they make my mom's coffee wrong.  Since I really like Starbucks I will give this store another shot.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Aug 25, 2017~This is the most poorly run Starbucks I have ever been to. As a loyal Customer for 15 years - the experience, wait time and entire energy in the store is terrible. I have consistently waited 25 min for 1 coffee and the poor employees are deflated by the chaos. The leadership at this Starbucks needs an overhaul.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Aug 14, 2019~Had to go through the drive-thru twice to get the drink I ordered correct and they left chocolate just sitting at the bottom of the remake so I had to stir it so it would not taste like water. The latte definitely had the shot sit too long before being poured because it was super bitter. The barista clearly didn't know how to pour coffee and was unable to tell me how much vanilla went in a tall hot chocolate. She was, however, very kind so I gave it two stars instead of one. I won't be going back, though.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Aug 29, 2019~Absolutely the slowest drive thru I've ever been to. Granted it was a weekday morning but unless everyone is ordering 10 custom drinks this is ridiculous!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jun 17, 2019~Slow slow drive thru!!! Almost every visit! Some employees are nice some are RUDE and not helpful!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Oct 7, 2017~I go to this starbucks often since its located right by my home. The staff is always friendly and upbeat which makes for a good experience. The only negative is that the drive though is right off Osborn so its a little difficult to go through the drive though if theres a line.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jun 10, 2014~Slowest Starbucks in Phoenix. Whether I'm the only car in the drive thru, in a line through the parking lot (often), or waiting inside, they have never been faster than a 10 min wait time.If you find yourself on the corner of Osborn and 7th, keep driving. Not worth it.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~May 23, 2019~This location seems to ALWAYS have such a long wait, even when there are only 2 cars ahead of me I am waiting what feels like forever! And then on top of that, the past four visits I go through the drive thru on my lunch, the give me my iced coffee with a broken straw. Literally split all the way down.. good thing I have extra straws at work..
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Sep 23, 2017~The drive thru is their main focus. If you walk in to grab something expect to wait a LONG time and when you ask why others that ordered after you have gotten theirs before you did, be prepared for the guy behind the counter to be rude back to you.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Sep 5, 2016~Everyone who works at this location is extremely rude. The couple times I have been here I have wanted to buy the coffees of the people in the drive thru behind me as a random act of kindness and the person running the window has always been extremely rude about it. What's wrong with wanting to spread a little kindness? I will not be going to this location anymore!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Oct 11, 2017~Whoever was working the driverhru he did a terrible job. We were in the drive-through and I repeated my order three times. The Barista still got it wrong. The cinnamon dolce pumps for my wife's drink were not sugar-free, and he gave us a venti cold brew that we did not order, but were charged for. (Maybe the sound system is messed up?) Oh well, i guess I will remove the ice and have a cold brew saved for when I work late tonight :-) im sticking to 16st/Bethany location in future.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jun 20, 2017~Four workers here running around getting nothing done. Waited 10 minutes for an iced tea. The place wasn't packed so there was no reason for them to take so long making a simple drink. And no apology for the long wait. This place is not typical of how a Starbucks store should be run.Stopped here on 6/20 only because I was shopping nearby. Still poor service: none of the staff were friendly, and the service was slow. Groups of people hanging around for up to ten minutes waiting for their drinks. Starbucks needs to bring a new manager to this location to get it turned around.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Oct 1, 2016~Four workers here running around getting nothing done. Waited 10 minutes for an iced tea. The place wasn't packed so there was no reason for them to take so long making a simple drink. And no apology for the long wait. This place is not typical of how a Starbucks store should be run.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Aug 28, 2014~Darby made my drink and she was terrible. She was not following proper procedure to create the beverage and when I pointed it out, she rolled her eyes. This store constantly has issues with beverage quality and the baristas are not friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Dec 28, 2013~This Starbucks is never open at 5am when I try to stop by.  One morning I wasn't in a rush so I patiently waited for them to get their stuff together.  A half hour later I finally got my coffee.  I don't always have that luxury.This morning, the interior lights were on but there was an employee standing outside, knocking on the door, to have no one open it for him.  The drive thru board was off as I drove through irritated that once again they were not open.  This was at 5:10am.  Every time I visit the store first thing in the morning they have not been open. I don't plan on visiting this store again.  It's obvious there's a trend with the employees that they can't get to work on time.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Sep 17, 2016~I only visit this location because it's close to my work. However this is the last time I visit this location. The drive through is super slow, and my coffee is never done right. This morning they messed my drink up twice it was so disgusting and I wasn't going to have them redo my drink just to mess it up again. Not recommending this Starbucks to anyone.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Sep 25, 2016~Weekends at this location are terrible. They never have enough staff.  Enter off next door at Urban Beans.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Nov 14, 2016~The location of this Starbucks is great! Cozy atmosphere and good outdoor seating. I work very close to this location, so against my better judgment I end up going here anyways because of it being convenient. With that being said, they are always out of something! Whether it be lemonade or cold brew or peach flavoring...It's very inconsistent. Oh and I've had simple questions about my rewards card and no employee is ever willing to help it seems. I'm a bother. I do feel terrible for the staff members because the shipment is never correct(No syrup,tea,lemonade) or on time and they get the complaints. All and all I'm lucky that there are lots of other Starbucks around!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Feb 3, 2016~Starbucks does not have quality drinks any more.... Every time I order from them they screwed you over with the price and steal shots from your cup. Everything taste really watered-down and I'm not any longer a fan of Starbucks. I'm a big fan of coffee and I recommend any coffee shop around here but Starbucks. Urban been next-door is a Fabulous place to get served with quality coffee
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Nov 16, 2016~I've been out of state for 4 months and I see nothing has changed. Slowest and most incompetent Starbucks ever. Wow. It makes me sad. I was so excited to have a drive thru Starbucks this close to home too. I've tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Customer service is a shitty job but damn.  I'd be fine with the smug attitude if they weren't so damn slow.. or just mind numbingly inefficient. How many times can you mess up iced coffee or a iced green tea? Drive thru sucks. Going inside sucks. Is the management bad here? Maybe that's why the staff is cranky? What's the deal?
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Apr 7, 2016~I go to Starbucks often, I go to this particular Starbucks the most because it is down the street from my house. I always go through the drive thru and they get my order wrong about 50% of the time. Either they hand me the completely wrong drink or misunderstand my order and don't clarify. I'll be going out of my way to find another Starbucks from now on as this problem seems to be getting worse and there is never any apology or service recovery attempted by staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Apr 30, 2021~i ordered a venti and i know i did because i was going to have a long day , after they made my drink i saw that it was in a grande cup so i told them and they said `"nope you ordered a grande`" i told them that i didn't and there might've been a mix up and asked if they could give me right size drink and she refused , and said i could go back and pay for a venti. i really wish i would've seen her name , she was rude and she had horrible customer service . it wasn't my fault she didn't hear me correctly, they should've gave me the correct size . this wasn't the first time that this happened with the same cashier, when i was ordering someone came in and said they got the wrong size . i always go to this location and this is the first time they've messed up my order.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Sep 14, 2017~This is the comment I just sent to corporate customer service:I just walked out of your 7th St. &amp; Osborne store in Phoenix, AZ for the second time in a month. This last time was one of the most dehumanizing treatments I've felt. I walked in after walking miles from my job to get there. I was tired and thirsty. There was likely a whole crew of young people in the middle area just inside the doors. One of the male employees carried in another table and dropped it loudly on the floor while I was standing there. After that, they all turned to stare at me and not say a word. Time went by. Still nothing. I asked them if they were open. A girl replied that they were, but she just had to do some of those things before a certain time. Another customer walks in. They greet the customer: `"Hello, there! Welcome to Starbucks!`" No staring involved or horizontal violent looks. I didn't get greeted. As I walked up to the pastries and the front counter, I still had to wait for someone. They didn't speak to me again. I finally got the idea that maybe I should just leave. As I walked out, the girl at the counter said, `"Thank you!`" Someone might want to explain that the customers pay those folks' wages and that maybe they shouldn't act like that as there's another small business coffee shop next door that was glad for my business. Shame on whoever keeps employees like that. What if they did that to your loved ones? How would you feel?
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jul 2, 2016~Horrible service yet again and a Starbucks. Order a Venti passion tea, get to the window &amp; the girl says the $7 and change was not enough. She named some other drink that I told her I did not order &amp; she snapped back yes you did. At that point, forget it and drove off. Speaking with Jasmine (manager) that replies `"I don't see what the problem is`" keep my money and your LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Sep 7, 2016~Be prepared to wait AT LEAST 10minutes for drive through coffee. Been here about 5 times and it never fails on the wait. Save time, go somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Apr 18, 2017~I really like this Starbucks, I come here almost daily and order the exact same thing the reason I choose this one over every other Starbucks is because they always add the perfect amount of sugar and cream to my coffee, at other places it's either too bitter are too sweet. Plus they are always friendly here, only once have I received my coffee from a guy with an angry face who probably doesn't know how to smile. Overall this place is my favorite.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~May 16, 2017~I avoid this Starbucks because of the extremely slow service. I was in the area this morning with my two young boys and popped in to get a coffee and snack for them. Really bad idea. Long line, employee did not know how to ring drinks properly and had to get help. My order ended up holding up the line as I had to wrangle my children because it took so long for her to figure it out. The order was a kids vanilla steamer I've successfully ordered dozens of times. Drinks took at least 10 minutes, for some customers it seemed to be about 15. I noticed complaints throughout the store. The woman who seemed to be managing was friendly enough, but was walking around cleaning windows. As someone who has worked in this industry I believe the manager should step in when things are going this poorly. Corporate needs to step in and figure out how to make this Starbucks function properly.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jul 1, 2016~I really wish I could give this location 0 stars but they make you give it at least one to review. Ok so this location is not that old a couple years, maybe 2. It is the worst Starbucks I have ever been too and I visit a Starbucks about 4x a week. Its the closest stand alone to my house and on my way to work and I still drive out the way to avoid this location. The service is bad, slow, incompetent and rude. The manager is no better. It is ALWAYS backed up and your order will always be wrong. Soooo if you are okay with that by all means stop in. For a better experience visit the one on 7th ave and McDowell or 7th ave and Missouri...
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Feb 11, 2016~This location is on my way to work and I literally drive past work to go to another location because their service here is so bad. Long wait times wrong drinks, poor attitude it never ends. Today I decided to give it another chance the drive thru line was out the parking lot with no movement so I went inside there was nobody in front of me. I ordered my drink promptly and waited...and waited and waited while FIVE staff stood around and one made drinks. The pretty boys at the window fixed their hair and makeup. When I finally hot my drink he just set it in the counter, I said is this my drink he said `"what did you order`"? I told him...he said `"oh giggle giggle, I think or it may be something else, taste it`"...I grabbed the drink because at this point I just needed caffeine and to get to work and left...won't go back...no matter how close it is
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Nov 18, 2013~I visited the establishment on Friday 11/15 in the afternoon.I give this place 3 stars for the following reasons:1.  Service was on the slow side at the registers (4 people in one line, 1 cashier - possible staffing issues).2.  The wi-fi is PAINSTAKINGLY SLOW!! (with only 3-4 people present in dining area).  Internet speeds clocked in at less than 1Mbps at times.. never better than 1.5 Mbps (could hardly read emails, browse websites - and yes same experience on laptop, tablet device as well as phone).
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jan 14, 2016~Slowest Starbucks in the Valley! :( I never have enough time to go here before work. Sucks because it is the closest one to my house w/a drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Apr 28, 2014~This is an unusual Starbucks as it's located in an old bank building (wondering which beans they keep in the vault?).  Otherwise, nothing much to report from the western front.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Jun 16, 2017~Living fairly close by, and always having a craving for Starbucks coffee, I frequent this Starbucks often and a at a variety of hours.  One would say that I'm a regular customer.  While it had its problems early on after it was built and had its Grand Opening, for the last several years it's quality of service has consistently improved.  I use the Drive Thru regularly which seems to be used frequently by a lot of other customers.  I am always greeted very promptly and my order taken quickly and efficiently.  My wait time in line is very acceptable, and frequently very short.  I'm greeted at the window promptly with a smile and payment handled efficiently.  My order is handed to me quickly and cheerfully, and I'm off with no muss or fuss.  I'm a satisfied customer.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Sep 10, 2017~I almost didn't stop in to this location because of the insane parking problems - half the shared local business's tiny lot is VALET on a Saturday afternoon for some insane reason (somebody apparently deluded themselves into thinking that would be an absolutely brilliant a idea ??) But after 5 minutes I found a space and stopped into grab a coffee. I have to say that the staff was awesome. The guy running the registered was very engaging with the customers and I ended up chatting with him for a bit. With all the negative press about young people I have to say that there are some really good, hard working young folks at this location doing a great job. Each of them I dealt with were efficient, fast, courteous and gregarious. They even asked about my jiu-jitsu shirt and we had a laugh or two. Thanks for the great service guys!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Mar 10, 2017~The drive through line is always VERY slow. They have gotten my order wrong the last 3 times. Today gave me regular milk when I ordered and paid for almond milk.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jun 12, 2016~This Starbucks has to be the slowest Starbucks in Arizona. I know places can get busy at certain times but today I was the only car in line and also didn't see many people inside and it still took like 20 mins to make a simple black iced tea. I also told the guy I had my own cup and when I got to the window he hands me a cup. I'm surprised this place even had the ingredients to make it as they always are out of stuff. Do your self a favor and go to the Starbucks on 32nd st and Thomas. They are always fast and friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Aug 24, 2015~The worst service!! It's either a bad attitude or a lack of urgency!! I mentioned it to the supervisor and no change. Only reason why I was coming here was the convenience and Drive-thru. This is just another example of why you need to avoid chains, they think they can do whatever and you'll still be inclined to purchase their product.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Jun 13, 2016~Always a great place to stop in on an errand run. Quite the great staff and always hospitable to the disabled like me.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Jan 6, 2019~Great Starbucks, baristas are super friendly and attentive. I go out of my way to come to this location if I'm not already in the neighborhood.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Jul 28, 2016~One of my favorite location the Baristas are always helpful, friendly,and personable for instance one day I came in and did not know what I wanted to order because it was a hot day and I did not want a coffee the Barista Jazmin suggested one of her favorite which was a black tea 3 pumps of classic 3 pumps of peach with apple juice it is now my favorite drink  2 get.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Sep 30, 2015~I come here to work in the evening pretty often and the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. Although I definitely understand the comments about the long wait time at the drive through, this Starbucks is in a great location and has a great atmosphere. You can tell they put a lot of effort into designing the building, which makes for a pleasant environment to sip a cup an iced pumpkin spiced latte while surfing the web!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Feb 20, 2017~This is by far the worst starbucks I've ever been to. It's so bad, that I feel obligated to write a review which is something I hardly take time to do. 15 minutes for a pike place coffee on the drive thru? Great work guys!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jan 13, 2017~Went to get coffee at 8:30pm. Store was closed. Both website and store sign said open until 9pm. Not a good way to do business.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Aug 2, 2015~Slowest drive thru ever. Doesn't matter if it's a weekend. They take forever. I've left my place extra early twice so i can get a coffee and then head to work. One time i got to work late and the second time, i was almost late. Dont waste your time - Go to another drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Jan 7, 2014~I usually wouldn't write a review for a Starbucks, but this one is special. Located in the Old School plaza on the corner of 7th Street and Osborn, this is one of the most well designed Stabucks I have seen. There is a nice shaded outdoor space with a giant couch and several tables. Inside, there are several 2-4 person tables with one large family style table in the center.As for the service and coffee...its what you would expect from Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Feb 10, 2017~The only reason I would even give this location Any stars at all is consistency ... consistently terrible ... I don't have high expectations for a stop and go in a hurry , but usually Starbucks is always decent and friendly anywhere you go . This one is terrible . Every time . The people are vacant and clueless , the drinks are always bad , the fraps are literally never ever blended well, and the wait time is absolutely ridiculous . They typically forget any food I order and nobody looks up to acknowledge your existence if you try to go get someone's attention . I never leave reviews , It's not my thing , but this is consistently the worst Starbucks I've ever been to.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Aug 11, 2016~I love this Starbucks! I am truly shocked at the two star average rating for this location! My original intention was to specifically mention Todd, and how amazing he is with customer service and providing a human experience, which is something that we generally, as people, don't get anymore these days! The staff here is truly excellent! Sean is awesome, as well!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Oct 13, 2018~It doesn't seem to matter if I use the app or go to the store, my order is always wrong. I've ordered the same thing every time. Salted Cold Foam Cold Brew. Nothing special added just straight from the menu. Still every time I've showed up to pick up it's wrong. And then they just quickly put it together so I get about have coffee half foam and none of the other ingredients. I thought ordering ahead would give them time to get it right but no. Not wasting money at this place anymore.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Dec 23, 2015~If you're stopping by during the morning rush hour you will probably have a long wait here! They are always super busy and tend to have a long line. Luckily Starbucks made it easy for me to have zero wait through they're amazing app. I just pre-order my drink when I'm heading there and they always have it ready for me when I arrive  Baristas are friendly and always helpful. Parking kind of sucks here so just be wary of that. Overall, it's what you expect of a Starbucks with a nice patio and friendly staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Aug 14, 2018~This location is very slow. I walked in and stood at the counter for a solid couple minutes before one of the two behind the counter even acknowledged me.  They need to go train with the 7th st and Willetta as they have spectacular energy and chia toner service!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Apr 25, 2014~The drive thru is usually consistently efficient but don't bother going inside...they are slow, unfriendly and disorganized.  I have no idea how that is but I've been stopping in here pretty regularly for a few months and this is what I always get!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Nov 8, 2013~Brevé Cappachino!  I've never been a big fan of taste of Starbucks coffee but, certainly, it's always a welcoming environment.  However, today...my coffee was brilliantly made...even in the paper cup!  Hoo-rah, for the new Starbucks on 7th St and Osborn!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Jul 21, 2018~Terrible WiFi connection. Don't plan to work at this location. Nothing wrong with the drinks or service, but I came with an expectation that I'd be able to do work like at any other Starbucks location, but that was thwarted by shoddy WiFi. I even had to switch to LTE to post this review from within the store.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Mar 23, 2014~7 minutes to get an iced tea. I was inside and there was no one in front of me.  I rarely come to this location because it always takes this long whether its peak times or not.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jul 21, 2017~Starbucks needs to close this location or relocate it. The parking is consistently inadequate and the drive up is horribly configured. The service is mediocre, and they consistently close an hour or two before their published closing time. It is no wonder that the independent coffee shop less than a block away does an excellent business
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Jan 27, 2017~This location serves the standard Starbucks drinks and has a midrange selection of Starbucks nonbeverage products. Its hours and crowd management are a mess. The location was set up so that during the morning rush hour the drive up traffic backs up onto Osborn. Someone is going to get killed due to this poor design. To make this matter worse, they consistently close early. I stopped by at 8:15 pm tonight and their walk in and drive up were closed (advertised hours are that they are open until 9:00 pm). They routinely close at 8:30 pm.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Jun 14, 2014~If you have nothing but time to kill, and get off on wasting your time in line, this is the place to be! I usually enjoy my visits to Starbucks because of friendly and professional employees who do their best to be courteous, but at the same time try to get your drink to you quickly without making the experience feel rushed.I've been to this store a few times since it opened last year, but in the last three months, my last two experiences have been nothing short of terrible. The first time was in late April. It was 1:19pm, my friend and I walk in to a store with one customer sipping his drink and one customer in line, then us. In the drive-thru there were only two cars in line. Behind the counter were four baristas. The customer in front of us places his order, which was simple, and then we order ours (grande caramel machiato and venti ice coffee with cream and 4 pumps of white mocha). What should've been a simple minimal wait turned into the customer in front of us and my friend and I finally getting our orders at 1:40pm! Twenty minutes for three drinks. The second occurrence was Mon. June 9th. In the neighborhood, jonesin for caffeine and we pop into the drive-thru, which had was about 5 cars deep. This time was just as bad as we waited 15 mins from the moment we placed our order to the moment we got to the window. What made this worse was the fact that we get to the front of the line and both of our orders were wrong! We told the young lady working the window our order three times (those keeping count, that's four times that our order was given. I could expect that from a child, but not a grown-up who could hear well), and then finally another young lady had to come take our order again. I peeped in the the drive-thru window and noticed only 3 customers sitting down and enjoying their drinks, no one in line, and four employees `"working`" behind the counter. I know one young lady was new this time, but a lot of the other employees I recognize from the very busy store at Park Central mall and from various other stores. I have to wonder why I've come here two times and waited 20 minutes for two simple drinks. I know, it's easy to say they had newbies, long lines and what not, but the Starbucks by my place, and even Park Central, are busy quite a bite and I've almost always been able to get in and out of there in less that 5-10 minutes. The same goes for other Starbucks I've been to around the country (Yes, I'm a coffee fiend, and I know it's time for help). Needless to say, next time I need some coffee and I'm near this one, I'll go to Dunkin Donuts or go the extra few blocks to Park Central, or go somewhere else. Time to step up your game guys! Good luck!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Apr 5, 2014~Slowest Starbucks ever! Going on 15min for vanilla latte. 15min may not sound long, but for a drink, on a slow morning.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jul 18, 2014~Slowest Starbucks in the valley. Three times I've visited and service worse every time. Very disappointing.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jun 18, 2014~Horrible service. Long wait times.  No communication.  Over staffed and under performing.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Nov 13, 2014~This has thee SLOWEST drive thru of all the Starbucks! At this moment I've been in line for 14 minutes and there's still 2 cars in front of me, not sure what the problem is but I need to find a new location!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Nov 16, 2014~This is hands down the slowest Starbucks I have been to in the world. I've lived in the area for 4 months and the drive through regularly takes 15 minutes despite maybe 4 people in line.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Mar 18, 2016~Worst service for people in a hurry. I called and placed an order for a box of coffee to go. Wife went to pick up 15 min later and they didn't have the order ready AND claimed that we called a different store and had no record of it. So I called back the number that I used to place the order and sure enough I called the RIGHT one. Manager needs to go or something else needs to change.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Jun 30, 2015~Starbucks is pretty much the McDonald's of coffee.  Not cheap but you know you will get the same thing the same way at every single location.  The coffee is good, I like the dessert element they make coffee into.  The food is ok and you can usually count on it being consistent and fresh.  The writing of your name on the cup in TOTALLY obtuse and weird phonetic fashion has got to be something they either train them for or look for that quality when they are hiring.  The staff is not ignorant and they are always pleasant and courteous.  I love the new Cool Refreshers to take to yoga!  Yum.  I also like the new app they have which makes the whole ordering, paying and tipping process cashless.  That makes it convenient and make a me more likely to search out a Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Aug 31, 2017~Man, this drive thru is THE slowest. You go inside, still slow. Ugh. Also `"light ice`" does not mean half a cup of ice! If you made me wait and the drink was good that is one thing but make me wait for overpriced coffee and you gave me half a cup of ice. Gonna drive further next time. I have given this silly place too many chances.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Feb 13, 2014~Boo. There is already a great coffee shop on this corner  Urban Beans. Stay local get better service and food and drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Nov 17, 2014~If you want a quick cup of coffee do NOT come here. There is always a wait (even when there is nobody in line). I come here 5-10 times at different times of the day and it is still ridiculously slow. So much that I had time to create this account and post a review.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Oct 18, 2013~Just your standard Starubucks with a new industrial modern look.  The interiors is cute.  BUT... WORST PARKING LOT EVER!  - So pay attention when you go thru the parking lot.  And don't use the drive-thru, you lazy people.  You know who you are... You almost got me into 3 seperate accidents this morning.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Feb 27, 2015~Great location but the high volume of customers is too much for it! Arrived at 8:18 am. Drive thru line was ridiculously long so decided to inside instead. Either way I was doomed. I didn't leave until 8:42 with the 2 drinks I ordered. Needless to say I was late to work. And they always seem to be out of products in the afternoon when I go.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Mar 21, 2014~Nothing to write home about. It's hit or miss when it comes to good service. It's also hit and miss when it comes to drink integrity. Some days the iced coffee I order is great and others it's over sweetened or had too much milk.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Jul 16, 2014~Stopped in this morning around 7:40am and the drive thru line was packed.  I walked in to a busy inside, but promptly ordered, and had my drink in less than five minutes.  Quite the turn around from last time.  Hope it stays this way.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Jun 27, 2014~Like everyone else I have the same complaints. Wait times here are excessive with 10-15 minutes the norm in the mornings. Service is meh. Staff is not excited to be here. Wifi access is awful. Be prepared...  At least my drink was fine.The store was newly built last year and is quite nice but it sits on small lot with limited parking and short cue area for drive thru. It does have a nice outdoor patio, and is next door to amazing taco / enchilada restaurants.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Jul 25, 2014~This place doesn't have enough parking to handle lunch hours. The patrons here never know what they want. It isn't Starbucks fault, but it does make this Starbucks hard to enjoy. The baristas are great though.  The store itself is clean and comfortable.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~4~Mar 8, 2015~As we all know Starbucks is the best. But this location has great customer service and really friendly staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~May 21, 2016~Slooooooow. I went inside because I thought the drive-through might be slower. Bad call. It took them 10 minutes to ring up the person ahead of me and then, low and behold, they weren't ready for me. I could have gone somewhere else and had an entire meal by now. This place is unbelievably inefficient. I will never be back here.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jun 16, 2015~I love starbucks but this location ruins it for me,yesterday on 15jun15 me,my sister and god daughter came in to get some frappuccinos,first of all the cashier didnt even say good afternoon or asked if we needed help or nothing,he was just looking at us and waited for us to ask him for our frappuccinos......also i needed help to redeem a free drink that I had received for signing up to the app and they called the manager and she couldn't help so that was already bugging me...but still I bought 2 drinks either way,they took a long time and it was slow and when our drinks where done nobody called them out,they just set them in the counter and none of the employees said have a great day or nothing so that really pissed me off...Im never coming to this starbucks again hope you guys can do something about this
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Mar 11, 2014~I would have thought they would have better service considering the overabundance of staff. Kind of an `"iffy`" location. Not easy in &amp; out access. Parking behind store only.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~May 27, 2014~The employees at this Starbucks really do not care to do theirjob well.I ordered a `"complicated`" drink--a dirty nonfat chai with 3 shots of espresso. I waited for that drink and my boyfriend's black coffee for quite some time, while other patrons who ordered after us received their drinks. Once the girl who took our order realized she never sent them in, the barista made the black coffee (no apology or free pastry offered). I then asked where my drink was, and he said it was the `"chai tea`" that was on the counter (it had been there for 10  minutes, but no one would assume a chai tea is their nonfat dirty chai with extra espresso). I asked him `"do you mean this is the nonfat dirty chai?`" He said yeah, but it definitely was not. By then I was late to my doctor's appointment and had to leave with my less than adequate $5 drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Oct 19, 2016~Drinks at this location are so inconsistent. But even my best experience at this store is lackluster. I used to work for Starbucks and know the standards of a typical latte. My milk is always oversteamed. A latte should be 148 degrees unless specified extra hot (which will put it at 156). I can tell you that my milk is burned 90 percent of the time (which means anything over 180 degrees). As a result the milk becomes more aerated and by the time I can take a sip of it (which is 15 minutes later because it's so hot), half of the latte has disappeared from the milk finally settling. Their drive thru is painfully slow most days but I can tell they're making an effort to increase their productivity. My main concern is the quality of the latte I'm purchasing. The only reason I still frequent this location is because it's a stone's throw away from my work. These baristas need some training on basic latte skills ASAP.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Jul 29, 2016~The service is good. However, parking is typically an issue. If you are meeting someone here, you should come early to make sure you can get a spot.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Dec 8, 2013~I rarely leave negative reviews.. but this is consistently the worst service out of any Starbucks I've been to - EVER. Unfortunately I go here because it is close to my house and I love starbucks iced coffee... But almost ALL the employees are always completely out of it, slow, not eager to help, and constantly make mistakes because thy aren't listening/don't care. It's so weird - I actually really think Starbucks manager and corporate staff would not be happy. Normally I love starbucks but this is more like an overstaffed-yet-super-slow store pretending to be starbucks. It's not fast or efficient like the brand is known for. It's like everyone hired here are high school dropouts with no desire to do anything. It's bad service EVERYTIME and the drive thru line is always really slow because the chick they always have it makes so many mistakes. Also- they never have the creamer out on the weekend mornings and it's like pulling teeth trying to get their attention to ask for it. All I get is a black iced coffee, and it ALWAYS takes at LEAST 10 minutes.... on the weekends after 10am. Not their busiest time. The line is just long because all the workers are alway so confused.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Oct 28, 2015~Employees have an attitude. Was sitting here doing some work, asked for water and had the `"barista`" give me attitude and practically throw my order at me.  Cashiers tend to be friendly on some days and short and rude on others.  Coffee is blah compared to local shops.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Feb 6, 2016~I've been to DOZENS of Starbucks in many cities and this is by far the worst. Given them 4 tries. Long waits even when I was only 1 of 2 people. Wrong orders and burnt tasting coffee. They are literally a one minute drive from my house and I will not use them again
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Feb 27, 2014~I like this one, nice people, nice atmosphere, great location, I just for the life of me can't figure why whether in drive thru or in store, the service is sooooo slow and they often get drinks wrong! Not sure where the blame should go!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jul 4, 2016~I don't think I've ever felt compelled to write a review of a Starbucks regardless of what the service was, but this place is just absolutely ridiculous. I'm staying in Phoenix for the summer from out of town, and this place is the closest to the house. I've been here several times and each time I'm left dumbfounded about how slow, unprofessional, and inefficient this place is. The first time I was there, I order a passion iced tea, not sweetened and a bagel with cream cheese over the drive through. The lady I was talking to me asked me if wanted the tea sweetened. I repeated that no, I did not want it sweetened. When I was picking up my order, I again asked if the drink had been sweetened and was told no, but it was. In addition to that, when they handed me the bagel I noticed there was no cream cheese in there and asked for some. I was rudely told that it was in the bag, and when I repeated that no it is not, the girl at the window proceeded to yell to her coworker if she had put cream cheese in the bag, and then finally gave me a packet. Every time that I've been there since I've had to wait over 10 minutes for my order even when there was only 1 person in front of me. And just today when I was picking up some tea, the girl climbed up on to the counter (shoes on and everything, not that them being off would've been better) to get it from a box they had in the cabinet. I'm short, so I totally get having to climb on things, but the counter wasn't cleaned in the 10 minutes I had to wait to have hot water poured into a cup with a teabag in there and who knows if it was cleaned later on .. it's the same place they use to toast sandwiches/bagels whatever. so that's really gross and unsanitary. Overall, I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone to visit
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Aug 8, 2014~Coming into this Starbucks is like having to remove an eyelash out of ones eye!  It's painful and irritating. The service is consistently SLOW and the service is `"caddy and downright bitchy`" from the barista side of the counter. 12 minutes to wait for an iced coffee. NO LIE OR EXAGGERATION. The store is laid out in a way that is confusing and wearing of the patience while waiting for a drink as there is mass chaos and confusion.  I know I have choice and other locations but this location is convenient to work and home and I try to go in each time with a glimmer of hope that it will be different but sadly it is not. Upper management needs to address the poor customer service and store layout.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Nov 14, 2014~For the number of staff at this Starbucks, I am at a complete loss how it takes so long to get coffee. I regularly have to wait a few minutes before a cashier takes my order, and they have given me the wrong size or blend of coffee on multiple occasions.  The drive-thru is typically 5-10 cars deep, and it takes an inordinately long time compared to other Starbucks .  I'm not sure if there are staffing problems or are just disorganized.  Great location, but disappointing service.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Jan 22, 2015~Get ready to wait. While there is always a good number of staff working, it take so long to get an order. I gone here using the drive thru and walk in and it is the same. Not sure if this is a management issue or a staffing issue but it needs some work. Nothing is wrong with the product that they serve just how it is served. Not what I would expect from SB.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Dec 22, 2016~wasn't a busy time in the day, only one person in front of me and still had to wait 10 minutes to get service and staff was rude for no reason.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Nov 28, 2014~Service is VERY SLOW. Some of the people working there can be really bitchy, specially some redhead dude, run away from him or he might throw hot coffee on your face for wishing him a good morning. They are ALWAYS out of stuff. Not a good location, won't be going back.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Mar 30, 2014~So let's not get it twisted; Starbucks is Starbucks. No matter where you go you know what to expect when it comes to the drinks and food. This means that the only thing that will separate one Starbucks from the next is the staff. And this Starbucks staff is absolutely amazing. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is amazing. They are fun, they are friendly, they are real. It is nice to have a Starbucks where `"everybody knows your name`" rather than the caricature of a corporate business moving into town to kick out all of the mom and pop shops.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jan 4, 2015~Its a Starbucks.  No biggee.  But if you've lived in this country for more than 3 decades you've likely been to your fair share of Starbucks.  I know I have.  And I also know that this one has quite a bit of work to do to even get to `"sub-par.`" This place needs a serious management work-over.  Unfortunately, its my closest Starbucks and I've given it MANY opportunities to make up for its lackluster performance.  Alas, the only thing this location has managed to do is to CONSISTENTLY disappoint.  So, congrats on that.  For your consistency in kinda sucking.  Slower than molasses.  Not friendly.  ALWAYS out of something.  Always.  For days and days in a row.  Is it really hard to re-order MAJOR ingredients.  Like SOY MILK.  WTF?  Do you keep track of your inventory?  Ever?  Who the hell is in charge of this place?  Anyone?  And I asked for a receipt at the drive-thru.  Dude actually told me he would have to walk all the way over to the other register to get that.  Yup.  Those 10 steps might kill you, dude.  I really try to give people the benefit of the doubt.  That's why I gave this location 10 times to change my mind about their incompetence.  However, the only thing they did with those 10 chances to impress was to convince me that another better-managed coffee place should get my business.  Nice work.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Jun 13, 2013~Sitting in your car and hitting the drive-thru is soooo west coast.  And, I love it!This is one of the first drive-thrus in the area for the Green Mermaid.  Surprisingly, there's a new `"Pot Bellies`" sandwich place going in right next door. Hmmm, might need to leave my car for that one. LOLLast night I received from Starbucks Galactic Command in SODO, a Member's Reward coupon for 50% off my next espresso beverage using Code 354.  Nice timing I thought. Drove by here around 9 this morning and there was six cars in front of me. It took less than five minutes for me to get to the front of the line, get my drink and pay. A Tip of the Hat as Colbert would say to the very fast baristas!Simple, fast and easy.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Aug 5, 2020~I left the Starbucks drive-thru in tears. Thank you so much to the cashier that smiled at me before I left; I haven't been smiled at by a stranger in a while:) I felt so darn good after that drive thru that I was smiling cheek to cheek with tears coming out I haven't had that feeling in a while. Thank you so much. I ordered two Bacon Gouda sandwiches. Delicious I included a photo of what I ordered so the team at Starbucks can grab the details from the bag and pin point who made my day a whole of a lot better:) Please make sure she gets this message! Brunette hair, beautiful smile:)
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jan 3, 2016~Sadly I'm a bit of a Starbucks fiend, especially for this location due to its close proximity to my job. Morning traffic when I come to the drive thru is normally a bit crazy or absolutely dead. The few times I've had to go inside due to an insane car line, the employees are super quick to get my order complete. Speaking of, the employees are nothing but kind. Every time I've visited, I'm always asked how I'm doing/greeted good morning. A pleasant conversation + a smile + some AM caffeine is a great way to start my day.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Jan 31, 2016~Glad Starbucks is already starting their holiday menu even though it's not even Thanksgiving!So to warm things up, it's going to be  a triple espresso with a dash of sugar and a slight dash of cream, not to much otherwise one will wind up with a strong cup of coffee.They had their Kenyan blend which I think makes an awesome espresso!This is my regular Starbucks, so the people are always friendly, service tries to be quick but when you have 30 beverages to make in 3 minutes there might be a slight delay.Decided to take a few photos of the new Starbucks art work that is popping up in the stores.  Adds a bit to the decor don't you think?
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Dec 5, 2019~This is the best Starbucks I've been to! It never has a long line and always greeted with the best smile! The manager is so kind and she cares about her customers and her employees! I now only go to this Starbucks because I know I will get great coffee, service, and feel happier after leaving!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Oct 24, 2016~Okay. I've been to this location several times and maybe never got an amazingly warm and fuzzy feeling from them and frequently they get my order wrong (how hard is iced green tea unsweetened?) but haven't had anywhere near the rude experience I had there today. I was in the parking lot visiting another shop and placed a mobile order upon leaving and headed to the store to pick up my drink. I've been stuck in a very long line there before and I like the convenience of mobile order and pay. So, my drink is ready and correct. They were polite when I picked it up and walked over to sit at a table. I sit there enjoying my drink and attempt to get a refill before leaving. What I got was a hassle and a lecture by a barista who thinks he can dictate Starbucks policy by telling people they can't have refills on mobile orders because it has to be same store same visit. Well, this WAS the same store and the same visit. I sat ten feet from the counter for cripes sake. According to their website, free refills are supposed to be honored for mobile orders provided you don't leave the store. I'm a gold member and have been a Starbucks gold card holder for six years. This has NEVER happened at any other stores. Is it some sort of Scottsdale snobbery or something? Either way, I'll be skipping this a-hole location from now on. Life's too short for putting up with pretentious jerks.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Feb 7, 2015~OK, a Starbucks is a Starbucks is a Starbucks but this is MY `"home`" Starbucks so I feel like I should review it. I roll through here 3 or 4 times a week on my way into work and the staff is always friendly and fast. Add in the fact they have a drive thru  and I am always happily caffeinated while never being late for work. Win, win.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~3~Mar 10, 2017~Lesson learned: When your guests order food and sit down, you should call them when the entire order is ready.  Having to go back and forth to the counter for each item is ridiculous. I ordered all items at the same time, I should be able to receive all items at the same time.  It is just that simple!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~4~Jan 16, 2015~Even though I live closer to the FLW/101 location I often find myself going through this drive through instead because it's that's much better. Rarely have more than 3 cars in front of me and most time there is no wait. My order always been correct which I can't say the same for some of the other locations.Occasionally I decide to get out of my car and go inside. It's a newer Starbucks so it has the clean, minimalist lay out. -1 star because of Starbucks being in love with Monsanto.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Oct 29, 2015~This Starbucks is my favorite. The drive thru moves fast. They give great drink recommendations when you have a sore throat. The people are pleasant.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Sep 16, 2014~Awesome customer service , I go to this location specifically for the great employees
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~1~Nov 7, 2015~So I have a soar throat right now not the end of the world. Kinda bums me out that the one time I actually try to give star bucks a try the employees closed it more than a half hour early and just turned off the lights as I walked up to the door.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Oct 22, 2015~The people there are great, and the drinks are never a disappointment! I like to go in there when I have some money to spare.  The atmosphere/ambiance is lovely.
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~Jun 9, 2013~Awesome new location!  The baristas are friendly and knowledgable and the drinks are what you expect from a Starbucks.  There is also a good amount of indoor seating and free wifi
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~May 26, 2013~Love the new location!  The staff seemed well trained and ready to handle the crowds---and people---that Star Bucks tend to draw.   Drinks were well made!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~5~May 21, 2013~Great new location!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~May 19, 2016~I stopped at this Starbucks for the first time this morning before my appt I had in the same complex. I ordered my drink on the mobile app prior to arriving, like I always do for Starbucks. I arrived and my drink was not ready... My arrival time was longer than the suggested time my drink should be ready. Usually I would not mind but remember I am on my way to my appointment and this was intended to be a quick stop. I waited for my drink for at least 5 mins until I asked the barista if they had a mobile order for me, then which my drink had been sitting behind the counter already made, ready togo and waiting. Now I am not happy my drink has been ready but not put where I could pick it up and now I am late for my appointment which resulted me having to wait an extra 45 minutes to get in, no I'm not happy at all. The staff was not rude or kind towards me, they did not apologize for not having my drink in the pickup area either. I go to Starbucks almost everyday and this is the first time it has become an inconvenience especially with my mobile order. it's safe to say I definitely will not be going to this location again.!
Scottsdale, AZ 85254~2~May 31, 2016~Always surprised by the mix of experiences at Starbucks. Stopped by there to get coffee. Drive-thru was a bit backed up so decided to swing by the lobby. I never understand why it needs to take so long to get a cup of coffee at Starbucks. I saw at least 6 people working, all servicing what appeared to be the drive thru. There were three people in line behind me. Got one `"I'll be right with you`" from someone zooming by, and a few minutes later I was finally being helped by a different and rather unfriendly barista. Ordered basic Venti Coffee with room for cream. Once again a cup filled to the brim with no room for cream. Poured out what I didn't want in the trash bin. Perhaps I am going to the wrong Starbucks' locations, but I yet have to experience this amazing service I keep hearing about. Perhaps I expect too much, and I don't really know why I keep going back to Starbucks and receive mediocre service, mediocre coffee in places that most of the time could use a good wipe down. Oh well.
Phoenix, AZ 85331~5~Oct 27, 2019~My Girlfriend and I were driving around exploring, as I was in town for the weekend.  When we decided to Yelp the nearest Starbucks and ended up here.They got my Girlfriend's order wrong, but whatever it was she loved it.  So, I guess that worked out for the best.  My order was made great.The staff was friendly, polite, and provided great customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85331~1~Mar 19, 2022~Worst Starbucks ever. Waited over 15 minutes and still no latte. 1 person making drinks for large queue at drive thru and in store. Plenty of employees standing around doing nothing to make drinks. No manager around to rectify the situation. Terribly run business.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Dec 16, 2023~So we came here at 5:45pm on a Saturday night and the app said they were open until 10pm.They had signs saying that the lobby was closed.So disappointing.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Apr 30, 2024~Starbucks is Starbucks. Drinks are consistent and they are able to customize it. Employees are friendly and able to make drinks relatively quickly because it was slow time.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Nov 10, 2024~The best staff, food and atmosphere!!  :). I highly recommend this Starbucks!! The views  around the area are amazing.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~May 4, 2024~Went into Starbucks on Dove Valley, picked out two mugs they had out for sale. Cashier couldn't ring them up because they weren't `"released yet`" and wouldn't ring up on the register. Was told I couldn't buy them until Monday. I asked if she could hold them for them, was told they can't hold products, and to come back on Monday. What!? First they wouldn't manually ring them up, second they wouldn't hold them for me. They wouldn't break the rule to sell something before it was released, but it was okay to break the rule of putting it on the shelf before the release date. I'm sure it doesn't matter to this big corporation, but I won't be going back in there on Monday or any other day for that matter.I miss customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Oct 31, 2023~I come here often. If you want small town service, this is the place! Yes they are busy often however I've never waited more than 3 minutes for my drink at peak busy times. The service is on point. I work in the cafe a couple times a week and it's comfortable.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Apr 24, 2024~The staff are great. However, it's so loud - blaring music - indoor and outdoor. To top it off, it's not chill music. Always feels more like Club Starbucks. It's not a relaxing environment where you're going to linger, stay, and in turn, buy more. It's a get in and get out situation that feels like nails on a chalkboard due to the sound. I think a lot of us are over the loud music or any music at all in public places. We're bombarded with sounds and technology all day. And outdoor music? Why? What would be nice is listening to the birds chirping in the trees and getting some peace and quiet while enjoying a coffee. Please give us a break and make this Starbucks a more relaxing environment.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Nov 1, 2024~rude staff. ordered and waited 15 minutes for 2 drinks. the drive through line was faster than walking in store and ordering. asked a staff member about our other drink we were waiting on, and his reply was `"idk, im in charge of the drive thru orders, ask someone else`" so rude. not happy with this location
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Feb 13, 2024~So, I just wanted to leave a review for this location because they have the best customer service compared to any other Starbucks I've been to. Every time I show up I'm always greeted, and if my drink is ever made the wrong way, RARELY, it's handled in the most professional way I've ever seen. I have to give this location 5 stars because this place rocks. Keep up the good work!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Oct 10, 2023~I like this location because it's close to my house, but it's not very ideal for studying because they got the music blaring loud like a night club. I asked an employee if they normally have their music super loud, and she said yeah it helps keep them awake as they're working. So, it's very unfortunate that I have to hear their music blasting through my noise cancelling ear buds.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Apr 17, 2023~Great staff, quick service, good selections in stock.   I have officed from this location a few times with great wifi!!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Jul 3, 2021~Not the friendliest staff on a Friday afternoon! We tried to order a mango dragon fruit drink and they were out. The girl offered us a strawberry acai, and said `"It tastes the same`" (uhhhh no but ok).  When ordering I knew what I wanted, but after each item she seemed like she wanted me to stop ordering  (I order three drinks and three pastries) We sat at the window without a greeting and she wasn't friendly when she opened the window...Until she saw I had my phone open to Yelp with a check in!  funny how that changes an attitude.Early morning crew...SUPER NICE AND FRIENDLY!!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Jan 26, 2023~I like coming here but every once in awhile this happens  just add extra milk lol I don't care, but I want it full. Thank you
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Oct 12, 2023~Unfortunately, I agree with the one star reviews. This is the worst Starbucks I've been to. I've been here 3 times and each time there was something missing, incorrect, or not heated properly. What's the point of the drive thru when I end up going inside to tell them my order is wrong.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Sep 8, 2022~This is the best Starbucks I've ever been to. I stopped going as frequently to Starbucks around the country because the partners didn't seem thrilled to be there and would often get very basic drinks wrong. After trying this Starbucks, I started coming back regularly. Each drink is delicious and the service is even better. I'm so spoiled now, it's still hard to go to other locations. Love it here, thank you to this amazing team!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 24, 2022~It's always great  here they know me by name and order!! My neighborhood Starbucks clean, nice employees and always quick!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Oct 27, 2020~Can't stop progress and hell, we have so much desert left to pave over-we can't stop now. That pretty much sums up this little corner at Dove Valley, out in front of the new Fry's shopping center.  Ok, little rant over; let's talk coffee.Talk about a job I could never do, keep track of the shots, flavorings, iced, hot, upside down, thingamajig. They always do such a great job and with a wonderful attitude. I'm sure they have their moments like we all do but by and large, you can pretty much count on a smile and great service at Starbucks.  Iced Americano and Nitro iced coffee have been my go-to's lately.  If you haven't tried the Nitro yet, it's definitely worth the splurge.  So incredibly smooth and tasty, no need for added flavorings or sugars, stuff is amazing.    Quick hit for the Starbucks app.  Truly a great app and a huge timesaver. I can place my order as I leave Apache Wash trailhead four miles away and my order is ready by the time I get there.  We Americans love our coffee and Starbucks certainly has played a large, successful role in that love affair.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Oct 8, 2023~Terrible customer service. One person specifically, not sure of the name but the girl had long somewhat of curly hair and bushy brows. So many times where unfortunately she's at the window and never greets you. I tell her to thank you or have a good day and she says `"yup`". They should really train her or just not have her on drive through.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Jan 18, 2023~I had placed mobile order that said it was going to be ready at 7:06. I am just now getting in the car from getting my drinks at 7:30 which school starts at 7:30 and I rely on Starbucks to be truthful and have the drinks ready at the correct time they say. They make their drive-through customers drinks before they make a mobile order so because of this the  line for mobile orders was huge.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Oct 16, 2022~This starbucks is always clean and quick! Cil is especially fun and she makes a point to get to know customers. I look forward to visiting this one to grab a drink or stay and study.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Sep 4, 2019~I love coming to this Starbucks as the morning crew know me by name and already start working on my order. Don't be fooled by the long lines, unlike the drive-through up in Anthem, they are super quick. If your really in a hurry, you can order through the starbucks app and pick up your order. I would literally go out of my way to come to this location if I had to move.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Feb 5, 2019~Hillary I believe is the manager in the am and she is always so sweet to me, makes sure my drink is right (because I'm difficult) smiles and remembers my name even though I order mobile and only come in twice a week. She makes my morning smoother on my long commute to work! This is also the cleanest and nicest Starbucks I've been in for a while, the team must be doing something right! Love it! Thank you!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Oct 1, 2018~Brand new Starbucks open. It also has a drive thru, yay!!! Love the caramel frappacino!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Dec 18, 2022~I really try to give this Starbucks a chance but yesterday was final straw. I did the drive through and tried to order a peppermint mocha- they are out of peppermint (and we all know they are always running out early if seasonal flavors). I asked if they still had pumpkin spice and the employee on the speaker very rudely said `"No that's been out of season for months! Is there anything you want?`" There was a line behind me so I said I would just pull through and he's like `"great! Have a good day`" but very sarcastically. I worked food service for years so I get having bad days but being a total jerk is not cool. I get around the curve and we are 4 cars deep and I knew  I wouldn't have time to get to the other Starbucks before my 4:30 appt. So I tried to order on the mobile app and that location had it turned off. So I get to the window and asked if I could order a grande caramel brûlée latte. `"lijah`" does a sigh and say `"so you don't want the Carmel macchiato now??`" I tell him that I was the one trying to order a peppermint mocha and was going to drive through but had decided to grab the latte instead since I was stuck in the line and I apologized for the inconvenience. He literally rolls his eyes, sighs and then loudly exclaims to his coworker that `"she didn't want a drink and now she does`" then he closes the window and takes off his headset and starts talking to her. And you don't have to read lips to see he wasn't being nice. Then he comes back and says `"well yea it's going to be awhile`" and closes the window again. I tried calling the store later and today but the line is busy. Hoping a manager will read this and speak with this kid. Customer service is not his forte and something he can work on. I should've just left and wish I had now. But I am not planning on coming back to this location anytime soon or ever
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Oct 21, 2021~One of the busiest locations I have ever seen! The employees are working so hard here to make everyone's orders but they need help! Everything was backed up and the wait was crazy. The car line was in the street, the mobile order was 10 minutes past the time it said, and not even sure about the in store orders. Please hire them help!! They can't work any faster or harder than they already are!Despite the employees being super friendly even though they are overworked, I will not be coming back to this location until they have more employees. The wait is just too long
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Sep 18, 2019~I went to this location at 12:45pm during the week this week and not my first time here so I am a repeat customer (but not after what happened, will not be back here again).  Walked up to the counter, the person working the counter was a tall woman, with brown shoulder length hair.  I ordered a brewed coffee and she informed me that they do not brew coffee after 11:00am.  WHAT???  Starbucks, a coffee house does not brew coffee after a certain time of day?  I asked her if they had ANY flavor of brewed coffee, I was not asking for anything particular and she said no, I can only do a pour over. Now, not everyone works a 8-5 or 9-5 job so someone else's morning cup of Joe may not always be consumed in the early hours of the day.  I have been to several other North Phoenix Starbucks locations and ordered coffee at lunch and mid-afternoon and NEVER have I been told they did not have ANY brewed coffee at those times.   I left and will NEVER come back to this location as I feel I was provided zero customer service!For those of you who know this location, you know there is also a Starbucks stand inside the Fry's across the parking which is where I went next.  I went up to the 2 ladies working and asked them IF they had any brewed coffee and they looked at me like I was crazy for even asking that question.  I laughed and told them what had happened to which they both replied to me that Starbucks is to always have at least 1 brewed coffee option available throughout the day.  They confirmed I was not crazy and I got my cup of Joe and went along with my day, thanks to these two wonderful ladies!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~May 29, 2019~I'm genuinely disappointed in the service I was given at this location. My kids went to get drinks and come out with half filled cups? They ordered talls without ice. Even with no ice, I expected filled cups. This is unacceptable. It was a slap in the face for them to give us unfilled cups. How hard is it to fill a cup up the rest of the way. It was as if they purposely gave us half filled cups because we order no ice. We will not be coming back to this location
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Sep 21, 2018~Very friendly staff &amp; coffee has been great the few times I've stopped in since their opening
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Oct 14, 2020~Without fail my drink is never ready despite using the app and ordering ahead. Constantly have to wait 8-10 minutes. Drink is often incorrect. It's just the worst Starbucks going.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Mar 23, 2020~Worse Starbucks ever. Not abnormal to wait in drive thru 7-10 minutes despite amount of patrons. Drinks have been incorrect more times then I can count.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Feb 17, 2020~Starbucks is consistently good but once I had a not too hot mocha and a sweet young man with a bun Alister... I think was his name tag.. told me to order a 180 degree mocha. Perfect! Now I order that every time. He's real nice gave my family pumpkin spice cold brew samples once awhile back and we were hooked. This guy is very good at service kinda emulates the Starbucks brand friendly and very helpful. Alexis took our order today she's always really cheerful too.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Oct 26, 2020~Tammy was full of positivity, energy, and manners!!! It was such a breath of fresh air this morning to get a coffee with great service. She is amazing and made the coffee that much better!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Oct 25, 2018~ALEXIS IS A SAINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best drive thru in the valley. So kind and quick. And they've never made a bad coffee. Always a solid go-to before my commute to Tempe. Thanks guys!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 10, 2020~I love this store. The location is always busy, but the staff works so hard to create memorable but fast interactions. There is outdoor seating right now and one restroom open (due to Covid). The drive thru line can be problematic but the staff try to keep the line moving quickly so that people can stay in their cars and get their coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~May 29, 2019~I asked for a 3 tall drinks with no ice in a size tall. They gave me the teas filled to the second line! Like are you kidding me?!$5 too! The guy who made it was in training today @5:40pm and clearly didn't know what he was doing! To all my Starbucks users out there, I'm telling you DONT COME TO THIS STARBUCKS! Poor service, very very disappointed!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Jan 30, 2019~I went to Starbucks on Sunday 1/27 to order a spinach wrap and banana and didn't get a copy of my receipt.  I grabbed my banana at the register. When I received my order they gave me a spinach wrap and banana nut bread. I went back to the cashier and asked for a refund because I didn't order the nut bread I ordered a banana. They gave me a refund for the bread but charged me 1.25 for the banana when it was physically marked by the cash register with a price tag at 1.00. When I asked about the difference they indicated they can only refund what was in the system not what was marked. Haley was the manager on duty during this time.It was only .25 but that is not the point. They should have charged me the amount indicated on the physical price tag not what was in the system. The customer should not pay for negligence in updating the tags in the store. This was very poor customer service and a bad experience. My complaint was not handled.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Dec 11, 2020~Never put whip cream on the drinks, even tho you ask them 2 times to make sure. Slowest drive through by far. There is one manager there though that makes the drinks perfect and her lines always go fast. Not sure what the other shift is doing. Can't remember her name but she gave me bandaids and pads for my finger cause she was worried. Thankyou!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Sep 18, 2019~Alexis is awesome! She always sounds so happy taking orders in the drive thru. Having people like Alexis makes that Starbucks location better. Hopefully she doesn't leave for a while! Give her a raise!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 26, 2020~I called the store to check on a seasonal item and Hillary answered the phone. She was so nice and confirmed they did have the item. Hillary said one simple thing that meant so much.. she said, `"I can't wait to see you`". It made me so excited to get ready and head out to get the drinks for my wife and I. I hopped in the car and went to the drive thru and ordered the drinks and actually met Hillary. She was just as nice in person as on the phone and made us great drinks. Seriously made us feel so happy and alive in this new world. Thanks Hillary!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Feb 10, 2019~This is my 5am wake up dream, the employees even know what my order is just by the sound of my voice, maybe there is cameras!! Oh my Double shot espresso steam 2% a little creamer and two packets of agave honey with a pup cup for Marley Wow!! this store just opened and it  was a dream come true, just go cold at 5 am to walk into the fry's one well thank you Starbucks keep up the good work
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Jun 2, 2019~I will sometimes drive here just to get nitro cold brew! I never have a long wait, the drinks I order are always right, and the drive thru and inside staff are all friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 1, 2020~Rough work week- super exhausting. Came through drive thru and asked what had the most caffeine. Friendly Eddy offered me the nitro brew with sweet cream, my new favorite!! He was right definitely wakes you up :) Thank you eddy! Great customer service
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Apr 2, 2019~Although excited to have a Starbucks in the neighborhood now and with such a friendly staff, my wish is they would understand the `"coffee lingo`" better.  Simply put when customers order a cappuccino  `"semi-dry`", that just means less milk, more foam, otherwise it's a Latte with little foam and for my personal palette drowns out the expectation of a drink well made.I've only come across one Barista at this location who knew this, but unfortunately I don't always catch him. This is not a complaint but simply an opportunity to get it right.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Sep 28, 2019~cashier today insisted on telling me ( hello ) every 2 seconds until he finally irritated me enough to placed my order as if I didn't ask for a second. No line and I still had to deal with being rushed by a rude cashier (Not to mention he still placed my order incorrectly )- thanks steve   Horrible experience &amp; I love Starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 21, 2018~I love this new location. They are always stocked. Drive thru is really quick. Inside it's very clean and the staff is very energetic. Tammy is a wonderful manager. She used to manage the Happy Valley store which was great under her management. They truly picked the right person to manage the new store. You can tell how great the management is when the staff is always upbeat and happy at their work place. Hayleigh and Alexis are truly the best! No matter how complicated our orders get they are extremely patient and happy to help. Our drinks always come out the way we want them! The energy of this location wakes you on its own before you start sipping your coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 20, 2018~Not only is this location super convenient because it's less than half a mile away from me, the staff is awesome! Alexis and Dina are my absolute favorites whenever I come through the drive thru but their entire staff always do an exceptional job and leave me with a smile :)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Feb 20, 2021~always have their mobile ordering closed. Might as well take your location off the app. Sometimes they've closed way early. and they often give my coworkers and I the completely wrong drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Feb 20, 2019~I was excited moving to the area and having a drive thru starbucks right down the street that was newer and a place I could go to remotely work. And that is what I used to do until an interaction I had on Sunday with an associate. The drive thru was very long, with the cars interfering with traffic going to others stores, so because I had my child in the car and didnt want to go through the hassle of getting her out of the car, I decided to order online and wait a little bit in my car in a nearby parking lot. After about 10 minutes, I assumed my order of coffee and a croissant would be ready since the app said 3-8 minutes. I drove over to the area which was still very packed with cars in the drive thru, patrons walking in and out, parking, etc. and saw 3 handicapped spots open next to the side entrance. I parked in the furthest one from the entrance, left my car running, literally ran inside, and saw only the coffee. So instead of waiting there I decided to run back out drop off my coffee and wait with the door open. In this time, someone else with an order also parks in the handicapped spot next to me, runs inside, and then comes back out with their coffee and leaves. The pickup area was in my sightline, so when I saw someone bring over 2 oven bags, i run back inside, only to see  someone else grab them and walk away. I'm there for less than 10 seconds when an associate says, `"Ma'am, you need to move your car.`" I responded with, `"I am just waiting for my croissant, i already got the coffee, and my child is in the car.`" His response to this was `"That's not my problem.`" I was dumbfounded that someone in customer service would respond this way. All I said was `"Seriously?!`" because if I let myself say anything else it would have caused a huge scene. I immediately left, without the croissant (which was for the kid in the first place), unable to control my anger towards this ignorant, young, completely rude, flamboyant man. IT IS YOUR PROBLEM IF THERE IS NO CONVENIENT PLACE TO PARK FOR THE CUSTOMERS WHO ORDER TO GO. It is your problem to be so fucking rude as to not come at a mother who clearly has had a bad morning with kindness and understanding. IT IS YOUR PROBLEM TO THINK THAT YOU CAN TREAT ANYONE, ESPECIALLY A CUSTOMER, WITH THAT MUCH DISRESPECT. This company lost a customer forever. I reached out to corporate only for them respond by apologizing and saying they will give me $8. That money will go to complete waste. You could have offered me $100 and I would have given it away to someone who can stand to drink that shitty coffee. I will go as far to NOT have coffee at all before drinking one more ounce of Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Feb 12, 2020~I have been to this Starbucks a few times a week and Hillary and Kyle have been so incredibly sweet, the whole staff is! Thank you everyone for always making my mornings better
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jan 16, 2020~I am here right now and it's 7am and this staff is absolutely amazing Hillary is so sweet and put a huge smile on my face! Thank you for such a great morning experience
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 4, 2019~I haven't been to a Starbucks in years and this one was great. They made a mistake in our order and very quickly fixed it. Great job! And the cinnamon role was the best I've ever had. Oh and the breakfast sandwich was good too.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jan 7, 2020~This location is the best one around! Every single employee is genuinely friendly and happy to help. My drink is always perfect without fail. And even tho they are excessively busy being the only location around with a drive thru, they are quite speedy. By far my favorite Starbucks in town
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Apr 12, 2019~Friendly staff, fairly quick service and a drive thru. Drinks are always correct. What more can you really ask for at Starbucks? The staff is very chatty sometimes, so may slow down the drive thru. But I'm not complaining; I love that they are friendly and conversational.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Dec 28, 2018~I love Starbucks just as much as the next girl, but this location is the worst. Consistently have had to have drinks remade, due to them making them incorrectly or not filling the cup. I never have this problem at other Starbucks and prefer the one on Anthem Way, unfortunately this one is more convenient for me. I was very excited to see a drive thru Starbucks so close to home, but have been consistently let down at this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3.7~(302 reviews)~Update 9-14-24Weekends Are Now Open!Sat &amp; Sun 5:30am-5pmThis is great considering most EOS gym people and nursing schools need a place to grab their coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3.7~(3 reviews)~They are closed on weekends. They just opened EOS Fitness on the second floor of Zipps. This place is very cozy, a great place to unwind, using your laptop and seeing people from the nursing schools, office workers, health and law professionals. I've met with a friend here and it's a great place to chat. It does get busy in the morning. Friendly staff.  Lots of places nearby to grab food too. Easy access to light rail exiting Thomas &amp; Central.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Sep 14, 2024~This is my 2nd trip to this Starbucks in the past week.  3120 North Central Avenue, Phoenix Midtown.  The recipes are wrong.  Earlier, I ordered a Brown sugar oat milk latte.  I got something similar to an iced coffee with oat milk poured on it.  Today I ordered a London Fog iced latte.  What I got was 2% milk with ice poured into it.  Very weak.  I took it back to my office.....boiled up a cup of Earl Grey, cooled it and added it to the latte to try and save it.  This is the last time to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Dec 14, 2023~Generally the staff is courteous and the orders are prepared as requested.  The issue however is that parking is difficult with so many of the EOS gym customers using the same parking lot as Starbucks and it's often not worth the hassle trying to navigate the already congestion lot.The parking lot is clearly posted prohibiting gym customers from parking there but the signs are ignored and apparently not enforced by property management as gym customers blatantly park and walk straight to the gym without fear of being ticketed or towed.Sad that a great location has been hampered by neighboring businesses.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Sep 26, 2024~This is my go to Starbucks it's close to my work usually no issues. But yesterday and today Starbucks has dropped the ball I get my usual iced hazelnut oat milk shaken espresso 5 pumps hazelnut and 1 pump brown sugar never had issues until yesterday and today. When I received my drink it was bland no syrups added when I went back to the drive through they told me they started doing half pumps instead of the full and on the app I had to double it and get charged double that's crazy that they are doing this at this location scamming people to be charged more in the app hopefully this is not company wide
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Sep 17, 2024~I must say this Starbucks made the best Frappuccino I ever had. The staff was very friendly and polite. The place was spotless. I was very pleased with my visit to Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~1~Jun 28, 2024~I was here for the first time yesterday, and my service was impeccable. I came at a rather busy time and I was in and out of the drive thru so fast! Emma took my order and was so kind. Her smile made my day! Thank you, Emma!!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~3~Nov 26, 2023~The service during my visit was good.  The barista was friendly. The only note is that the 2 drinks that I bought showed separation.  It seems that there are curds of milk. The shaken espresso was fine flavor wise whereas the paradise drink tasted awful. I called to let them know which the barista try to offer the best solution.  2 stars for the drinks. 4 for service.
Phoenix, AZ 85012~5~Sep 24, 2024~This Starbucks is seriously the bomb. Whether I choose a pick up mobile order or go through the drive through they are always quick and friendly! The nice tall man who works drive thru Tuesday-Thursday around 7 am is always so pleasant and fast!
Phoenix, AZ 85012~2~Apr 2, 2024~If I go in the am no issue ever every time I go in the afternoon attitude wrong order poor service I can almost count on it I waited 12 minutes in the drive through with one car in front of me I pull out to just walk in cuz that's insane 12 minutes  in a drive through on something I preordered I get in it's cold as Ice I ask for it to be remade and she proceeds to take the food I just put in my mouth on back into the toaster  I then say please remake it she rolls her eyes I'm like just give me my money back I go to get my phone and I come back in girls complaining about me getting a refund just terrible employees the entire group should call the health dept on these fools
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~~This morning I went to Starbucks on 28th St &amp; Indian School Rd. I ordered my $6.84 Chia Tea Latte, I ordered it with 1/2 Soy Milk and 1/2 Coconut Milk. 1. employee put Oatmilk in Lieu of Soymilk. 2. i informed the young man that it is suppose to be 1/2 Soy and 1/2 Coconut milk, just pour both in the tin steaming cup and heat, then just pour it in cup with the Chia. 3. Male employee proceeds to inform me he doesn't do it that way, WTF, I am the customer paying for a $6.84 drink and it is only going to get don't the way the employee wants to do it. UGH!!!!***Hey you social media brain male employee , I want my Drink the way I get it `"My Way`"***I threw the $6.84 drink into the trash and left, that was expensive. I drove to another Starbucks and ordered my $6.84 Chia Tea Latte and paid again...ugh! I watched the guy make my Latte and saw him try to scrape the foam off the top, WTF, I said Stop and do not do that, just pour the milk mixture into the cup.***Hey you social media brain employees, Read The Label and make the Drinks as the Label Says!!!***I am Done with Starbucks!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~~SB on the corner of 24th st and Indian School. The Los Olivos park is just up the street. There is a roomy seating area with a private meeting room. A nice, large patio is also on the street side.Staff is very busy maintaining excellent courtesy, professionalism and speed completing orders.Above avg. SB with drive thru.Recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~~The culture at this Starbucks is abysmal. The majority of the employees are exceptionally rude. I've gone to this location about three times a week for the past year because it's convenient and I tolerate the attitudes of the employees because of that convenience. Unfortunately for me, the benefits of convenience no longer outweigh the irritation of consistently being treated rudely. You can feel the tension and agitation from the employees when you simply ask for a straw. The employees frequently get behind and lose orders, which isn't a big deal, but the way they take out their stress and frustration on the guest is. I'm not one to complain. I've been in hospitality for the majority of my career and completely understand being busy/how stressful guest facing interactions can be. I would NEVER treat a guest the way that they treat you here. At this point, it's on the management team for cultivating this hostile environment and allowing it to continue every day.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 25, 2024~Don't go here- took 35 minutes to get one grande hot drink. 3 team members just standing around looking lost.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Aug 10, 2021~Don't go here, I've been to mini Starbucks and never seen such a filthy Starbucks. The bathrooms were disgusting and everything else the service was terrible.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 19, 2024~Negative stars for sure. The customer service is HORRIBLE. We waited 30 minutes for 2 waters and a small  tea. And the environment is dirty. The staff was SO RUDE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Nov 3, 2023~Twice at different days and times tried to order through the drive thru but had the sign blocking it saying sorry the drive thru is closed today! Now I'm here today sitting in lobby and it's packed but an employee comes around saying `"sorry we are closing our lobby in 15 minutes`". Seems like they make their own hours/rules than what is posted. Very inconvenient for those of us that have planned to do work/study for a few hours while enjoying coffee and snacks. Won't be coming to this location again due to the inconveniences.ALSO - the bathrooms were DISGUSTING! Save yourself the headache and just go to SIP or another location.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Apr 29, 2023~Wait for 15 minutes and ask them where is my drink and they hang and talk for awhile and I  ask again they say we will making it right at the they did not make and give me my refund after 25 minutes waiting with no drink  Starbucks at 59th Avenue and Dunlap
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 18, 2023~This starbucks is extremely slow and horrible service. I would order my drink 15-20 MINUTES ahead so by the time i would get there it would be ready but it would never be ready and there would be a whole line of people in front of me waiting for their orders. Most of the time i would have to leave my order because it wasn't ready in 25 minutes!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Aug 3, 2022~Giving it 5 stars for my experience. Came in this morning (October 13th, 2020) around 9:30am. No wait in the drive thru, great customer service while ordering. They got the order perfect. Person at drive thru window was very calm and respectful , just a great mood overall! Thanks!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~~I usually stop at this Starbucks when I'm in the area. They have a drive thru. They also have a huge area to sit inside. They even have 3 personal sofas. They even have a room to have meetings in and you can close the door. I never saw this at any other Starbucks. They have different drinks from coffee to teas to frappacinos. My favorite is the caramel frappacino &amp; the iced white chocolate mocha is good. Also my favorite is the cheese danish. You can download the app and get points when you buy from Starbucks. Once you get 125 points you get a free drink/food item. Also there's special offers when your a Starbucks member. You also get a free birthday drink or food. Also you can order on your phone and it will be ready by the time you get to the store to pick it up, it's called mobile order. I love this feature so I don't wait forever in line and I'm in a rush.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~What happens when you're working from home and a blackout happens causing your much needed wifi to go out? You can either stop working until the electricity returns or go to your nearest, conveniently located Starbucks to resume your work. And that's exactly what I did today!Generally speaking, I always have a pleasant experience with any Starbucks I go to. However, the one located on 28th St and Indian School might be my favorite location. It has the perfect setup for a work/study environment. They have areas with outlets that are perfect for laptop carriers such as myself and a large conference room for any group of people that require privacy.I quickly got my caramel iced coffee and got right back into work. Starbucks usually has a quiet surrounding and as such, I was able to work without any outside distractions. And being that I am a Starbucks Rewards member, I was able to get my refill and finish the rest of my work before I went home. Whether it be a quick drive-thru stop to grab coffee or a multi-hour stay to finish up on tasks, this Starbucks is perfect for a visit!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~~Mobile ordered... no greeting from anyone. Half of order wasn't ready with the other half. Had to ask... walk up orders that came in after mine were fulfilled before mine. Disappointed today.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Mar 5, 2018~This is one of my favorite Starbucks because it has a small conference room available to reserve. They used to require you buy a $50 gift card to reserve it but it's free now (at least I didn't have to pay the last two times). Today I used the app to order ahead... London Fog Tea Latte w/ only 2 pumps vanilla (instead of 5). It's a nice coffee alternative. Good for a cold morning.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 14, 2020~It takes a lot for me to write a negative review. I have been a loyal Starbucks customer for nearly 20 years. I get a drink from a Starbucks on average six times a week so I understand, by number of visits alone, I am going to have bad service days. However, THIS location can not put two consecutive decent experiences together in a row. The amount of employees standing around NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGING customers is unacceptable. My mobile order is nearly never ready on time. I use this location once a week out of geographic convenience. Due to lack of service I now go out of my way to find another location.Once I ordered (and paid for) a Venti drink and was given a grande. I went to the counter to show the employee the mistake and the manager asked me if I wanted them to remake one in a venti. Being that I paid for a venti, yes please... was that really your question?I had one good experience here and it was in the drive thru. I was so grateful I took the time to tell the employee how much I appreciated her. This is not a negative review of Starbucks, it is a negative review of THIS location.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Nov 17, 2019~May as well not sell breakfast sandwiches because they're always out of them. Manager needs to do a better job with inventory and ordering.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Feb 25, 2019~This location is a straight dumpster fire. It doesn't matter what time of the day you come, if you order ahead you will wait 10+ minutes for your order past the pick up time. The staff is straight up frazzled every day and have no customer service what so ever.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Feb 1, 2023~It was a good Starbucks visit. My drink was made properly and the service was friendly. Can't ask for much more than that. Starbucks is overpriced for what you get compared to other coffee shops though. I rather give my money locally. Starbucks is quick and easy so sometimes I'm willing to spend more to get what I need/want.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jan 24, 2023~taylor at the drive through was delightful and hilarious. i appreciate the early morning light heartedness :)
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Nov 19, 2022~I was so disappointed with my service :(I walked in &amp; was greeted by no one. However, when the next customers walked in behind me, everyone greeted them with excitement! They got my banana bread ready right away; however, my drink took about 10 minutes. They kept asking me if I had a mobile order (even though I had just placed my order at the counter). I felt very neglected and sad that no one seemed to care I was there. I'm not one to complain, but I am used to way more welcoming service from Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 22, 2020~I absolutely love this Starbucks! Super convenient and on my way to Downtown Phoenix and the 51 freeway - CHECKDrive thru - CHECKVERY friendly employees - CHECK Fast service (even when they have a long line) - CHECKThey had my mango dragonfruit refresher IN STOCK today - CHECK CHECK CHECK (Every location has been out for WEEKS now and this pregnant momma has been CRAVING it!)All in all, this Starbucks has been such a dream to pop in and out of the drive thru on my way to meetings, etc. I usually pass it when headed downtown or to the 51 freeway and it is perfectly situated on the north side of Indian School and easy to get in and out of. I'll see you again soon!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~I'm giving a review not for the Starbucks location, but for specifically an employee. I'm not sure how to spell her name exactly- but her name is Sydney. Her customer service is phenomenal, and you can tell she has pride in herself and knows her regulars! I usually don't go to Starbucks, but since I live near here I may as well stop In time to time hoping Sydney is working. Really a beautiful person... this Starbucks should feel lucky to have this employee! (Side note: I'm not sure who made the drinks because I ran to the restroom, but the drinks I received were great. The location was also clean and had good music.)
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~~I don't understand why they are still closing their lounge completely- drive thru only. We are past covid. Why is this still happening? Corporate might be interested in knowing
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~~Super rude staff, I asked for 12 drinks for a mobile order to be put in bags for ease of carrying on my own and they were so inconvenienced by it. Said thank you to the person who brought them out and she stayed quiet and just glared. Don't pick a customer service based job then?
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 4, 2021~I just came in for my Saturday morning coffee and had the best experience with this crew, they were amazing! The lady at the register was also super sweet:) 100% recommend this location!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Feb 26, 2023~I personally like this Starbucks because of the outdoor patio and small study room. I don't have much time throughout my day to stay and observe the atmosphere of the place. But I do see a lot of people studying and meeting with others as I'm walking in to get my order. I've learned to use mobile order for places like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts simply because I hate waiting. I've had so many items on the menu, it's insane! My fav is a Iced Latte with one pump of Vanilla, Soy Milk and Sugar Packet. Great service every single time. Even during their rush hour they still provide fast service. I have so many different ways of saving money by ordering certain ways lol so if you like my review, hit that follow button.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Sep 29, 2021~This unfortunately has to be worst Starbucks in Phoenix!! Great location but the same unfriendly girl Elmada works the window greeting you with WHAT CAN I GET YOU? No hi no update never a smile she takes at least 5 minutes per car and it's not talking to them it's off doing who knows what?! When I asked her why I waited 40 minutes she was mad and said uhh we're in a rush duh?!She claims she works window and counter?? Maybe understaffed?? This Starbucks is super close to my sons school unfortunately it's horrible service every time!! Please get more help or someone more friendly and fast to work window!!Oh the coffee still taste great :-)
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 28, 2022~The only thing consistent about this location is that 9/10 there will be an issue. However, THIS was a first. I ordered a mocha and was told they were out of mocha. HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF MOCHA?!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 1, 2018~Tried this location again today and was not disappointed! Probably the best interaction I've ever had at a Starbucks. Ashton is awesome! Decided to try something new - the Toasted Vanilla Oatmilk Espresso - SO GOOD!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 14, 2020~This location always has either one of two things: a very long wait, or they are closed way ahead of their scheduled closing time. I tried last Saturday, they closed 15 minutes early. I tried Wednesday evening, their `"computers were down`" at 7:30pm. This evening, cones in the drive thru again, at 7:30pm. Just change your hours if no one wants to stay until 8pm.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Nov 26, 2022~Love coming through the drive way here. Hannah is kind and efficient!!! I will add time to my trip to stop here because they are quick and make good drinks!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 9, 2022~Sam at this location is a gem and offered excellent customer service *chefs kiss*! The drink was wonderfully made and was suggested by Sam. The interior was clean and the music choice was great. Would come here again.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Mar 6, 2021~I really like this Starbucks. Instead of the understaffing problem you find at some other Starbucks locations, this Starbucks is almost always fully staffed, at least whenever I go, likely the result of a higher than normal sales volume given its central location. No pun intended. This means a higher service delivery to customers and great response time to go with it.To give you an idea, only a mere few weeks after the `"Toasted coconut cold brew`" special was released for the summer, this location ran out, even of backstock volume for the entire season. THAT'S how busy this place is! (Fear not by the way, the baristas have fantastic recommendations for when they're out of stock on a flavor, again, they REALLY ensure customer satisfaction big time at this particular Starbucks).The drinks I order vary, but again, I've never been dissatisfied. The number of AC power outlets here, good god there's plenty go with! So it's great for those of us working professionals that need a place other than home and work to study or do other stuff.Not to mention the separate conference room that you can rent out or chill in when it's not reserved.Internet is fast. Central Phoenix is one of the few places that offers fiber internet, and while their wireless router doesn't support 1000 Mbps per connection, I'll take its existing 150-300 Mbps that I currently get there, it sure as hell beats the under-50 Mbps connections I've seen in other parts of metropolitan Phoenix (I'm looking at you, Scottsdale and Mesa...)For those of you that like to work outside but hate the heat, fear not! There are misters that mist the entire patio area of the Starbucks.Also, there is a drive thru at this location, so for those of you on the go, you have that option here :)Only negative I can give this place, and isn't really specifically for the business itself, is the shopping center it's in. The Starbucks shares the same parking lot as a very busy Sprouts store, so when double ad Wednesday strikes at the nearby Sprouts, parking gets slammed at Starbucks fast. Since the parking spots at Starbucks aren't labeled `"Starbucks customer only`", you end up having Sprouts customers parking nearby which vampire-drains the Starbucks. Bad Sprouts shoppers...
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~This is my usual Starbucks and I fruequent it almost every day. I'll place a mobile order when I leave my workout class and then pull into the Starbucks a few minutes later. My order is always ready and waiting.They have plenty of seating including a large patio area. The drive thru line is always long in the morning but moves quickly.This is one of the few Starbucks to have a meeting room. It seats 8 and can be reserved.I love the staff at this location and I'm happy that it's my closest Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~I had an AMAZING experience here!!!! That was my FAVORITE worker!!!! Oven was off...but.... she gave me a second for FREEE overall 10/10 expirence
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~We have been in a lot of Starbucks locations all over. This particular one has a very unique store layout as it is on a corner and is in an L inside. Last night when we were here we wondered what the building was prior to becoming a Starbucks. Today we are in again. It is a very comfortable environment with lots of parking. Usually we bring our own cups but had left them at home today. So we asked for our lattes in cups for here.  Coffee was excellent.  Comfortable chairs too.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Apr 22, 2017~Terrible service! Closed early at 5 and made people in line back up through drive through because they closed at 5 even though we were in line before 5. And they placed cones behind the last car in line and so they had to come remove the cones so we could back out. Lady was very rude about not taking the last people in line.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 16, 2022~Best location ever!!! Definitely going back there!! The beautiful female that was at the window was supper nice ( I think her name is Liz?), she should get a raise fr cause I wasn't a huge Starbucks fan but starting today that changed
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jul 2, 2014~I tried to surprise my hubby who serves for the Marine Corps for his 245th marine birthday and asked if they could put on the cup `"happy 245th birthday Marine`" &amp; instead `"I got `"happy birthday Mari`" &amp; the 245 was on top of that? Then I asked for a sharpie so I can do it myself, no sharpies, fine. So I asked if they could fix the error and instead the girl just grabbed a piece of paper and wrote `"Marine`" on it. What kind of service is that??? It's 11am and whoever was on that shit did a horrible job. Not even a smile, like if they were just wanting to get people in and out.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Sep 4, 2022~I usually don't write reviews but this was a MUST. Do NOT come here. Besides the service being very bad the barista did not know how to make anything. My `"frap`" had NO FLAVOR and I told the cashier that I wasn't satisfied with it. And she was like okay. and ? She had a rude attitude and didn't try anything to make the situation right. Her name was Jesse. And the barista had pink hair. I told her to remake it. And the barista mixed the same coffee. I wouldn't recommend coming here. It ruined my date.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Aug 31, 2022~It's fine. A Starbucks for sure. But it is always constantly closed without notice. It's been a week now of them not being open for what I can assume is covid related.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Nov 10, 2020~Great drink.  Ordered my daily frap.  The line in the drive thru was a little long.  Took a while...about 10-15 minutes...but, you know, Starbucks time doesn't count  Thanks again for the chocolate rich smile!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Mar 4, 2020~Most of the employees here need to learn to have a sense of urgency. Assuming customers just want to get their coffee and get out and start their day... Wait times here are ridiculous whether it be the drive-thru, mobile order, or in store. They seem lost...maybe a lack of leadership? Who knows but something needs to change. Drinks are okay, no real complaint there. Service is meh though. There is this one person at the drive-thru, he always sounds like he does not want to be there and comes off quite rude. Hopefully their manager sees this.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~~This location maybe gets my drink order correct half the time. This morning I am SO annoyed. I asked for a hot almond milk latte with NO FOAM. When I get to the office what do I get? Foam of course in my coffee. And the coffe for a grande isn't even filled. Like `"foam`" takes an inch and a half of space in a grande hot coffee....so annoyed.  I scooped out the foam and you can see how full my coffee is and the foam I didn't want.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~I don't know how many ways I can say that I LOVE this Starbucks! It's spacious, it has an enclosed meeting space available for reserve use. Ample table space for groups to study or chat together. The ambiance is classic Starbucks. One of the bonuses is the entire staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming....I love just being able to come in read my book, chat with those lounging, while enjoying my favorite Starbucks treats!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~~This is the slowest Starbucks in Arizona. I'm mean you sit in line for a minimum of 20mins before getting to the window to pay. And not even a `"I'm sorry we're so damn slow`".
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 31, 2018~No matter what do the drive thru. By far the slowest Starbucks I've ever been to. It can take 20 minutes plus on a mobile order. They have one person making drinks for walk ins and mobile orders. Meanwhile they have 6 people helping the drive thru. You would think during COVID times they wouldn't want 15 people waiting inside for drinks that are taking 20 minutes. Nice staff but learn to allocate people better.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Jan 6, 2017~Slow. It would be faster to buy a coffee machine and make your own. The barista at this Starbucks can only make one drink at a time, which means even when it's slow it can take anywhere from 10+ minutes to get a drink. If the coffee was better for it being slow, that might have made a difference but it's low quality Starbucks compared to other stores. They also don't consistently have people at the cashier, so you may as well go through the drive through, which is sad for the environment and the quality of service.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Nov 7, 2020~Large interior and lots of parking at this Starbucks location.There are several Starbucks within a few miles of this one, almost one on every corner. Almost like Walgreens. The efficiency of the baristas, who seem to enjoy their jobs, and a good sized cabinet of snacks, along with the usual line up of drinks keep me coming here when I'm in this area.What's unique about this Starbucks location, though, is this almost separate room, like a reading or gaming room. Could be used for a small get together area. I also like all the different configurations of seating options here.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Sep 22, 2020~Very popular location, and this one is perfectly situated between my Daughter's place and My Casa in Arcadia, so we meet early on occasion for a brew, and it's becoming that `"special place`" for us. Because of that fact, I'll overlook the old, run down furniture (could use a décor upgrade), but overall, the people working here are friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.There is not a big selection of gifts, trinkets and stuff, which doesn't bother me in the least, but it's nice to have a few things, just in case I have an impulse to buy something for someone who needs a big mug, or a large bag o' coffee beans!The drive through lane seems to be the biggest down side to this particular location, for it winds out into the parking aisle of the lot that serves Sprouts Market and a dozen other small businesses. This usually doesn't seem to bother the Starbucks customers, because we have one thing on the brain...COFFEE!! However, for others using the parking lot, it can be a snarl. The window service has always been fast, in my experience, so cars move quickly, and I assume that the drivers using the drive-through lane have it figured out as to what they want, and are just as efficient in ordering as the coffee attendees are at taking orders and filling them.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 10, 2020~I've never gotten out of here in under 15 minutes- and that's considering I'm only ordering ONE DRINK with no customization. No matter if I've done drive thru, mobile order or going into the store...it's gonna be a looooong wait. Also, this place closes super early, I think like 8:00pm!  Skip this location if at all possible.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Nov 27, 2015~Closest Starbucks to my house so I'm always there, sometimes the line gets long but they're always very sweet and apologetic (even tho it's not their fault I don't understand why people on here are complaining, I suggest they fulfill their caffeine needs somewhere else, very Karen energy of y'all to blame the staff for STARBUCKS being popular) I've also gotten my drink for free multiple times when it's too busy so thank y'all for that I appreciate it.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Dec 4, 2015~Literally the slowest Starbucks in the entire valley... there is no reason to sit in drive thru for over 10 minutes. Go to literally any other location if you are in any kind of a time schedule... they move at a snails pace and most of the times I've made an order, it has been incorrect the first time and I have to reiterate what I ordered. I will say they are at least nice when you finally make it to the window.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~~My go to Starbucks &amp; usually make great drinks, except today there was an unfriendly blonde at the cash register who seemed miserable at 8am- definitely off putting. I ordered the new oat milk drink &amp; got about 3 inches of foam- I am not paying $7 for foam. Might take a break from going to Starbucks all together.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~~The staff at this location while friendly always seems lost and overwhelmed.  Never once have I had an order that's been correct.  And every time I go to pick up a mobile order, I have to regularly remind them that there's other parts of the order they didn't give me.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~~I usually come to this location but the drive thru. This time I saw a very long line and I decided to get down. Make mistake! They cater faster to the drive thru customers! I waited and waited! Watched people get a drink they orders way after. Drive thru on the future!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Mar 11, 2021~Went to Starbucks to get me a white chocolate mocha. When I got home I noticed, in the medium cup I got, that it was only half full. Paid 5 dollars for a small coffee in a medium cup. I always get Starbucks but this is a rip off I mean I don't like to complain but hey I guess I am right but since I'm at it yeah never mind I'll make it easy and just go to Dutch bros. problem solved. Thanks Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 30, 2020~Consistently gives me the wrong order both food and drink.  Latest occasion was for several drinks,  croissant ,  choc croissant and cookie.  Arrive home and found I've rec'd cake pops .  Drive back and the barista was completely unapologetic that a 10 minute trip has now take 40 mins of my day.  Arrived, explained the wrong order and she simply said drive around,  so waited in line again,  pulled up and she took my bag back and said here's your croissant. Drinks were incorrectly made,  good thing we don't have a dairy allergy because the soy drink was made with milk.  This is probably the 10th error in a couple months each time adding to the poor customer experience.  Additionally, trying to order without getting bees in your car is another challenge as there must be a nest somewhere near the speaker.  Has been happening for a while as well.  Avoid this location ,  poor experience and customer service lacking.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jul 14, 2016~The girl that worked the morning drive-thru today needs to know she's appreciated. It's people like her that restores my confidence in humanity these days, while it seems that everyone else has lost their minds these days. This might sound silly over a simple coffee order, her words went along way for a very bad start to my day.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 20, 2017~Obviously this wasn't built a Starbucks. It's more spacious than your average 'bucks, and has a cool little game room tucked away with a table to seat 8 or so. A few gents were playing chess while we were there.Lots and lots of seating is available, although lots of it is taken by people working away on their computers. The customer service is excellent.I had my first Fizzio (root beer). It was unexpectedly really good! Has a tinge of ginger in it, and with whipped cream on top it has a creamy aftertaste. I'm not a huge fan of cold coffee, so this might become my go-to cold drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 29, 2021~some of the best customer service I've ever had! Cassandra was the sweetest!! It says I have to write more but that's all I can say lol!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 20, 2021~Worst Baristas EVER! Never Returning To This Location. They Missed Up My Order &amp; They NEVER asked to fix my order.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jul 3, 2014~Heather. You can't give a customer a drink that is dripping off the sides: You need to be more conscious  of the faces you make when we tell you that we rent taking a drink that is dripping. Got to get a little more training sis!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~~The girl in the drive through is passive aggressive and rude. Waited 10mins in drive through for a hot tea.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~~Arrived this morning at 9 AM and ordered classic coffee cake and a butter croissant. They did not have any more classic coffee cake thought but had some frozen as most of Starbucks food comes in frozen and they thought out and then just reheat it for you. Had to wait 10 to 15 minutes in the drive-through line and the coffee cake still came out cold. I don't know how these employees are able to work at a Starbucks and can't even get a coffee cake heated up. We have ordered coffee cake that has been frozen before and have never had an issue. It is so disappointing that they can't even get your food items done correctly even after making you wait 10 to 15 minutes in the drive-through line!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~Nice place to meet up for a working session.  We got to use the conference room.  My friend and I were there for at least 3 hours, we did not know.  We got a lot of work done and enjoyed the environment.  We are meeting up with round #2 soon!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 13, 2018~This Starbucks is AWESOME. I love working here because they're so friendly and they often bring around samples of different types of coffee. Every single employee I've ever encountered at this location is stoked to be there and it shows in the way they treat their customers. They work really hard to ensure that every order is completed correctly, and for one of the busiest locations is by far one of the fastest. Props to whoever does the hiring here
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Aug 21, 2018~I understand they were busy this morning but when i pay for a Trenta Iced coffee, i expect to pay for coffee and not all ice. I placed my order through the mobile app and i had to wait for it. I saw her make my drink and she poured the iced coffee into my cup that was left in the jug then poured all this ice into my cup. The cup was over 85 percent filled with ice and very little coffee. This shop is my favorite one to go to when i visit Phoenix. I may have to choose another location with the service i got this morning. A little advice is that when someone orders a iced drink, don't over use the ice to make it look like the cup is full just to get the drink out. Make it right the first time so we don't have to complain about it.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Mar 11, 2016~I stop at this location often whenever in Phoenix. It is unfortunate because this location has the specialty brews and yet it's service is adequate at best. I guess the Starbucks way in terms of Customer Service is optional at this location...I don't get it.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 27, 2019~Great drive thru experience, Henry is very passionate about his job and exemplified great customer service! Will definitely be returning soon!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 3, 2018~This has got to be the best Starbucks I go to, hands down. I pass this location on my morning commute to work. I have to be at work by 8 am and there have been times where I will pull into the drive-thru, with cars stretched out to the street (close to 10 or more cars), at 7:50 (I know, risk-taker!), and I will still get my coffee and be at work with time to spare! Grant it, my work is only about 5 miles from this Starbucks, but the speed of their service is commendable, every single time. On top of that, they are extremely friendly and accommodating. One morning, they accidentally overcharged my card for the wrong order. When I told them it was wrong, they refunded the amount and comped my actual drink order, so I got a cup of free coffee that day. The whole misunderstanding took all of 2 minutes to correct. No arguing. No confusion. Just great customer service. The employees here are definitely on their A-game every day. They are hella quick, precise, and consistent. I highly recommend this location, especially if you like your service FAST. One thing I might mention is that the parking lot is a tad small and it can be a pain to park when the lot is highly busy. I rarely go inside the store though so it's not a huge problem for me.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Apr 25, 2016~11 minutes for a mobile order! Basic Grande latte.  Ridiculous,  they make the drive thru orders first to keep the cars flowing and less wait time in the drive. Gotta make their numbers of wait time low, so they delay mobiles.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Apr 16, 2016~Love coming here to this Starbucks. Alot of chairs to sit with Wi-Fi, and sip away. Good parking too.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Dec 30, 2015~The refresher and the butterscotch latte is my favorite, sometimes a simple drink with two orders can always be messed up or not done right due to the horrible communication between the back and the front line. Overall nothing beats Starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~~Wow marginal service, the restroom is dirty,  table had crumbs on it and the trash can full. Hubby said the coffee was good though.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~~I am giving them two stars not because of the coffee. I enjoyed their coffee, there are some small coffee shops that I prefer, but whenever I go to Starbucks I know I'm going to get a nice hearty cup. They sent me a coupon to have a free breakfast this morning. So I had a sausage, egg, cheese English muffin. I don't often eat these but from time to time I will break down and get one from McDonald's. The cost of the Starbucks McMuffin is much higher then the McDonals and it is nowhere near as tasty. They do not have food offering as good as their coffee, in my opinion
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~5 stars just for the awesome muzak station they use! There's so many places to sit and study our work with a laptop. The baristas are way nice and the cold brew is great! I also love the conference room they have set up for study groups. I wouldn't ever be using it, but it's awesome to see how well they cater to students.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Nov 21, 2017~The Starbucks to come to, it's large with lots of seating indoor and outdoor and even has a meeting room that you can reserve by buying at least $50 in gift cards.I take away a couple stars and am motivated to post because one of the baristas is SLAMMING equipment down or slamming shut the ice cover or something, WHAM!!!, OVER and OVER, it is SO LOUD, very startling when I'm trying to get some work done.As I'm heading out (one WHAM!! too many) one customer is asking the same barista, `"Excuse me, I've been standing here for a long time. Is my drink ready? [Is shown drink on counter] Why didn't you call my name?!`" Barista said, `"I called out the drink!`" smh .. If the name was asked for, call out the name! Customers listen only for their name if they're asked their name!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 20, 2016~Confused by so many bad reviews on this location.I go to this Starbucks almost daily and usually at peak times too and the line always moves quickly! The line is incredibly long at times but that's not at the fault of this location or it's employees. I always enjoy getting my coffee from here. I have also used mobile order a few times and it is super fast. Thank you to the employees who work here!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Jul 29, 2015~Probably the best interior of a Starbucks I've ever seen. It's stylish, huge, had a conference room you can rent out that seats 6. Totally cool. But I see 5 people behind the counter and only 1 of them making drinks when there's a line over flowing the drive through and 5 people inside waiting for drinks (not even at the register, already paid and waiting). Needless to say the wait time between the register and having a drink in my hand was significantly longer than usual for a Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 27, 2015~The service at this Starbucks is so Great! Debbie and Henry went way above and beyond to not only make us feel so welcome, they made our drinks to perfection. I love the character of the building and how they preserved the history of the property by retrofitting the existing architecture.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Sep 27, 2020~Starbucks is across the street from my house and I'm officially a happy camper!   So glad to have a business other than title loans on this corner.   The remodeling is fantastic, the place is spacious and airy with lots of light.  Great seating indoors and outside as well.  Drive through is convenient and easy to access.  Hours are great - open until 10 pm.   We went a few days after the Grand Opening.  The place was busy but not overwhelming.  The staff were friendly and kept the line moving well.  They're still working on getting their product and quantities adjusted to the right amount, but I'm sure it will all come together soon! Look forward to heading to Starbucks and stopping by Sprouts on a morning walk.  So convenient!   Welcome to the neighborhood, Starbucks!  Happy to have you here!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jul 12, 2017~Hasn't happened to me in a while. I was almost delighted!For years I avoided Starbucks because I just drink black coffee: Plain old black coffee. And for years Starbucks had the worst black coffee in the biz. It was burned-tasting, probably over-roasted in some effort to cut the sweetness of the tons of sugar most people want in their coffee confections. So when I'd go to Starbucks and they'd cheerily ask `"what can I get started for you?`" I'd just say `"medium coffee, black`" and usually they couldn't understand. Then I got attitude. I got sick of it. I stayed away in droves.But then they came out with that Pikes Place© branded stuff (everything needs to have a brand. Intellectual capital and all that) and it was ok and they stopped giving me attitude when I'd order it. Maybe Starbucks could be a coffee destination for me once again.So it was with some delight that my order at the drive-thru speaker was greeted with a pause and soft-voiced incredulity. When I rolled up to the window, $2.50 in hand, I beheld the almost-offended haughty visage of a tattooed coffee artisan, who handed me a cup almost without making eye contact. `"Two-eleven`" he said, flatly. I handed him the money and said `"keep it`", trying to smooth over the poor dear's rankled nerves. But an artist, once offended, can't be assuaged with a mere tuppence. He said nothing and retreated to his lair behind the window, obviously there to ponder the banality of the philistine he had just encountered. And I was delighted. Because I can now safely go back to my previous prejudices regarding Starbucks. Mission Accomplished!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Apr 16, 2016~This review is solely on the drive through. Out of all the starbucks I've been through this one on 28th st and Indian school hands-down was the most unpleasant experience I've had. From dropping change to `"we'll deal with you in a little`" and even a unpleasant release a breath basically stating that she didn't want to add on cheese danish to my order was not very welcoming that being said. I will not return to the Starbucks and/or do not recommend it to anyone.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~Haven't I reviewed this location before?Okay, they open early and stay open fairly late (need to cram study for an upcoming exam?) They have AMPLE patio seating (with free wifi) and, they are the only SBs I know with a private 'conference room.' There is plenty of parking available, plus there is a Sprouts nearby along with my decade long favorite public laundromat.Local parents must feel this is a 'safe place' because I have noticed some 'regulars' kids hanging out, as though awaiting their 'swap/pick-up.' (THAT is a good thing.)They are pet friendly (most SBs are) and I have seen some service animals that are regulars.All the staff is great, pleasant and courteous, there are a few who are my favorites.Well, I think I hit the high points.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~I love this Starbucks, have been coming here almost daily (M-F) for years. Great location, and the building is beautiful, it was a bank when it was first built (the vault is used for storage!). The inside is big and comfortable, and the covered patio is great when the weather is nice. It also has a drive thru. The very best thing about this Starbucks is the service.  All the baristas are very friendly and always have a smile on their faces, even when they're busy. Always get my order right. They really seem to go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~~This is the SLOWEST Starbucks ever. I've tried every way of ordering a drink, from going inside, sitting in the drive thru or ordering on the app. Every way take more than 10 minutes. It's actually pretty ridiculous!!! Most of the employees are very nice but you would think that with this many reviews about the location being so slow they would find a way to fix it. Hopefully something changes!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 21, 2014~This Starbucks has amazing seating, it's broken up into three main rooms and one can even be reserved. Plus this one has two side of the building as a patio. Very clean and the bathrooms are tidy. This Starbucks is now one of my favorites.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~Dec 17, 2019~Honestly this Sbux consistently has the slowest service of any sbux I've been to. Drive through is slow, counter is slow. From now on I'll mobile order in the parking lot, as that seems to be the best way to get in and out quickly. I'll keep coming here because it's close but holy jeez it's slow!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Mar 10, 2020~Good service very respectable any other coffee place doesnt meet there service only thing i dont like is the line but thats to be expected
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Feb 13, 2018~I'm sure the coffee is decent but the drive through hinders the ability of flowing traffic in the parking lot every time I visit the shopping plaza. I get that people are simply to lazy to park their car and walk in but there is no need to create a bottleneck simply because you put your wants before having common courtesy of other people.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Aug 6, 2019~Do not come to this Starbucks, a guy named Jarred who is the store manager is extremely rude and left a bad taste in my mouth about Starbucks.  The store is always messy and the service is HORRIBLE. Make sure you drive through or you'll be waiting 15 minutes to be a cold latte. Jared and this workers are always gossiping loudly behind the counter. There are several other Starbucks in this area. Avoid this one!! **** update****Still takes 15 minutes to get a drink
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 2, 2018~Do not come to this Starbucks, a guy named Jarred who is the store manager is extremely rude and left a bad taste in my mouth about Starbucks.

Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 16, 2019~The baristas who work here are all AWESOME. It doesn't matter how busy they are, and believe it when I say they are CRAZY busy, we're always treated as though we're the only ones there. The entire staff has an amazing attitude. Thank you times a ZILLION!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 7, 2016~Getting work done at 2 ...3 ...4 a.m keeping residents up all the time ... this is just the most recent instance
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~~New and clean Starbucks. Plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy when the weather is nice. The closed study room is a nice idea but sounds from main room echo through it. I wore headphones to cancel the noise. I also found the long bar table to be too close to the register. Too much traffic and noise to get much work done there. Also, the table chairs are not cushioned and pretty uncomfortable. There seems to be underutilized open space. I posted a picture of rude people taking up the whole row of seats (I'll take it down if that's not allowed). But anyways, don't be like them.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~~This is your typical Starbucks with the typical menu, however, it's not a very typical set up. I was really impressed with this place, although the location next to a main road doesn't make it as appealing as a spot in cool section of the city. Considering that I have yet to see a cool section of Phoenix during my visits.The pros:1.  Fantastic wifi. They use Google for their network and it works perfectly. No lag, no long loading times. Just perfect. Why don't all Starbucks use Google for their internet?2.  Very cool decor. I really liked the small room where people could get together for a lunch or evening meeting. Gave it a very official feeling.3.  Nice staff. Made the drinks just the right way.The cons:1.  Not a fan of the location next to a main road. Has that strip mall ambiance going for it.A good spot in general.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~~When I heard they were making that old bank into a Starbucks, I couldn't have been more happier.I volunteer at the school down the street from the Starbucks so I visit this one about two times a week. I'm practically considered a regular since they already know my name and know what I want since I get the same thing every time.The place is very spacious, not your average sized Starbucks. It has a variety of seating options and a nice outdoor seating area. The staff is very friendly and always greet everyone with a smile. It's very refreshing to have that on an early Monday morning.The only complaint I have is that there's this one barista (can't remember her name) who messes up my order whenever she takes it. I understand once, maybe twice, but not every time. Luckily the baristas who know me and what I order ask if it's correct which is really appreciated.This has to be my favorite Starbucks. I live just down the street from another one, but I prefer to travel down to that side of town to see a friendly familiar face and a good drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 30, 2013~Very nice to have a drive thru here.  And there's a lot of parking and seating if you walk in, too. The meeting room is cool. Very nice use of the old building with a patio added for the cool weather.  The park nearby makes this a great stop with the dogs. Puppicino!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jan 4, 2014~I'm not a huge Starbucks fan because I'm not a huge hot coffee person, but I do love their teas. This location has a line for the drive through at almost all hours of the day. Walk in! There is no line and you'll get your coffee or drink in no time. The oatmeal is good and the staff was nice when j was there.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 2, 2014~Everytime I come into this Starbucks location it is a Filthy mess!  I have been coming to this location for months and months. Today I ordered a Trenta Very Berry Hibiscus and they did not know to do a Trenta tea refill for me after they have been doing it for months and months. As far as it being a filthy mess in here, please refer to my photos of the trash cans overflowing and not being emptied. I do not think that I will be coming back to this location ever again.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Sep 17, 2013~I have nothing bad to say about this place. I've only used the drive thru and they are always fast and pleasant. Actually, super perky. Must be all the coffee they are drinking. Anyway, I would recommend it if you are in the area and want a quick drive thru treat.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Apr 19, 2016~Not good- people working there are not nice and act like they absolutely hate their job, coffee isn't hot, get charged the wrong amount, always a long wait, sucky Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Oct 11, 2016~First time trying this location. Had a question on a new drink I wanted to try but I was quickly brushed off and assumed I ordered. Ended up getting my drink quite quickly, only good thing about it. Did not have a chance to properly order my beverage.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Mar 11, 2014~Still worst Starbucks in area. Probably in whole state. Cold food that's been `"heated up`", too much ice, can't ask for anything to be remade without attitude coming back, can't say anything without getting interrupted in drive thru, employees talk about inappropriate topics that they think we can't hear... not sure how they pick a manager but this is embarrassing. AVOID THIS TRAP.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Sep 24, 2017~Worst experience... Do managers or district managers even QA stores? Went in when it was busy. Seemed like I was holding up Mary-Beth and was rushed while deciding. No hellos given. After ordering at one point she asked a barista to get something and said `"sank you sank you`" and bowed and the other barista did the same...? are they being racist? or do they think we can't hear while we wait. Or both? Didn't know where the manager was. Loud baristas and drive thru attendants that were laughing so loud I couldn't hear my own conversation. What the heck is going on at this location? Who hired this circus. Don't go in before 830. My friend and I left displeased, regretfully not stopping at our usual Starbucks down the road. What a bleeping joke for $10 coffee
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~~Slowest Starbucks in the valley. Plus they are always out of the healthier breakfast sandwiches.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~This location isn't in the nicest part of town, but it's actually a pretty nice Starbucks, with beautiful landscaping and a huge walled-in patio set a ways off the street. Like other locations, the staff are friendly and do a good job. And bonus - there's a drive-thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~~They make good drinks and take your order quickly. However, you then have to wait as they make all the drinks for the drive thru first. So far I have been waiting 10 minutes and still have someone in front waiting for his coffee, when I can see that not only have 4 cars gone by in the drive thru including the truck that pulled in after I came in and ordered. I don't mind waiting but I think the customer service should be equal. They did wish me a happy New Year though and apologized for the wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Oct 30, 2015~I'm never the one to write reviews, especially when it's not a nice one. I've order from here a hand full of times and the only time it's correct is when I mobile order it. I was a partner with Starbucks for 4 years, opened 2 stores and worked in 2 stores during my time w them. My drink really isn't hard. It takes listening and that's it. I don't feel like the partners at this location care at all to listen or fix my issue. Today she asked me 3 times what my order was and still got it wrong. Her solution when I said that's wrong was to give me another empty cup to fix my problem. Well when I worked there (end of 2017) when we got something wrong we were more than happy to fix it which meant remake the entire drink not just give the customer a new empty cup. If you guys aren't going to listen to an appropriate music playlist turn off your outside speakers; another thing there probably shouldn't be used dirty needles in the rocks surrounding the patio.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 16, 2015~great service! Barista name Ne Bria helped with full of happy energy and smiles! I will go back and recommend others to this location over others! Thanks Nebria!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Jan 2, 2016~The layout and architecture of this Starbucks makes it a great place to work or read. It's very different than any other Starbucks I've been in. I've been here multiple times and the people that work there are always very nice and accommodating. Not only that, professional. I was there in the evening one time and some kids were being very loud both outside and inside.  After about ten minutes they told them they needed to go. I thought how they did it was nice and thoughtful to the other patrons.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~Aug 1, 2020~This Starbucks is a loser. The drive-through always takes a minimum of 10 to 12 minutes no matter what time of day it is. The drinks  always taste just a little off. I swear every time I order a cold brew I'm just getting iced coffee. Fine, but not for double the price!! Consistently bad.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Oct 10, 2016~Had to give this experience five stars! Started with friendly &amp; helpful service from Brittany, who I assume was the shift supervisor from the impressive way she interacted with me, other customers and her co-workers throughout the 90 minutes I was there for a meeting. . . . I also like that this is a `"Reserve`" store, and tried the Hawaiian variety, which was excellent. . . . Because our meeting involved 8 people, we `"rented`" their meeting room, which can be secured for a $50 gift card purchase (which is really no cost for a Starbucks regular). . . . I don't live or work close to this location, but highly recommend it, based on this positive experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jul 16, 2014~Came here three days in a row and brought my own tall cup and was charged 3 different prices each day. Spoke to the manager and she did not know why and she can't do nothing about it. At least she charged me tge correct price. Poor accountability.  Service is also very slow going on 10 min waiting for coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~1~May 24, 2017~Watched the guy making my drink stop halfway to flirt with a girl in the drive thru and upgrade her drink size although he's `"really not supposed to`". After about 9 minutes of waiting (Starbucks was not busy at all), the girl who rang me up ran over to save the day and finish making my drink. Zero stars for the guy working there with the dark hair, beard and no game.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~~I really like this location and it is within 5 minutes away. There is neither never a line at the drive thru or it seems to go very quick. Employees are friendly in addition. No complaints thus far! Thank you Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~Huuuuuuuuuuuuuge Starbucks. One of the largest I've been in. Great meeting space. Good wi-fi. Otherwise, it's your typical wonderful Starbucks experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~~Love this Starbucks as well as other I do all Starbucks but this location has some employees from my regular Starbucks and it is wonderful to see happy faces that are missed from my everyday Starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Jun 8, 2014~This location is awesome! Less congested at times than stores nearby, beautiful interior! A private meeting room even! Super friendly staff at all times!
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~Jul 30, 2015~No coffee brewed and ready to serve at 9:00 AM with 7 people working behind the counter. They Forgot about me after it finished brewing. Half and half was empty. 20 minutes for a basic cup of coffee. Not the best baristas in the Starbucks system. At least the coffee tasted OK.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~3~May 22, 2015~Busy location but they get the job done. Spacious place. Even when busy its not super loud.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~May 8, 2015~The staff is impeccable with superb customer service!  My favorite Starbucks by far.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~2~May 15, 2014~@Starbucks drove across town to go to a store that is advertised to be opened at 430 on your app.  It is closed. Ur wasting my time.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~4~Oct 25, 2014~This store just opened up across the parking lot from my office, and I'm very happy. The staff is all very friendly and helpful. I'm not the HUGEST fan of Starbucks coffee itself, but I LOVE their Berry Hibiscus Refresher.
Phoenix, AZ 85016~5~Apr 23, 2014~I was so excited to have this Starbucks open in my neighborhood!!!  I can walk there, get my coffee, and relax on the nice outdoor patio.  The service is great, friendly, cheerful employees.  Always a super `"time out`" in my day!
