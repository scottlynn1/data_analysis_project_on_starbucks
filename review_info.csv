Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Oct 5, 2024~Chris! Chris the cashier is why I'm writing this! He's soooo polite! He's great at customer service and has a beautiful smile! We felt his good energy from the ordering box. His team member made my cousin's coffee wrong. When we came back to get it fixed, he made a fresh one himself!She loved it!Bless Chris!
Montgomery, AL 36106~2 star rating~Mar 27, 2024~This is one of most the most crowded and worst possible positioned places nearly a wreck a day happens due to the crowded and borderline scary drive thru to go through.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Nov 9, 2023~I received a breakfast sandwich that was missing the egg via a drive-thru order. By the time I looked at it I was already at work. I returned to ask for a sandwich made correctly and the lobby was closed due to understaffing. When I called to request a replacement for my wrong sandwich I was told I had to go through the drive-thru AGAIN and wait 20 more minutes for them to correct their mistake. I asked if they could please just make the sandwich and hand it to me through the lobby door since it was their mistake and I was told no. I walked to the drive-thru window and asked the waiting customer if I could please talk with the store employee (going through the drive-thru) and Kate Young was extremely rude and disrespectful and was yelling at me to get out of the drive-thru. When in fact I did exactly what she said to go thru the drive-thru but I just didn't get in line. I filed a complaint with corporate immediately (took 46 minutes more of my time) so I could at least get reimbursed for the cost of the sandwich. When I asked Kate Young for the store manager's number she could not even provide me with that. Poor shift management and an incredibly disappointing and disrespectful interaction with Kate Young. Very childish and unprofessional. I would recommend going to a different location other than the one at 3110 Zelda Rd in Montgomery , AL.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Sep 5, 2022~Starbucks is usually pretty consistent and enjoyable all the way around. Unfortunately this location is terrible. Went back to back days. Out of stock on many items but that was the least of it.  No line and waited a solid 10 minutes to put in a simple order of two drinks and two sandwiches. Dining area is a mess. Workers look over stressed. Avoid this location and get your coffee and breakfast needs somewhere else. Anywhere else.
Montgomery, AL 36106~4 star rating~Nov 28, 2020~I've been visiting this location while on vacation in the area. Very friendly staff! Cheerful voices over the drive-thru mic and my order is always on point!
Montgomery, AL 36106~4 star rating~Jun 26, 2018~Coffee, breakfast sandwich and service were all fine.Enjoyed sitting outside on patio enjoying the breeze.Appreciate the option to use mugs instead of paper cups--it makes for a better coffee experience, and is better for the environment.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Jun 14, 2021~I'm not sure about the other negative reviews but I was very impressed with the level of customer service and speed at this location. Every employee was exceptionally friendly and professional. I'm not a local but this would be my go to if I lived in the area.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Aug 7, 2021~Everytime I come here my drink is wrong ! I make sure to repeat it and I still get a horrible drink . I worked for Starbucks for 8 years and I've never been to a Starbucks as worse as this one . Everytime I say light  ice they act like it's hindering them personally .Ma'am it's 105 degrees outside and ice melts ! I don't need a half of cup of ice in a grande drink !  They all need to retrain . Whoever the DM is in this area needs to hop on it ASAP!
Montgomery, AL 36106~2 star rating~May 28, 2016~Not my go-to Starbucks. I usually walk into a Starbucks. Don't really like the layout or the atmosphere.  I agree with another reviewer that they are not efficient. It takes way too long for a simple black coffee and something from the food case. Probably a solid 5 minutes or more before I got my bagel and it wasn't even that crowded. The most recent visit was the epitome of laziness. Ordered a strawberry banana smoothie for my GF in drive thru and the guy hands me the drink with the top half hanging off. It was like he couldn't be bothered to take a second, take the drink back inside and place the lid on securely. I had to secure the lid myself. C'mon man! Not like there was anyone behind me in the drive thru....
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Mar 4, 2020~I love Starbucks. I was in town today for a funeral. I arrived early so I decided to stop for coffee at 12:30 pm. There were at least 5 people working and I stood there 5 minutes and finally left. It was busy in the drive through but not inside. Worst Starbucks experience. Also it was the dirty and messy. It needs some training and a good cleaning.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Apr 9, 2022~I walked in to find that most of the staff had decided to take a break, despite the long line of cars outside waiting to place an order. I have had recently had surgery on my foot and am using a scooter to get around. The staff kept me standing for several minutes without so much as a `"We'll be with you soon.`"  When they finally got around to taking my order they got it wrong. No wonder the top management at Starbucks has recently had a shakeup--if this is typical, a shakeup was in order. Certainly, this location needs a shakeup.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Jun 30, 2018~Good location, clean bathroom, friendly staff, quick service. Located near Publix on Zelda Rd; It wasn't busy at all for 8am on a Saturday morning, so I got in and out quickly.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Nov 23, 2019~They were friendly. But they could not get a single drink in our order correct, even when asked to remake them.  Completely inept. Sweet but inept.
Montgomery, AL 36106~3 star rating~May 5, 2018~This second visit was for the Happy hour.  I  had  gotten a Frappuccino and it wasn't that sweet and it had a watery taste, which I don't know why.  I can't say that I love it. It did look good after it was handed to me, but the taste wasn't not enough to say I'm coming back. I did taste the mocha in it, which I was glad and that was only good thing besides the whip cream.  I didn't go wild about this one. That's why I'll be going to other locations , because I know I've had ones way better than this one.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Mar 15, 2020~Stopped through on the road to Atlanta, they had great customer service!! My drink was super fresh and it was just good as hell!!!
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Sep 26, 2019~The staff member `"Ayla`" that helped me this morning is exactly how customer service should be! She was extremely quick, very kind and helpful to a couple requests I had last second. Will come back to this location based on her kindness alonez
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Oct 18, 2020~I worked at Starbucks for over 5 years before the pandemic hit and now I'm a regular at all locations at my area . Everytime I go to Zelda road my drink is made wrong . The staff have attitudes and never wanna correct my drink instead they look at me like I don't know what I'm talking about because they don't know I'm a former partner! I literally only get a dragon drink and add strawberry açaí . And they never fill my drink up or they don't add the ingredients ! I spend $6 twice a day and this is what I get
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Jun 23, 2019~If I could give 0 stars I would! Let me tell you why- JP in the drive-thru was very rude and unprofessional. Upon arriving to the window we asked if any banana bread was available. JP's response to our question was, `"I swear I'm going to kill the next person that comes through the drive-thru.`" After receiving our drinks, JP told us, `"All we're waiting on now is the god-damned banana bread.`" We we're appalled! Horrible service. Never coming back. This took place on June 23rd, 2019 around 4 in the afternoon. JP was also arguing with the person ahead of us in the drive-thru line before we pulled up to the window. Fire him!
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Aug 7, 2014~I am a big fan of Starbucks, Why? I travel all over the country and world and I like trying independent coffee houses but they are always a hit or miss. But with Starbucks they are always consistent and always just right.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Aug 5, 2022~I was in the drive thru line but it was very long and moving slow so I placed a mobile order for DRIVE THRU and once I got to the window the person on the headset told me to get back in line when I've already waited 15 mins to get to the speaker and the line was still backed up to the street. I have things to do and did not have time to get back in line again. So they told me to come inside and I did and I still waited longer than the time it was supposed to be ready so I asked a barista for my order and it was sitting on the counter sweating. It was also made incorrectly but I didn't have time to ask for it to be remade. Great way to show empathy to your customers. I still don't get the difference of ordering at the speaker or ordering a mobile order for the drive thru. I do it all the time and this is the first time I've run into this problem, very disappointed. This happened at about 9am-9:20am on 8/5.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2 star rating~Jul 23, 2021~I went through the drive through on Zelda rd the cashier was very friendly and gave good service, but my drinks awful!!! They got one drink wrong  and the other one was not good wasted $11
Montgomery, AL 36106~2 star rating~Nov 1, 2018~This location never has organic chai tea, the only thing my wife orders.  I've called, spoken with the manager on several occasions.  Stopped this morning. No chai.  I doubt my wife will ever go back and I doubt the guy at the register cares.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Feb 14, 2018~Skip took care of us. This place is great, they really care about the customer service at this location.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~May 5, 2021~Slowest service in town. Perky will only get you so far. Mobile order pickup from drive through 25 minutes later and they lost my order??? Ridiculous. Cars cutting thru line. They should go to chick-fil-a for training.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2 star rating~Jul 5, 2020~It took legitimately 30 minutes for them to deliver our basic order. They made us feel guilty that there was a line, which is completely out of our control, and it was due to the fact that the woman taking orders took so unbelievably long to type in our information. They also have us the wrong drink despite the lengthy wait. Will not return. Ever.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2 star rating~Sep 6, 2018~Not only is the service slow my items were not bagged,  I bought 3 pounds of coffee that were just given to me without a bag. I also bought a mug which they did put in a bag, with an order of 3 pounds of coffee they should know better and just bag it without me having to ask for one. I think I'll just go to the one on Eastern, it's further away but the service is better.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Jan 16, 2018~One of the best Starbucks locations I've ever been to! Excellent customer service - the baristas were so friendly and worked well together. The drinks came out quickly and tasted delicious. Wish more locations were as nice as this one!
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Oct 7, 2020~I have come here three times (Two of the those times I have been made late for work because they wouldn't refund my Starbucks gift card) and will NEVER come here again. They are always understaffed and the few staff they do have are either incompetent or unwilling to work. Every other starbucks I have been to has NEVER had a line out the door or a line all the way out to the street because they are better than this place - and they are the locations I will be going to from now on.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Jun 19, 2014~Best Starbucks I've been to.Cleanest, best service.  My husband and I go there at least 5 times a week.  The Manager, Carrie, is beyond reproach and the staff are happy and well-trained.There has been a high turnover of staff over the last few months (graduating and going to College mostly) so we miss the old faces, but the new ones are a pleasure to deal with.I never know what I want, and they have the patience and knowledge to work with me and suggest drinks that I might like - they're great at this :)They are our family and we are so grateful for them - each one adds a little sunshine to our day.  Keep up the great work, guys!
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Nov 14, 2020~Starbucks in Montgomery on Zelda Rd. is one of the worst locations I have been to. They have messed up my coffee well over 5 times now. I go to this location because it's the closest location to my house, but I won't be giving them by business anymore. A few weeks ago, I ordered a drink from there from the drive thru and it wasn't made good at all. Then, I had to go inside to get them to remake it, and it still wasn't good. I ordered a grande drink today and there is about 2.5 inches worth of drink that I paid for, missing from my cup.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Oct 10, 2020~This is the starbucks nearest, but it would be faster to go out the way than this one. It is very very slow, the orders are not normally accurate either. Past two times they've been messed up. It's typically simple orders, too. They struggle with understanding how the rewards systems work, and Ive had a couple times where they use my stars instead of scanning to earn them. It's extremely slow and I've waited 20+ minutes in the drive through for a simple drink.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Jul 5, 2020~Stopped at this Starbucks on our way through Montgomery back to KC, only because w had gained time on our trip. After leaving this starbucks, our arrival time was much later than originally projected. The girl taking our very simple order took almost 15 minutes and decided that while taking our order would also be a good time to take inventory. After ordering, the barista made us feel bad about the long line she had created and even messed up our very simple order. Never returning!
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Jul 27, 2019~Best starbucks in all of Montgomery. I've only ever had one or two drinks where the roast has been burnt in all of my years coming here. The staff is amazing, especially Kate, Jasmine, and Ayla. I will drive across town to get my drink from here on my lunch break because the starbucks on zelda is the only starbucks that makes it amazing every time.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2 star rating~Oct 8, 2011~Occasionally Starbucks gets over-brew or burn-the-beans happy, and my Pikes roast cup incurred this fate.Starbucks still serves as a refuge during lengthy travel for it's consistency in pleasant ambiance, lovely service, and food/coffee offerings.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~May 3, 2018~Just had a very bad experience here today. Me and my cousin came to get Frappuchinos for the Happy Hour.  They order, and can't get it because they don't have their Starbucks cards with them (which is understandable because they didn't know).  I order after 1-2 minutes of waiting (Again, understandable since it was busy), and I have my Starbucks Rewards card with me. The cashier tells me that you had to order two in order to get the discount, which, after reading the website, was NOT a requirement. I'm angry at this point, but I still go through with the order anyway because I already came out that way. I don't get my drink for at least 5-7 minutes after my order, even though people who ordered after me had already gotten their drinks. Also, the cashier who took my cousin's order put the order in incorrectly, causing his order to be almost a dollar more than it should've been. Other minor nitpicky things happened there, but this whole experience is enough to have convinced me to not go to this location anymore. If you want Starbucks in Montgomery, go to the Bypass or Atlanta Highway, it's worth the extra gas for better service.UPDATE: Tried the drink I ordered, and it doesn't taste right either. I'm not sure if they used the wrong brew or what, but I've had this happen in the past with drinks that I know should taste different. Overall, a bad experience in general. As said before, I'm not coming back.  If I want a Frappe and I'm in that area, I'd rather just go to McDonalds or Panera.  I've had better drinks at both of those locations than I've ever had at this Starbucks.UPDATE 2: Tried the frap. I ordered the other day from a different location, and now I know that they made basically the entire thing incorrectly. Unless you want bad service and incorrectly made drinks, avoid this location as best you can.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Jul 10, 2016~Great place to study. The staff was superb! I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for good lighting and big personal tables.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2 star rating~Nov 21, 2015~Nice staff but not efficient. I ordered a grande coffee with cream and received a tall. And they completely forgot to make one of the drinks in our 3 drink order. The drive through seemed steady but we were the only customers waiting in the store. I don't think I'll be back to this location.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1 star rating~Dec 30, 2016~If I could give zero stars I would. Terrible customer service (could even get a simple order right), extremely long wait, rude employees, &amp; when I asked to speak to the manager about it he was even worse. Will never go back to that place.
Montgomery, AL 36106~4 star rating~Apr 21, 2011~This is my favorite local Starbucks. The baristas are nice, remember your drinks &amp; it's a good place to sit inside or outside to chat, meet friends or study.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2 star rating~Feb 7, 2014~It's a management issue.  The baristas are great, most of them... However the way they are treated absolutely sucks.  Talk to them about it sometime.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Jan 29, 2017~Always a favorite of mine. Love that they will make a pour over in dark roast when not offered brewed. Great customer service is usually the norm, although all locations are not equal.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2 star rating~Jan 31, 2013~Within the last few months, the vast majority of the highly efficient and friendly crew who had been working at this Starbucks for several years have left. The remaining veterans are trying their best to train the replacements, but it seems to be an uphill struggle thus far. The new barristers have a long way to go before they can come up to an acceptable level of competence and customer service. This is not for lack of trying, but the reality is that this Starbucks has gone from the best one in the Gump to the worst. Whatever you do, avoid this place during busy times. Mixed up orders, long delays in getting relatively simple drinks or snacks ready for the customers, mistakes in entering correct prices into the cash register: the list goes on and on. I hate to be negative, as I really like this place and want it to succeed. It is large (making finding a seat relatively easy) conveniently located to my house, and just a great spot to relax and read or do a bit of work. Until things improve, though, I'm keeping my distance, and encourage others to do the same.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Jun 15, 2016~This is my favorite coffee place in Montgomery. All the baristas know my name and my order, and they've always been very friendly and accommodating. They keep it very clean and well staffed, so even when they're busy you don't have to wait too long. There are four leather chairs that are *super* comfy for long study/reading/knitting sessions; I'm just surprised my favorite one doesn't have my permanent butt print in it yet! I could practically live here, so you may as well give it a visit!Edit: I just want to add, I recently overhead two off-shift baristas gossiping about their boss. They were saying how much they appreciate how she treats them and respect her for all the hard work she does to make this store the best it can be. Seriously, at how many chain restaurants do you think the employees chat about how much they like their boss? I know for a *fact* no one says that sort of thing about the owners of Cafe Louisa - quite the opposite, actually.

Montgomery, AL 36106~3 star rating~Dec 27, 2014~Not as great as they could be. I like this shop, but they don't seem to pay attention to the details of my orders. Often drive to the Vaugh Rd location for a better experience.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5 star rating~Sep 2, 2013~Fantastic staff and wonderful drinks. The service and beverage quality make me want to return daily. I cannot say enough good things. My only complaint is parking is a little lacking, but that isn't a deal breaker.
Montgomery, AL 36109~5 star rating~May 30, 2024~I love using the app cuz it makes things faster. They got my drinks correct!!  The line was short and the service was fast and great!!
Montgomery, AL 36109~1 star rating~Nov 28, 2024~The customer service was fine, but the drink preparation was consistently disappointing. I had to ask for my drink to be remade three times, yet it still wasn't right. I gave them multiple chances, but after the third visit, it's clear I won't be returning. I sincerely hope they improve.
Montgomery, AL 36109~4 star rating~May 20, 2023~I enjoyed Starbucks for breakfast or for later on in the day. My fav that I'm enjoying is the maple butter chicken and egg sandwich for breakfast. Yum!  I also like to try out new different flavors drinks that comes out during different seasons and including coffee. My only complaint for Starbucks is I wish you can add your star points at home, like barcode,  even if you're not able to have them to scan on site. Like give us that option, please.
