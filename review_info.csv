Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Oct 5, 2024~Chris! Chris the cashier is why I'm writing this! He's soooo polite! He's great at customer service and has a beautiful smile! We felt his good energy from the ordering box. His team member made my cousin's coffee wrong. When we came back to get it fixed, he made a fresh one himself!She loved it!Bless Chris!
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Mar 27, 2024~This is one of most the most crowded and worst possible positioned places nearly a wreck a day happens due to the crowded and borderline scary drive thru to go through.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Nov 9, 2023~I received a breakfast sandwich that was missing the egg via a drive-thru order. By the time I looked at it I was already at work. I returned to ask for a sandwich made correctly and the lobby was closed due to understaffing. When I called to request a replacement for my wrong sandwich I was told I had to go through the drive-thru AGAIN and wait 20 more minutes for them to correct their mistake. I asked if they could please just make the sandwich and hand it to me through the lobby door since it was their mistake and I was told no. I walked to the drive-thru window and asked the waiting customer if I could please talk with the store employee (going through the drive-thru) and Kate Young was extremely rude and disrespectful and was yelling at me to get out of the drive-thru. When in fact I did exactly what she said to go thru the drive-thru but I just didn't get in line. I filed a complaint with corporate immediately (took 46 minutes more of my time) so I could at least get reimbursed for the cost of the sandwich. When I asked Kate Young for the store manager's number she could not even provide me with that. Poor shift management and an incredibly disappointing and disrespectful interaction with Kate Young. Very childish and unprofessional. I would recommend going to a different location other than the one at 3110 Zelda Rd in Montgomery , AL.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Sep 5, 2022~Starbucks is usually pretty consistent and enjoyable all the way around. Unfortunately this location is terrible. Went back to back days. Out of stock on many items but that was the least of it.  No line and waited a solid 10 minutes to put in a simple order of two drinks and two sandwiches. Dining area is a mess. Workers look over stressed. Avoid this location and get your coffee and breakfast needs somewhere else. Anywhere else.
Montgomery, AL 36106~4~Nov 28, 2020~I've been visiting this location while on vacation in the area. Very friendly staff! Cheerful voices over the drive-thru mic and my order is always on point!
Montgomery, AL 36106~4~Jun 26, 2018~Coffee, breakfast sandwich and service were all fine.Enjoyed sitting outside on patio enjoying the breeze.Appreciate the option to use mugs instead of paper cups--it makes for a better coffee experience, and is better for the environment.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jun 14, 2021~I'm not sure about the other negative reviews but I was very impressed with the level of customer service and speed at this location. Every employee was exceptionally friendly and professional. I'm not a local but this would be my go to if I lived in the area.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Aug 7, 2021~Everytime I come here my drink is wrong ! I make sure to repeat it and I still get a horrible drink . I worked for Starbucks for 8 years and I've never been to a Starbucks as worse as this one . Everytime I say light  ice they act like it's hindering them personally .Ma'am it's 105 degrees outside and ice melts ! I don't need a half of cup of ice in a grande drink !  They all need to retrain . Whoever the DM is in this area needs to hop on it ASAP!
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~May 28, 2016~Not my go-to Starbucks. I usually walk into a Starbucks. Don't really like the layout or the atmosphere.  I agree with another reviewer that they are not efficient. It takes way too long for a simple black coffee and something from the food case. Probably a solid 5 minutes or more before I got my bagel and it wasn't even that crowded. The most recent visit was the epitome of laziness. Ordered a strawberry banana smoothie for my GF in drive thru and the guy hands me the drink with the top half hanging off. It was like he couldn't be bothered to take a second, take the drink back inside and place the lid on securely. I had to secure the lid myself. C'mon man! Not like there was anyone behind me in the drive thru....
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Mar 4, 2020~I love Starbucks. I was in town today for a funeral. I arrived early so I decided to stop for coffee at 12:30 pm. There were at least 5 people working and I stood there 5 minutes and finally left. It was busy in the drive through but not inside. Worst Starbucks experience. Also it was the dirty and messy. It needs some training and a good cleaning.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Apr 9, 2022~I walked in to find that most of the staff had decided to take a break, despite the long line of cars outside waiting to place an order. I have had recently had surgery on my foot and am using a scooter to get around. The staff kept me standing for several minutes without so much as a `"We'll be with you soon.`"  When they finally got around to taking my order they got it wrong. No wonder the top management at Starbucks has recently had a shakeup--if this is typical, a shakeup was in order. Certainly, this location needs a shakeup.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jun 30, 2018~Good location, clean bathroom, friendly staff, quick service. Located near Publix on Zelda Rd; It wasn't busy at all for 8am on a Saturday morning, so I got in and out quickly.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Nov 23, 2019~They were friendly. But they could not get a single drink in our order correct, even when asked to remake them.  Completely inept. Sweet but inept.
Montgomery, AL 36106~3~May 5, 2018~This second visit was for the Happy hour.  I  had  gotten a Frappuccino and it wasn't that sweet and it had a watery taste, which I don't know why.  I can't say that I love it. It did look good after it was handed to me, but the taste wasn't not enough to say I'm coming back. I did taste the mocha in it, which I was glad and that was only good thing besides the whip cream.  I didn't go wild about this one. That's why I'll be going to other locations , because I know I've had ones way better than this one.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Mar 15, 2020~Stopped through on the road to Atlanta, they had great customer service!! My drink was super fresh and it was just good as hell!!!
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Sep 26, 2019~The staff member `"Ayla`" that helped me this morning is exactly how customer service should be! She was extremely quick, very kind and helpful to a couple requests I had last second. Will come back to this location based on her kindness alonez
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Oct 18, 2020~I worked at Starbucks for over 5 years before the pandemic hit and now I'm a regular at all locations at my area . Everytime I go to Zelda road my drink is made wrong . The staff have attitudes and never wanna correct my drink instead they look at me like I don't know what I'm talking about because they don't know I'm a former partner! I literally only get a dragon drink and add strawberry açaí . And they never fill my drink up or they don't add the ingredients ! I spend $6 twice a day and this is what I get
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Jun 23, 2019~If I could give 0 stars I would! Let me tell you why- JP in the drive-thru was very rude and unprofessional. Upon arriving to the window we asked if any banana bread was available. JP's response to our question was, `"I swear I'm going to kill the next person that comes through the drive-thru.`" After receiving our drinks, JP told us, `"All we're waiting on now is the god-damned banana bread.`" We we're appalled! Horrible service. Never coming back. This took place on June 23rd, 2019 around 4 in the afternoon. JP was also arguing with the person ahead of us in the drive-thru line before we pulled up to the window. Fire him!
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Aug 7, 2014~I am a big fan of Starbucks, Why? I travel all over the country and world and I like trying independent coffee houses but they are always a hit or miss. But with Starbucks they are always consistent and always just right.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Aug 5, 2022~I was in the drive thru line but it was very long and moving slow so I placed a mobile order for DRIVE THRU and once I got to the window the person on the headset told me to get back in line when I've already waited 15 mins to get to the speaker and the line was still backed up to the street. I have things to do and did not have time to get back in line again. So they told me to come inside and I did and I still waited longer than the time it was supposed to be ready so I asked a barista for my order and it was sitting on the counter sweating. It was also made incorrectly but I didn't have time to ask for it to be remade. Great way to show empathy to your customers. I still don't get the difference of ordering at the speaker or ordering a mobile order for the drive thru. I do it all the time and this is the first time I've run into this problem, very disappointed. This happened at about 9am-9:20am on 8/5.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Jul 23, 2021~I went through the drive through on Zelda rd the cashier was very friendly and gave good service, but my drinks awful!!! They got one drink wrong  and the other one was not good wasted $11
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Nov 1, 2018~This location never has organic chai tea, the only thing my wife orders.  I've called, spoken with the manager on several occasions.  Stopped this morning. No chai.  I doubt my wife will ever go back and I doubt the guy at the register cares.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Feb 14, 2018~Skip took care of us. This place is great, they really care about the customer service at this location.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~May 5, 2021~Slowest service in town. Perky will only get you so far. Mobile order pickup from drive through 25 minutes later and they lost my order??? Ridiculous. Cars cutting thru line. They should go to chick-fil-a for training.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Jul 5, 2020~It took legitimately 30 minutes for them to deliver our basic order. They made us feel guilty that there was a line, which is completely out of our control, and it was due to the fact that the woman taking orders took so unbelievably long to type in our information. They also have us the wrong drink despite the lengthy wait. Will not return. Ever.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Sep 6, 2018~Not only is the service slow my items were not bagged,  I bought 3 pounds of coffee that were just given to me without a bag. I also bought a mug which they did put in a bag, with an order of 3 pounds of coffee they should know better and just bag it without me having to ask for one. I think I'll just go to the one on Eastern, it's further away but the service is better.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jan 16, 2018~One of the best Starbucks locations I've ever been to! Excellent customer service - the baristas were so friendly and worked well together. The drinks came out quickly and tasted delicious. Wish more locations were as nice as this one!
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Oct 7, 2020~I have come here three times (Two of the those times I have been made late for work because they wouldn't refund my Starbucks gift card) and will NEVER come here again. They are always understaffed and the few staff they do have are either incompetent or unwilling to work. Every other starbucks I have been to has NEVER had a line out the door or a line all the way out to the street because they are better than this place - and they are the locations I will be going to from now on.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jun 19, 2014~Best Starbucks I've been to.Cleanest, best service.  My husband and I go there at least 5 times a week.  The Manager, Carrie, is beyond reproach and the staff are happy and well-trained.There has been a high turnover of staff over the last few months (graduating and going to College mostly) so we miss the old faces, but the new ones are a pleasure to deal with.I never know what I want, and they have the patience and knowledge to work with me and suggest drinks that I might like - they're great at this :)They are our family and we are so grateful for them - each one adds a little sunshine to our day.  Keep up the great work, guys!
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Nov 14, 2020~Starbucks in Montgomery on Zelda Rd. is one of the worst locations I have been to. They have messed up my coffee well over 5 times now. I go to this location because it's the closest location to my house, but I won't be giving them by business anymore. A few weeks ago, I ordered a drink from there from the drive thru and it wasn't made good at all. Then, I had to go inside to get them to remake it, and it still wasn't good. I ordered a grande drink today and there is about 2.5 inches worth of drink that I paid for, missing from my cup.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Oct 10, 2020~This is the starbucks nearest, but it would be faster to go out the way than this one. It is very very slow, the orders are not normally accurate either. Past two times they've been messed up. It's typically simple orders, too. They struggle with understanding how the rewards systems work, and Ive had a couple times where they use my stars instead of scanning to earn them. It's extremely slow and I've waited 20+ minutes in the drive through for a simple drink.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Jul 5, 2020~Stopped at this Starbucks on our way through Montgomery back to KC, only because w had gained time on our trip. After leaving this starbucks, our arrival time was much later than originally projected. The girl taking our very simple order took almost 15 minutes and decided that while taking our order would also be a good time to take inventory. After ordering, the barista made us feel bad about the long line she had created and even messed up our very simple order. Never returning!
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jul 27, 2019~Best starbucks in all of Montgomery. I've only ever had one or two drinks where the roast has been burnt in all of my years coming here. The staff is amazing, especially Kate, Jasmine, and Ayla. I will drive across town to get my drink from here on my lunch break because the starbucks on zelda is the only starbucks that makes it amazing every time.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Oct 8, 2011~Occasionally Starbucks gets over-brew or burn-the-beans happy, and my Pikes roast cup incurred this fate.Starbucks still serves as a refuge during lengthy travel for it's consistency in pleasant ambiance, lovely service, and food/coffee offerings.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~May 3, 2018~Just had a very bad experience here today. Me and my cousin came to get Frappuchinos for the Happy Hour.  They order, and can't get it because they don't have their Starbucks cards with them (which is understandable because they didn't know).  I order after 1-2 minutes of waiting (Again, understandable since it was busy), and I have my Starbucks Rewards card with me. The cashier tells me that you had to order two in order to get the discount, which, after reading the website, was NOT a requirement. I'm angry at this point, but I still go through with the order anyway because I already came out that way. I don't get my drink for at least 5-7 minutes after my order, even though people who ordered after me had already gotten their drinks. Also, the cashier who took my cousin's order put the order in incorrectly, causing his order to be almost a dollar more than it should've been. Other minor nitpicky things happened there, but this whole experience is enough to have convinced me to not go to this location anymore. If you want Starbucks in Montgomery, go to the Bypass or Atlanta Highway, it's worth the extra gas for better service.UPDATE: Tried the drink I ordered, and it doesn't taste right either. I'm not sure if they used the wrong brew or what, but I've had this happen in the past with drinks that I know should taste different. Overall, a bad experience in general. As said before, I'm not coming back.  If I want a Frappe and I'm in that area, I'd rather just go to McDonalds or Panera.  I've had better drinks at both of those locations than I've ever had at this Starbucks.UPDATE 2: Tried the frap. I ordered the other day from a different location, and now I know that they made basically the entire thing incorrectly. Unless you want bad service and incorrectly made drinks, avoid this location as best you can.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jul 10, 2016~Great place to study. The staff was superb! I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for good lighting and big personal tables.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Nov 21, 2015~Nice staff but not efficient. I ordered a grande coffee with cream and received a tall. And they completely forgot to make one of the drinks in our 3 drink order. The drive through seemed steady but we were the only customers waiting in the store. I don't think I'll be back to this location.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Dec 30, 2016~If I could give zero stars I would. Terrible customer service (could even get a simple order right), extremely long wait, rude employees, &amp; when I asked to speak to the manager about it he was even worse. Will never go back to that place.
Montgomery, AL 36106~4~Apr 21, 2011~This is my favorite local Starbucks. The baristas are nice, remember your drinks &amp; it's a good place to sit inside or outside to chat, meet friends or study.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Feb 7, 2014~It's a management issue.  The baristas are great, most of them... However the way they are treated absolutely sucks.  Talk to them about it sometime.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jan 29, 2017~Always a favorite of mine. Love that they will make a pour over in dark roast when not offered brewed. Great customer service is usually the norm, although all locations are not equal.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Jan 31, 2013~Within the last few months, the vast majority of the highly efficient and friendly crew who had been working at this Starbucks for several years have left. The remaining veterans are trying their best to train the replacements, but it seems to be an uphill struggle thus far. The new barristers have a long way to go before they can come up to an acceptable level of competence and customer service. This is not for lack of trying, but the reality is that this Starbucks has gone from the best one in the Gump to the worst. Whatever you do, avoid this place during busy times. Mixed up orders, long delays in getting relatively simple drinks or snacks ready for the customers, mistakes in entering correct prices into the cash register: the list goes on and on. I hate to be negative, as I really like this place and want it to succeed. It is large (making finding a seat relatively easy) conveniently located to my house, and just a great spot to relax and read or do a bit of work. Until things improve, though, I'm keeping my distance, and encourage others to do the same.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jun 15, 2016~This is my favorite coffee place in Montgomery. All the baristas know my name and my order, and they've always been very friendly and accommodating. They keep it very clean and well staffed, so even when they're busy you don't have to wait too long. There are four leather chairs that are *super* comfy for long study/reading/knitting sessions; I'm just surprised my favorite one doesn't have my permanent butt print in it yet! I could practically live here, so you may as well give it a visit!Edit: I just want to add, I recently overhead two off-shift baristas gossiping about their boss. They were saying how much they appreciate how she treats them and respect her for all the hard work she does to make this store the best it can be. Seriously, at how many chain restaurants do you think the employees chat about how much they like their boss? I know for a *fact* no one says that sort of thing about the owners of Cafe Louisa - quite the opposite, actually. (I don't do it on purpose, maybe it's because I'm quiet, This is my favorite coffee place in Montgomery.

Montgomery, AL 36106~3~Dec 27, 2014~Not as great as they could be. I like this shop, but they don't seem to pay attention to the details of my orders. Often drive to the Vaugh Rd location for a better experience.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Sep 2, 2013~Fantastic staff and wonderful drinks. The service and beverage quality make me want to return daily. I cannot say enough good things. My only complaint is parking is a little lacking, but that isn't a deal breaker.
Montgomery, AL 36109~5~May 30, 2024~I love using the app cuz it makes things faster. They got my drinks correct!!  The line was short and the service was fast and great!!
Montgomery, AL 36109~1~Nov 28, 2024~The customer service was fine, but the drink preparation was consistently disappointing. I had to ask for my drink to be remade three times, yet it still wasn't right. I gave them multiple chances, but after the third visit, it's clear I won't be returning. I sincerely hope they improve.
Montgomery, AL 36109~4~May 20, 2023~I enjoyed Starbucks for breakfast or for later on in the day. My fav that I'm enjoying is the maple butter chicken and egg sandwich for breakfast. Yum!  I also like to try out new different flavors drinks that comes out during different seasons and including coffee. My only complaint for Starbucks is I wish you can add your star points at home, like barcode,  even if you're not able to have them to scan on site. Like give us that option, please.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Nov 16, 2024~Wonderful staff and always make my drinks just the way I like them! Fast and efficient workers who make drinks on time.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Jun 25, 2023~As part of our routine, my spouse and I frequently explore various Starbucks, but unfortunately, consistency has been noticeably lacking over the past couple of years.Upon arrival, my wife placed an order for two coffees while I, anticipating my children's hunger, proceeded to order five sandwiches. Observing the sandwich preparation from a nearby vantage point, I ventured into the men's restroom, only to discover that the lighting was non-functional. Consequently, my children and I resorted to utilizing the illumination from my camera in order to navigate the facilities and wash our hands. Although we managed to overcome this inconvenience, it is disconcerting to encounter such an oversight within a Starbucks establishment. Starbucks, come on? do better...Subsequently, I proceeded towards the designated pickup window, only to find that our sandwiches were not present. After waiting patiently behind other customers, I eventually brought this matter to the attention of the cashier, explaining that approximately 20-22 minutes had elapsed since my initial mobile order. To my surprise, it was discovered that the sandwiches had been placed near the drive-thru window, rather than in the designated mobile pickup area. Furthermore, no prior communication was made regarding the pickup location discrepancy.In light of this experience, I would strongly encourage seeking out local coffee shops whenever feasible, as they tend to offer superior customer service. It is disheartening that, despite spending nearly $50 on coffee and sandwiches, no apologies or attempts to rectify the situation were extended. It is reasonable to expect a higher level of service given the magnitude of the purchase. It really is no surpise why the majority of the reviews at this location are one star.[Review #687]  (11th Review of 2023)
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Mar 30, 2024~I've had Starbucks all over the world and who would've thought I would have the best experience in Montgomery, AL. I stayed near this Starbucks for two weeks and my custom drink was consistently right every day, I was so pleasantly pleased and miss this store already.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Aug 24, 2022~This place is actually laughable. I ordered a chai tea latte with oat milk and I double checked three times to make sure that there was no dairy in it as I've had them put dairy in it instead and only realizing it afterwards once my stomach started hurting. I am vegan by the way. After my third time checking I'm like OK I'm sure they will make the drink right. The lady who took my order kept insisting that there was absolutely no dairy and she seem to be annoyed by me continuously asking. I take one sip of a drink as I get down the road and it taste sour, like in milk taste if you haven't had in a while, and my stomach started hurting. So I go back to the Starbucks restaurant explain what happened and now she's saying oh I thought you meant you only want a splash of oat milk. Are you serious? I can't believe, well actually I can, but still that was very upsetting! I do not trust this place and now anytime I come in I go in to make sure they're using oat milk for my drinks. They are not efficient and I do not recommend.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Mar 22, 2022~Is this the most convenient Starbucks? No. Is it large? Also no. Is it easy to park? Nope. But if you're a Starbucks nut like I am, a `"Bucky`", if you will then you'll maneuver your way through the bumpy parking lot to grab yourself a grande drink and a cookie!  The staff is friendly and tries their best, often they'll put a sign up if any drink ingredient is out of stock.
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jun 14, 2019~Great location, whenever I'm at the pep boys getting my car serviced I walk over here. Get a drink, hang out. The baristas are always friendly, I've yet to have a bad experience, unless I count the times they run out of chocolate chip cookies. Lol
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Jan 21, 2018~I just had the best experience of any of the Starbucks that I've visited in the recent past.  I was stopping thru and got off at exit 6 on I-85 in Montgomery.  This location is spacious and was very clean.  There is a good amount of sitting room, including high tables. I wanted to try something different since my seasonal favorites are gone.  The young lady, Shawn, listened to me ramble, and after giving me a few suggestions, she came up with the perfect combination for me.  She was more than hospitable when we came in and took her time in recommending a drink for me.  After I tasted it and gave it the thumbs up, she wished us a safe trip to our destination.  The extra minutes that she took to ensure that we had a positive experience and a quality beverage are appreciated!
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Oct 5, 2022~I'm not sure I would even give them a one star. I have given them multiple opportunities to get better sense this is the only Starbucks on my way to work at the hospital. They fail every time. They do not know how to make a proper drink and every single time I go to this location to order some thing, they are out. The nitro machine has been out for three months. Why can nobody run a proper business? I I thought my job as a nurse was challenging, but I guess making coffee is even worse. I would not go to this location if I were you. You're welcome in advance .
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Nov 28, 2023~has got to be the worst Starbucks in Montgomery. will randomly lock its doors because they are understaffed even if you place an online order. shut down the online ordering if that's the case.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Mar 11, 2023~We had very bad experience today at this Starbucks, aside than the fact that they were literally out of everything we wanted cookies, cake pops chocolate milk etc.. but the staff attitude was interesting as if it is normal not to have anything . We won't be coming here again for sure!
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Nov 29, 2021~This place grossed me out. I ran a business and the dots wouldn't get this bad. No toilet paper I soap .I felt like I was going to get sick here . I seriously hope not
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Jun 19, 2022~Really? Out of napkins? Should have read reviews before getting off interstate to come here.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Sep 9, 2019~This is the third time I've had a bad experience with this Starbucks. The first time the situation was resolved and it was great! Second time, different workers but always polite about the issue. This is probably the last time I'll drive to this Starbucks... even if it's only 5-10 minutes from my house. (DRIVE THROUGH) Women asked to take my order. Ordered a Trenta Dragon-drink and Venti Double Chocolate Chip Frappuccino; asked to split the double chocolate chip into two cups. The women repeated my order while I was at the menu and asked if I wanted lemon juice with it... that is where I knew she did not hear me correctly. Dragon drink (Mango Dragon Fruit, no water w/coconut milk). She put me down for a Mango Dragon Drink (which has water instead of the substation for coconut milk). I did not make a fuss about it because it happens and thought nothing of it. WAIT TIME WAS TERRIBLE! There were about 3 cars ahead of me. We sat at a standstill for about 8-10 minutes before the very first car left. Got to the window, paid for my drinks. The women proceeded to re-read my order to ensure I was the correct person that ordered. She read another drink name instead of Double Chocolate Chip... thought nothing of it and assumed it was a simple mistake so I made sure to politely say it was the DCC. Asked as well that if it could be split into two cups. She asked me kindly to hold on and gave me a look of uncertainty. A male barista came over and the women proceeded to tell him, `"This is the one who wanted it split into two cups`". He looked at me and had a bit of an attitude, responded to me saying, `"You know it's only gonna full the cup up half way, right?`". I responded and said, `"Yes that's fine`". (I've ordered a venti DCC split into two cups and an abundant amount of Starbucks. This one just tops the cake). The women gives me my drinks and I assume just like the rest of the other Starbucks, they would come in 2 Grande cups. Wrong haha he gives me 2 Venti cups... On the drive home, I'm just rerunning the situation in my head. Get home to give my husband and my kids their DCC (or so I thought). I went to taste it before giving it to my kids... IT IS COFFEE! The women that took my order got it wrong even after I had politely corrected her not once but twice. I'm home and just over the situation. My husband ends up drinking them instead. I could understand if it was a genuine mistake but for the customer to politely have to correct you twice after you've read the order back is ridiculous. I'm never one to write thorough reviews but this Starbucks is just insane. This is not the first time they've messed up my drinks. Overall, the wait time, miscommunication, and dash of attitude... it would be smart to steer clear of this location.
Montgomery, AL 36106~4~Apr 1, 2018~I've visited this location numerous times over the past few years!  Conveniently located off of eastern boulevard! The staff has always been nice and helpful! A location that won't disappoint in the Montgomery area! I'll be back for sure and the lobby area is great for meetings and relaxing on a cold day!It's also located right up the street from the park, especially since I like to indulge after my workouts Give that blonde flat white a try or for a good post workout smoothie, try the chocolate banana smoothie &amp; you can add as much protein  as you desire.
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Aug 22, 2020~They were extremely busy with drive through orders. I went inside to get my mobile order pick up, and they couldn't get my order right. I got three things in total, and after receiving each item, someone asked me `"now do you need anything else?`"  I had to tell them what items I was waiting for. Not a big deal, but not very professional on their part.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Aug 6, 2020~Extremely disappointed. Got off the interstate to grab coffee and snack and use the restroom. They have no food and you cannot use their restrooms. When I asked the guy behind said because there is a pandemic. Hmm.. really. I've been traveling (travel for work) and this is the first Starbucks I've been to that is set up this way.  For them to be so worried there was no hand sanitizer and no napkins and when I went to throw my straw paper away I saw they had their thermometer laying on the trash can counter.  Extremely disap
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Dec 23, 2019~Don't bother with this Starbucks. The staff are obviously miserable and don't seem to mind having customers wait 45+ minutes for one drink. I sat at the drive thru ordering screen for about 30 minutes before I decided to go inside. There was maybe a dozen customers in there. I've seen Starbucks much busier than that and the staff were upbeat and communicated with me. Just search for other locations nearby and go there.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Nov 22, 2019~What a mistake!  Went inside to avoid the drive through line.  Waited 20 min. For two Lattes.  The staff was busy taking care of the drive through and avoided all eye contact with customers waiting inside the store.  We were traveling through on our way East.  We will make a point of avoiding that Starbucks next time through.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Jun 21, 2021~This location is consistently terrible - The worst customer service I've ever experienced in any Starbucks, over and over again. The employees completely ignore you when you walk in and after standing at the order counter for several minutes they finally come over and still refuse to look at you or speak to you.  The Frappuccino I ordered was not mixed at all and not frozen at all.  The drink took a really long time to get and was disgusting.  Done with this location.  I'm sure it won't stay open much longer anyway. Very poorly managed. Can I leave zero stars?
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Feb 11, 2019~Love going to this location! The staff is super friendly and always happy which I love! Tonya is sweet as well! My order was messed up and she fixed it instantly with a smiling Face! For great service must visit this location!
Montgomery, AL 36106~5~Aug 2, 2018~Visited this Starbucks today with the family. The service was Excellent and all our questions were answered and there were many. We had two 7 yr olds with us and they loved their drink and food items too. Very spacious and roomy inside. Highly recommend this location.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~May 9, 2021~Don't allow for mobile in store orders if you're drive thru only. 20 min wait for cold coffee and food when we should have just been able to walk in and pickup our food.
Montgomery, AL 36106~3~Jul 11, 2019~The place is conveniently placed near the highway and the staff and products are great. The interior is also clean and relatively modern, however it was pretty quiet and the atmosphere felt a little stagnant. Great to pop in real quick but other than that I wouldn't call it a `"hangout`".
Montgomery, AL 36106~2~Jul 30, 2018~@Starbucks I order extra shots for a frap to watch what didn't fit in a cup to go down the sink. Why am I paying for product I don't get? And b/c I've reported this before (and got a refund), now I can't get my money back for product I didn't receive? Ridiculous!!!
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Dec 23, 2019~Took 45 min for my drink. Staff was slow and stood around and talked. At the end of it all my drink was wrong.
Montgomery, AL 36106~4~Dec 17, 2016~This is my second favorite Starbucks in Montgomery. (First is Zelda/Carter Hill). I think that this is the perfect Starbucks to study at. It's never too busy or loud, and the seating is nice with plenty of outlets. Sometimes the coffee isn't the best, but I just think that's because the staff is relatively new. Overall though, a very good Starbucks, and by far the best one if you are looking for some time alone to study or something like that.
Montgomery, AL 36106~1~Jan 2, 2020~This is the second time I have gone to Starbucks ,and had to wait in the drive thru line for 15 to 20 minutes.i left as soon as I could get out of the line.i left and went to the Starbucks on Vaugh Rd and it only took about 5min. to place and get my order. I dont know what's going on at this location but they SUCK!!!and I will not be going back to this location again ever!!!
Montgomery, AL 36104~5~Oct 28, 2023~Love the team here! They know my order, make me smile when I come in, and are quick! I will go out of my way to come to this Starbucks on my off days instead of other locations.
Montgomery, AL 36104~5~Dec 18, 2021~What a breath of fresh air in a time of such all around saltiness. The store is beautiful and clean and the barista and cashier were remarkable. They were genuine, friendly, and helpful.
Montgomery, AL 36104~5~Dec 29, 2021~Genuinely kind people working there.  Overly helpful.  Brightened my morning!  Great location!
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Jul 7, 2024~6- 13-248:45 AMWas in the area and stopped by here for a jolt of caffeine. When I went to order on the app was surprised as it was the first time I see a size smaller than a tall. Well I am in! Unfortunately you get less but pay what a tall used to cost. This inflation is crazy expensive! I went inside to pickup and you could have knocked me over with a feather as it was sitting there and ready. Thankful for their quick service. I saw no one so it was like people less. Took my cappuccino with me so can't really advise what it is like inside.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Mar 8, 2024~The sweetest people, the person who took my order and also the person who made my order, asked if I wanted whipped cream because I asked for soy milk you go anywhere else, usually they'll rush but not Starbucks. you can tell the managers care about there employees bc it shows !! Also was very tasty.
Montgomery, AL 36116~2~Oct 7, 2023~The service at this location is not so great. Some days the drive thru employees roll their eyes , they answer the speaker box with an attitude, and not to mention how slow they are. I ordered online today because the line was long in the drive thru and my one drink was finally ready 10 minutes after the already 10 minute time it said it would be ready and there weren't many people inside. Even on the days when the line isn't super long in the drive thru, they are still slow. I think I'll start driving down a little further to the East Chase location from now on.
Montgomery, AL 36116~2~Oct 21, 2023~Please spend some time teaching the baristas how to properly pull an espresso shot. I'm tired of bitter coffee
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Sep 17, 2022~This is the only Starbucks in Montgomery that I will go to. My order is almost always right and the wait time is not bad.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Aug 13, 2022~I'm a huge Starbucks fan. I love their drinks. I love being able to customize my beverages. They be so delicious.
Montgomery, AL 36116~3~Dec 3, 2022~7790 Vaughn Road, store is so nasty every time I go inside that I will no longer use the location!  Boxes are stacked high just inside the front door, crusty dirty stains along floor where it joins the counter - have to be months of build up.  I see spilled drinks left on the floor and crumbs, spilled milk on service counters every time I go inside.  My advice is to choose a different location.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~May 12, 2021~The Service at this location has really gone down.  I used to be able to order on my app and they would hand me my coffee when I walked in the store.  Now they won't even acknowledge my presence and I've had to leave because I was going be late to work.  The coffee tends to be lukewarm and far from hot.  When I complain they give me the money back for the undelivered items.   They promise to get management involved but nothing ever happens.Needless to say I do not patronize Starbucks anymore.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Jan 3, 2018~My Husband and I were traveling for the Holidays and decided to use our gift card a Very dear friend gave to us. We pretty much knew what we wanted and ordered in the drive thru. We were not in a hurry since the line was fairly long. Surprisingly the line moved quickly (which in my experience at Starbucks doesn't happen when the line is long)! We pulled up to the window, the attendant scanned my Birthday coupon and our card on the Starbucks app and off we went. He was super pleasant and cheerful. Definitely recommend stopping by this Starbucks if you have a chance.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Nov 27, 2022~This was the slowest and least neat Starbucks I've never been to.  In terms of quickness of ordering: after paying I waiting nearly 20 minutes for my coffee and then left without it not wanting to wait any longer. In terms of neatness: There was at least twenty drinks from mobile orders left adrift on the counter which made it impossible to determine if your drink was there or not. Although it didn't matter because after you looked through them all you would find that none of them were yours.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Apr 4, 2021~The staff was very nice and welcoming. I was very pleased with their sanitation/safety measures they were taking in between customers, and the bathrooms were clean. They were also very efficient in managing the drive through, indoor pickup, and sanitization.
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Feb 24, 2019~I was on a road trip with 2 of my kids, when I decided to splurge (aka cheat on my diet) with a fancy coffee. I had my heart set on the current special, cherry mocha. What are they out of? Cherry mocha. Ugh. I opted for my standard iced coffee, no classic, sugar free cinnamon dolce, and cream. My daughter had a triple mocha frapp and my son had a chocolate milk and a brownie. Store was clean but bathroom had a malfunctioning toilet.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Oct 18, 2019~Every time I visit this Starbucks I am given great, courteous service by friendly employees.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~May 31, 2019~So much is the same from one Starbucks to another -- it can be hard to say what makes one location stand out. But Taylor/Vaughan is a cut above. Recent renovations make it attractive and efficient, and the place is always clean and tidy. It draws a diverse crowd -- and everyone seems comfortable here. This comes down to a crew of baristas that is friendly and caring. They generally want to serve you the drink you want and to make you feel welcome. So whether you want something from the food case, a sweet cream cold brew, one of those super-colorful super-sweet special dragon-unicorn frappacinos -- or just the best short flat white in Montgomery, drop in and sit a spell. The baristas will go out of their way to make your drink right and to make you satisfied. By the way, things have improved dramatically since the remodeling. They seem to have cut away some of the dead wood. Give them a try!
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Feb 10, 2020~Unlike a couple other locations in Montgomery, this Starbucks has plenty of seating and outlets. The WiFi is reliable and the staff is friendly but respectfully quite which makes this a perfect place to work on school. As a grad student, this has become my go-to spot to get writing done. I've also NEVER had a drink made incorrectly and sometimes I have 4 or 5 mods!
Montgomery, AL 36116~2~Jul 24, 2017~This Location is one of my least favorites. I'm finding more and more issues anytime I visit this establishment. My guess is that it suffers like many businesses in Montgomery.......poor management!Today's visit ensured I would no longer use this business for coffee. Two of some popular items: Cold Brew &amp; Birthday Cake Pops were not available.  The Barista even said that they didn't have any cold brew being prepared for future use.  She made some excuse about the Cake Pops, but I couldn't  understand what she said. The Barista was not warm and friendly and lacked any customer service skills. Short of just offering a refund, she didn't even try to retain my business. Now, I know that this may not sound like an issue but I have visited this location several times and it has always been issues to include,  luke warm coffee, weak Americano Coffees and often lazy customer service.  The hot water tap was broken in a few past visits and it remained like this for several months. I complained three different times. I'm not even sure at this point if it had been fixed.  The store is usually dirty and dirty utensils lying about (very evident on today's visit) and just plain nasty. There are other Starbucks stores in Montgomery and it would have been worth the extra 2-3 mile drive down the road to the busy East-chase business.  This store is not a true depiction of the Starbucks name.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Sep 15, 2020~Love my coffee from Starbucks in the morning. They are quick to get their orders out in the drive-thru. They have a great rewards program too.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Dec 26, 2019~I normally drink Starbucks everyday but at other locations , for the simple fact every time I visit the Taylor &amp; Vaughn road location its a disappointment, I waited almost 30 minutes in the drive through to place my order because of how slow they were moving just got me to get to the window and my coffee is not what I ordered . I was polite and informed the cashier that my drink was not made correctly, he had it remade for the SECOND time for it to be still made incorrectly. I did not have a complicated order by far , I told him once again it was not correct , he gave me a look like `"oh well`" and handed me a straw , not once did he apologize or tried to offer something else . I will never return to this Starbucks location .
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Apr 4, 2019~They ran out of chocolate chip cookies :(. But the server was pleasant and polite. I think after 12pm most Starbucks run out of chocolate chip cookies. I wish they'd bring back the toffee-doodle cookies.
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Jul 4, 2013~Folks here are friendly. I'm always impressed when I do not have to explain what a London  Fog is, and they got it right. . .Yes!!
Montgomery, AL 36116~3~Feb 14, 2021~Their frappes are always watered down &amp; I had ordered a mocha frappe, but didn't even receive the drizzle? Go to the Starbucks on Chantilly. They're the best!
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Apr 24, 2020~My husband and I are moving to Orlando today after living in Montgomery for over a year and a half, and this is our favorite Starbucks in the area! We are going to miss it! Montgomery customer service overall is awful, but the employees at this Starbucks always have positive attitudes, and always get our orders right. They are amazing!! We live in East Chase but drive a little bit out of our way to go to this Starbucks because it's worth it! 10/10 would recommend.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Feb 2, 2021~Every time I come to this location my drink is made incorrectly. I tried them again, since they are so close to my work. This time they made my drink wrong three times and argued with me that the menu was wrong. Will not be going back.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Aug 30, 2020~I gave specific directions on how I would like my tea. This barista couldn't even make a simple tea with careful directions. I just left it there. It isn't rocket science. I understand you are following covid recommendations but when you are unable to satisfy a customer's request truly then stop working at customer service industry. I would never recommend this Starbucks.
Montgomery, AL 36116~3~Aug 22, 2015~Conveniently located in the Publix Shopping Ctr off Taylor &amp; Vaugn Roads, this is one of the nicer and cleaner Starbucks I've been to. It's a stand-alone building facing Vaughn Road with convenient drive-thru and pleasant outdoor patio seating.As I do with all my coffee shop reviews, I am grading this one on the following 5 qualities: 1) good, strong espresso (check); 2) availability of Cuban coffee and it turning out well (nope); 3) nice, knowledgeable baristas (check); pleasant and aesthetically pleasing locale (check); and proper utensils for espresso such as demitasse cups and spoons (nope).Therefore, this particular Starbucks earns 3 of 5 stars. My advice to management is they have to-go demitasse cups available for their espresso shots like many other Starbucks do. Serving espresso in big, cup-o-joe type cups cools the espresso too quickly.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Oct 13, 2017~I typically order through the app and come in and pick it up. Normally it's ready when I get there (I live 3 minutes away) and I haven't had any problems. Last time I went they gave me the wrong mobile order. I didn't realize it until I was down the interstate and tried to drink it. Good thing I'm not allergic to cinnamon. Anyway I came went back to the store about two hours later and told them what happened and the barista (didn't get a name) replaced my drink with no questions asked. She was kind and apologized to me for the mistake. I will keep going to this location. Plus it's always the least busiest of the Starbucks around me.
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Sep 5, 2015~Baristas are friendly and courteous. Coffee tastes on par with most other Starbucks locations.It is difficult to hear the barista through the drive-through speaker.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Mar 14, 2019~This has to be among the worst Starbucks stores I have ever visited. I visit this location often because it is the most convenient. However, they are constantly out of many items, the staff is not very friendly and they are slow. I order the same thing everyday but it may taste drastically different from one day to the next. I usually order ahead on the mobile app so I don't have to wait so long but my order is usually not ready when I get there anyway. I keep thinking it will get better but so far it hasn't.
Montgomery, AL 36116~2~Dec 31, 2019~Usually, I am a big fan of Starbucks and what they have to offer, but I believe that this location's customer service is less than par. To skip the line, I usually order through the app. Last time I went to this location, I placed a mobile order almost 20 minutes before I got to the store. When I got there, there were few customers and I actually saw my mobile ticket just sitting there and no staff noticing it. Eventually, I had to go up to the counter and they started it right away. Another time, I had a free tall drink coupon on the app, so I went to the counter and scanned it but it was not processing in the system. I tried showing the cashier my offer, but instead of the cashier helping me figure out the problem, she was very rude and kept repeating that it was not working. With that, Starbucks does offer a variety of drinks and small foods, and I would recommend it to any coffee or non-coffee lover, but I would not recommend this location.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Dec 26, 2019~Don't waste your time here. It's awful. We stopped in and ordered three standard menu items and WAITED for 35 minutes. After 25 minutes, I mentioned something to the barista and I thought she was making our drinks but instead ignored me and proceeded to make others drinks, even after she admitted the labels to my drinks never printed. I got the manager involved and she immediately made my drinks and apologized. I'll never stop at this Starbucks again. It was a disgrace to the company.
Montgomery, AL 36116~5~Jan 25, 2015~This store is always crowded but sevice is always pleasant and efficient. It has a drive thru and seating area inside and outside seating. They have a large community table - which is often doubling as a mini child care area on weekdays with regulars who bring their toddlers and carry strollers. They have a cozy lounge area with a large couch, leather seats and coffee tables. They have several small tables for two ppl - definitely taken during peak times. Oftentimes it is diffucult finding a place to seat inside. Electrical outlets are in ceilings away from reach. Baristas are friendly and know their trade - it's a treat watching how main barista takes pride in his trade hand-making and mixing teas and expressos. Place is clean and tidy.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Mar 7, 2018~So, yesterday I went through the drive thru. I went to hand my money to the woman.  My arms are not very long and I know I was reaching as far as I could.  I noticed she wasn't making much of an effort to reach any further because she was pregnant.   Which was fine, I tried to accommodate.  She obviously thought I had an issue with how far she reached because she laughed and rolled her eyes.  I thought, `" Oh, I don't want her to think I think any thing of it, so I made sure I said thank you. Which she replied, `"Yup.`"  Now I have a problem.  Enough to revisit the situation in my mind and type this. I don't want to call and complain, I don't want any one fired.  However, if you are that rude or irritable, maybe you should reconsider working the drive thru. Plus, don't assume you know what some one is thinking.
Montgomery, AL 36116~2~Dec 31, 2015~This is usually my go-to Starbucks in Montgomery but today my barista was extremely rude. She didn't greet, was short with her words and after reloading my card and ordering my drinks, she didn't give me any sign of indication that she was complete with my order. Instead she looked at me like I was an idiot and said `"you need anything else?`" So I told her I needed my receipt and she responded `"I can't print at my register, I'd have to go to the one by the drive thru.`" And that is my problem why? I'd rather have someone with better customer service and eager to work take her job. What a waste.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Oct 13, 2017~workers aren't too friendly. put in an order and after we paid they said they no longer sold Carmel macchiatos and didn't offer a refund. my least favorite Starbucks.
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Oct 15, 2016~Favorite Starbucks to shop from. I usually get bacon &amp; gouda egg sandwich and a cool, refreshing blend of juice. This location however seems to constantly be out of strawberry base and sandwiches, so I have to order something else which isn't all thaaat bad considering most things are pretty good on the menu .
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Aug 14, 2015~Friendly staff and efficient drive through. Typical good old starbucks.
Montgomery, AL 36116~4~Aug 12, 2011~It's Starbucks...hello....you can always count on the same quality &amp; consistency at ever location &amp; that's what keeps me coming back &amp; back again! Service is always attentive, fast &amp; friendly.
Montgomery, AL 36116~2~Jul 27, 2019~about half the time i go there, i have to throw away my drinks because they taste gross. it's not just my taste buds, either. my friend i was with took a sip of my drink and spit it out into a napkin because it tasted so bad. idk what it is that they do to those beans, but it's not great.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Nov 12, 2017~I ordered the peppermint mocha during their happy hour and I was very specific that I wanted frappuccinos one with and one without whipped topping. The worker repeated the order twice to me to make sure she had it correct and she did! Pulled up to the window and paid then she tried handing me hot drinks. She then continued to roll her eyes and talk to her coworker pretty loudly saying that the order wasn't incorrect and making fun of the order. Worst location in Montgomery.
Montgomery, AL 36116~1~Jan 24, 2013~At each entrance, there is a sign that says `"Starbucks is a smoke-free environment.`"  So is the outdoor seating area not part of Starbucks?  If it is, why do I see three Starbucks employees lounging and smoking RIGHT NEXT TO THE DOOR?? They also have ashtrays on three of the tables, just inviting people to blow second-hand smoke into my face, should i choose to sit outside and enjoy my Americano in the sun. No thank you.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~May 28, 2024~awful ... drink was not filled up. did not repeat my order. the girl knew she was wrong for handing me this because she just looked at me while i looked at the drink. awful!
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Jul 25, 2022~The new workers have NO customer service skill. The only saving grace is the old staff.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 3, 2021~I walked into the Starbucks this morning after placing a mobile order. Waiting patiently for my order to be prepared. I noticed that there were customers coming in after me getting their order before me. Now I know that orders are prepared in the order they are received, but my order was at the front of the counter and I was being overlooked due to certain customers that came in that looked like they had VIP status. Therefore my order wasn't as important. After maybe 8 customers came and went, they finally decided to prepare my order. Not to mention by then, my banana nut bread was cold now. Needless to say, don't be in a hurry to come to this location as you might be disappointed as I am today. This location has lost my business, I will take it elsewhere.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Oct 3, 2019~Love Starbucks. I mean who doesn't? This location is great, apparently they started putting whipped cream on the bottom and top of Frappuccinos. It's nice. I wish they'd bring back the toffeedoodle cookie. I miss it.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Jul 7, 2018~Starbucks that serves coffee and stuff.  With a drive thru.  And online ordering so it is ready when you arrive.  With friendly people.  What is not to like?
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Jan 24, 2016~This is a clean and efficient location. The staff seemed like they were helping the drive thru customers a whole lot more than the walk ins. We weren't in a hurry so it wasn't that big of a deal. The staff was friendly and my coffee was made perfectly.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Feb 29, 2020~Terrible service. Four orders in a row came out incorrectly. One barista asked if the Nitro Cold Brew was supposed to be cold after the customer returned the hot beverage.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Dec 29, 2014~Cute little starbucks with cozy Inside sofas and drive thru.  Staff is friendly and the drinks were nice.Seems like a cozy neighborhood coffee shop.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 14, 2020~I'm not sure if there's a new management at this location, but over the last 6 months or so, the employees at this location have had a really bad attitude. Not all of them, but most of them. I don't like going to this location anymore because of it.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Mar 12, 2014~The usual very good Starbucks. Quite a distance and no other choices in downtown area. Friendly staff here.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Jun 22, 2015~Starbucks is always awesome. Baristas are great. Only complaint is that the cup seal is off these days with the tall or grande cups.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Dec 10, 2012~They are so friendy there and get in you and out. Michael and David always do everything they can to take care of you. its the best location in montgomery Al.I always get great service in the store or thru the drive way. Thanks John
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Apr 28, 2019~I love this place! I'm here at least twice a week to sip and work. The staff is awesome and super helpful! The facility is always clean
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Jul 16, 2019~I received great customer service from Faith! She was so sweet and informative when I asked her questions for my future visits! I got a vanilla bean creme crap with  strawberry inclusions and it is sooo good! Definitely recommend!
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Dec 8, 2016~This Starbucks is average. I usually only go there because it's close my job but I'd pick the one in Zelda or east chase if they were closer. Don't use the re-pay mobile option. You'll ether get your coffee in 2 minutes or 25 minutes ... since I can't gamble I only use them if I have 15 minutes to spare in the morning.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Jul 18, 2015~The service is friendly and the drinks are made well, which is what you should expect from a typo a Starbucks.  However, it is very noisy here at all times.  Since the seating area isn't spread out, you'll have a lot of people right next to you having loud conversations and you have nowhere to go.  Also, the employees are pretty loud in general.  On top of all that, it's kept very hot here inside.  I've been sweating for the past two hours while doing homework, so I'm leaving for another place.  Not recommended if you want to do work or study!
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Aug 1, 2015~I miss the Starbucks I so used to love---Luke warm coffee and over priced cardboard pastries
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Jul 10, 2014~As usual Starbucks is always good. This place has good service and continues to impress me. It would be nice if the prices would drop, but majority of the time my coffee is perfecto! Of course I enjoy warning points on my mobile card app for paying with it. Starbucks changed a lot of things. I'm not addicted to them, but they're good for an occasional visit!
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Mar 10, 2013~Superior service. Friendly, efficient. Only a blow dryer in the bathroom though.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Dec 28, 2014~I really enjoy this location greatly. A majority of the workers are very personable and remember your name when you stop by. Usually pretty quick and always pleasant.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Feb 11, 2021~The wait at this location is still too long for a $5.00 cup of practically anything.  .Not much else to say except i love the Nitro
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 29, 2024~Insanely slow with terrible customer service. Restaurant and restrooms were dirty...store is barely stocked.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Oct 28, 2023~I wouldn't even give a 1 star if I didn't have to. Terrible customer service. Was ignored and they clearly saw me as they walked back and forth several times. Then they refused to give me my own receipt. Made me grab it from the printer. Pathetic and not friendly at all.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~May 29, 2023~On our way back north from a Florida vacation, we stopped by this location to use the facilities and get our Starbucks pick me up and snack before the last homestretch. Upon arriving, the restrooms were definitely in need of a freshen. That's not a huge deal, though. Just something I observed. When I placed my order of (1) drink and (2) snacks (egg bites &amp; a donut), I asked the barista to make sure the bacon Gruyère bites were still available and she said they were. I paid for my order and all was well. Sliding down the line to wait for the drink and food, I was delivered the donut and coffee, and my sister who had placed a second order received hers. Being a loyal customer of SB, I know those egg bites can take a minute so no worries. However, 10 minutes passed and still no egg bites. We were the only 2 waiting on anything inside the store at that moment. All 4 employees behind the register were working drive through and taking more in person orders, completely ignoring the only person standing at the end of the line waiting for food. 15 minutes, still nothing. So I managed to get one of their attention's and asked to check on them where she replied `"I'm not doing the food line so I don't know.`" To which I respond with `"okay, we'll... can you check on it?`" And she says `"yes.`" So I watched her fulfill a few more orders and then ask someone else about the bites. At this point I've been waiting over 20 minutes. They come back to me and ask `"what was your name again?`" And after scrolling through the orders and finding mine (Emily) - they proceed to tell me that the order was never put in for those. `"But we can ring you up for them and make them for you now.`" My reply was `"that's okay. I've already been waiting 35 minutes. I can do without them.`" I get that these things happen. The disappointment was the lack of concern and the blatant ignoring that happened during the near half hour wait. One of the baristas (wearing her Starbucks visor backwards AND upside down) walked past us at least 10 times, looking, and never even acknowledging. It was really a site. I was pretty sure I was invisible at one point. The last thing I want to mention is the state of the store itself. There weren't any napkins, boxes of food/merchandise was piled 10 feet high near the entrance, and there wasn't a single pleasant person in the place.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jan 7, 2023~If I could give them zero stars I would. Worst branch in Montgomery. Long wait and at the end the drink is not worth a dollar.  Went straight to the trash. Asked for a White Chocolate Mocha and server asked if I wanted coffee in it -- `"Mocha`"Is coffee . In the end it tasted like nothing but frothed milk , after waiting in line for about 20 min . This branch needs help!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Oct 8, 2022~mobile ordered bc I tow a teardrop. Lobby was closed and I had to wait in the drive through line - with my camper - to get to the window. WHY?!? Turn off mobile orders if you refuse to open the door.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Sep 10, 2022~Wish I had read all of the bad reviews before getting stuck in line here. Once you get in line you can't get out. They don't seem to care if they get your order right. Asked for a very small splash of cream and I got half the container. Told the drive through person it was too much and their response was just, `"sorry`" as they were handing it over. No offer to fix it. Definitely will avoid this place in the future. Waste of time and money.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 1, 2021~Disgusting. Bathrooms are gross. They're all standing around doing nothing they have plenty of time to clean a bathroom. No soap in the bathrooms. They all need retraining and need a better atmosphere overall
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Sep 9, 2021~Awful customer service. Entire store closed mid day with no explanation. Totally unreliable.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Mar 12, 2021~I sat in the line for a good 30 minutes. It was ridiculous. The car in front of me was there for about 15 minutes and you can't leave because of the way the drive thru is setup. If you're in a hurry don't go here!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Oct 19, 2019~Nasty! But service is ok ... Staff seemed preoccupied... Not sure why but the manager seems to be on top of things! The place is very busy! Hey Starbucks Corp.... help this place out! You have a good clientele.... how bout a store upgrade?
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~May 15, 2022~Wish I had seen the other reviews before we stopped here. Trash in the parking lot. A noxious music playing outside at 8 in the morning. Bathrooms were dirty and had no soap or toilet paper! We ordered a regular coffee and an iced coffee and they were terrible. Way too much cream in both and hardly any ice in the iced coffee.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Aug 12, 2022~Literally the worst starbucks in montgomery. Ive waited twenty minutes inside for an online order and they will let you just stand there without asking about your order. Just go to the chantilly starbucks a few minutes away. They are 10x better. I don't know why i keep coming here. I would give zero stars if i could.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Aug 19, 2021~Starbucks coffee is awful!  I don't know how they stay in business the way they burn their beans. I love my coffee strong but this is bitter and definitely has a burnt flavor. There's better coffee out there y'all. Take the time to go find it!!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 10, 2021~The manager Iesha was extremely rude to me . After trying to get a drink remade she asked me to pull up without asking me what the drink was or what was wrong . when I get to the window she then says well where you got it from? I informed her I worked for Starbucks for 6 years and the customer is always right . Why am I being interrogated about a drink that's full and I'm telling you it's not right .its sad the display that she's putting on for the baristas on her team . I loved this Starbucks and I come everyday . But I will find a new location .
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Apr 11, 2021~By far one of the worst Starbucks's I've ever been to.  15 minutes after we ordered the lady told us that two of their machines were down and they didn't have cold brew which is one of the drinks we ordered.The cashier was unsure how to process the refund. After 25 minutes they gave us our beverages which tasted terrible. Will never go back.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Feb 8, 2018~I have visited a fair share of Starbucks shops and this one easily has the slowest moving employees.  I visited at about 5:45 a.m. via the drive thru.  I ordered a dopio espresso with three pumps of white mocha (my own favorite concoction to get my day started).  There was only one other vehicle in front of me and it still took a good 9-10 minutes for each of us to receive our orders.  I initially figured that they could be understaffed at such an early hour; but, when I reached the window, I realized that there were three employees working.  Selfishly, I'm glad I was only in the area for a business trip and that this is not my local Starbucks.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Dec 25, 2015~The service here was very slow for the inside customers. It seems that most of their efforts are aimed at moving the traffic through the drive thru. I did enjoy the overall look of this place. They have some cool art hanging on the wall. I did appreciate that my coffee was made extra hot. The parking lot is a hot mess

Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Feb 26, 2018~Always fast and courteous, the Starbucks at Eastchase is my favorite Starbucks to frequent. They always have a large variety of baked good, Sweets, and boxed lunches to purchase if hungry. I'm really enjoying the less bitter espresso they carry now called `"blonde.`"
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Mar 19, 2022~You wait for 20-30 minutes. I understand being understaffed completely and we aren't living in an easy world right now. But if you can't properly staff your business to where it functions well, then cut hours or close until you can. I know it's tough love but waiting 20-30+ minutes is horrible. PLUS! You can't leave the line. I was 20 minutes late for work after showing up 20 minutes early in the line before. Plus I work in eastchase.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Sep 8, 2019~There's a clear reason why this location has low ratings. The drive through takes 25-30 minutes solid to get a drink. Going in isn't any better, you'll wait about the same time. Than you'll receive a drink that isn't made right and when you ask them to fix it they'll tell you it's right.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 6, 2019~Ugggg!! We always stop at StarBucks for special occasions. We've traveled literally all over continental US &amp; Europe. Always know we can depend on StarBucks for wonderful, relaxing special coffees. WRONG.  Ordered our usual Venti Cafe Mocha. Got back on the Interstate (in Montgomery AL heading towards New Orleans) before taking our first sip. UGGGGG!!!!  Day old coffee at a quick stop would have been better!!! WASTED $5 per mug!!!  Please fellow travelers &amp; StarBuck lovers -- DONT STOP HERE!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 25, 2021~Extremely long wait with 6 people in line.  25 minutes just to get the order in and could not get out of the line.  I have never been to a Starbucks this slow.  Very nice staff but not a quick location.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Jul 26, 2020~Seen hazmat suits here and no news as of what is going on. Decent service but with COVID 19 on the rise and them not being able to discuss why it looks like a scene from Monsters Inc I think I will pass moving foward.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jun 18, 2021~Just stopped in this Starbucks. The store was filthy. No napkins available. No toilet paper or soap in the women's bathroom. And a HUGE dead cockroach in the bathroom. I quietly told the person behind the counter about the cockroach, the lack of toilet paper and the lack of soap. All I got back was a disinterested `"okay.`" No I`"I am sorry.`" Oh and when I got back out to my car I discovered that they got my food order wrong. We are on a long car trip and normally I can count on Starbucks to be a quick stop with consistent product - but I will never again go to a Starbucks. They have gone downhill and are losing their brand identity.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Apr 24, 2014~This is a standard 3-star Starbucks. My venti caramel macchiato with soy milk was made correctly, but the customer service was awesome. The baristas were so upbeat. It has been a while since I stepped in a Starbuck's with this kind of energy. As a matter of fact, I always visit this Starbucks when I am in the area. Like many Yelpers have stated, the parking is crazy. I have become used to the parking because I adore this location. On a great note, it is off of I-85, so it is easy to get your drink and get back to traveling.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Feb 6, 2015~Starbucks + Clover = Greatness!Large interior is usually full of people and has the positive energy of a bustling cafe. They recently got a Clover coffee maker - brewed single-serving coffee on demand. The coffee this machine puts out will blow your mind! They grind the beans fresh when you order and space-age technology yields the best cup of coffee I've ever had. Super-friendly staff, plenty of seating, and a convenient location make this my go-to coffee fix and study spot.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Nov 2, 2020~Whoa. The place needs to be cleaned. The toilet in women's room did not work. The iced coffee was translucent, I. e., not the real Starbucks Iced coffee. YUCK
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Feb 20, 2018~My favorite PokémonGo playing spot. Oh yea and the coffee is cool . The main downside about this Starbucks is that I dont think they anticipated it to be so popular or busy. The parking can be horrible/hazardous depending on the time of day/night. And of course the traffic is ridiculous during the morning and evening rush. I'm not really sure if this is Starbucks' fault or Eastchase's. I know people sometimes park in the chick-fil-a parking lot or another neighboring restaurant and walk over. But because there are no sidewalks or crosswalks it could be potentially dangerous. I really wish Montgomery would get it together and allow the city to be a little more metropolitan with a southern flair. But this Starbucks location is great, really close to the interstate and great shops. The staff is usually friendly, there's always at least one person who may be having a bad day. But hey, we're human. I've only had my order messed up about 5 times from all the years I've been coming to this one.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 28, 2019~Stuck in the drive through circle again for 20 minutes ...... it should take this long to make coffee!! Outrageous! People are getting out carrying their kids inside to use the restroom since they're also stuck in the circle! Don't do what I did and think they have their shit together! They don't!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Dec 10, 2018~Accidentally came to this location again! They have one bar open which they placed with in the drive thru circle which doesn't allow you to leave it once another car is behind you. Therefore, I am once again stuck in this circle of hell! Why not place a sign before people are in the circle? Bad management! I see they are rated so low! Please don't come to this location, you'll regret it!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 18, 2018~At Starbucks at 3:59 and get told they are out of white chocolate mochas the most basic drink... and have to sit and wait for a huge van since I can't go around! Will never visit this location again!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Mar 22, 2019~Omgeeeeeee this is the worst Starbucks that I've ever been to!! It took them like 5mins to come to the register to take my order. He got my order wrong also it took another 25 mins for me to get a drink, 2 danish and a sandwich! Smh everyone inside was complaining and they acted as if they didn't even care!! I wish I could give them no stars at all!!!
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Feb 25, 2018~If you are looking for a chill place to hang out and read or chat with a friend this place is NOT it. The music is blaring. The inside of the facility is showing its age and there is not much seating. They lost my drink order today as well. The only redeeming quality was that as soon as I brought it to their attention they got me my drink pretty quickly. If I come back here it would only be for going through the drive thru. Oh never mind, I just read some other reviews and found out the drive thru sucks too!
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Nov 24, 2017~Very friendly Starbucks staff. Currently only 8 Starbucks are designed with a round bar &amp; mobile pickup counter in the middle. The Starbucks designer is no longer employed . We purchased 2 reduced fat turkey bacon egg white sandwiches. He said tasted like made from scratch. Also purchased a Grande Americano with Steam , it was good also. The bathrooms were clean &amp; parking was ample.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 23, 2020~I know it's covid  times but how hard is it to have clean toilets and paper towels in the bathrooms... how hard is it to have clean floors.... and HOW HARD IS IT to get me one cup of coffee within 15 minutes??????  AND WHY ARE YOU GRABBING THE COFFEE CUP WITH THE  YOUR FINGERS FROM THE INSIDE OF THE CUP????? Never coming back to this Starbucks again.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Nov 23, 2020~After getting having my vehicle hit in the parking lot and failing a final exam, I pulled up to get a pick-up for another long night of studying. To my astonishment, one of the store managers, KC, gave me a free nitro cold brew on the house. It's little things like this that make a huge difference, especially for a doctoral student with student loans that'll take years to pay back, and every dollar counts. Next time I go through I plan on paying it forward and paying for the vehicle behind me. Months ago, I couldn't stand the service at this Starbucks. They've made plenty of improvements since!!
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Sep 19, 2018~This is by far the best Starbucks I've been to, the staff is supper friendly, and a young man that goes by the name Tanner is a very busy (always running around)The only problem I see currently after visiting more then a handful of times is the fact that the night shift he works is understaffed, and It gets beyond busy some nights. Customers get rude but Tanner keeps his composure very well, The crew he works with struggles some nights, and I do wish this changes for the better.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Mar 13, 2013~This parking lot is a nightmare. The layout is completely bonkers. I was about to leave, but luckily found a spot. The atmosphere was pretty typically for most Starbucks. Not a lot of study tables. The store section with mugs and such was fairly disorganized and not well stocked.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Aug 6, 2019~Horrible COFFEE! old and full of grounds. Are you kidding me Starbucks. I am a fan but will not be back to this location ever.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Dec 22, 2012~Drive thru people.Everything you would expect from a Starbucks here.  Top quality.The parking can be a fustercluck when crowded though.Personal note, this is where I met fellow Yelper Holli D. IRL.  Yelp makes the world a little bit smaller :)
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 9, 2020~It's amazing they closed the bathrooms, like COVID 19 makes you not have to go!!  I'll be buying my coffee on trips somewhere else!!
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~May 22, 2011~Reliable Starbucks is right here in East Chase. No complaints, just a suggestion about moving the tables and chairs around to make it a little more comfy and homey. The lounge chairs outside are great too...need to rearrange them for a better feel. I'll come over and do it for you if you need help :-)
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Feb 26, 2017~Five cars in line at the drive through, it took 27 minutes to get my drink. Sooo sloowwwww.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Jan 3, 2020~Subpar service with my subpar drink. Their lack luster staff were rude with me over my first order because I made a mistake of not knowing about coffee which is apparently holds the utmost importance to the universe's stability, or so they think. I genuinely understand dealing with difficult people, but instead of attempting to help their customers they were incapable of being patient enough to help me in finding a decent cup of coffee which is the only purpose of their corporations existence. I however do not believe the staff is solely to blame because Starbuck's coffee is bland and lacks the ability to stimulate any sense other than `"bleh!`" In writing this review I realize the truest mistake was my choice in coffee places.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jan 14, 2017~Too crowed! We got stuck in the drive through line have no choice and can't turn around. Not worth the wait.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Jan 15, 2017~Beware ordering a pour over. Or keep reminding them. I stood there for ten minutes before I asked if they had my pour over that I was told would take three minutes. The barista then just started to look for the beans. I asked if she was doing the pour over, she said she was just fixing to start it now. No thanks, just give me whatever you have ready, cuz I can't wait another ten minutes (commuting home with dogs in the car). Ridiculous.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Oct 5, 2019~Ridiculously slow... and no way to leave once in line. So don't get caught in the drive thru trap unless you've got a good 20 minutes to wait
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Mar 28, 2014~The morning rush and kick start, nice folks, quick coffee it works.It is next to some very busy fast food establishments so parking can get a little crazy but I manage.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Mar 11, 2017~On a roadtrip &amp; had to wait over 30 minutes stuck in drive thru with 5 cars.  3 people working inside &amp; it was dead inside. Such slow service.  Then the order was wrong when we got to the window.  I could hear them constantly talking as we were waiting for them to fix the order.  We travel to many Starbucks over the US &amp; never seen one take so long.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Feb 4, 2017~Terrible. Every time I go there and order they are alway `"out`" of every sandwich I order. And I refuse to just order whatever they have. I want what I want! Overpriced. Not worth the money or time waiting in line
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Aug 11, 2019~This is the best Starbucks I have been to! They made my coffee just as quick as how long is took to order it a the register. All the workers have genuine smiles on their faces and really go out of there way to help you if you are indecisive! They even spell names right here! One of the employees in particular who made my coffee (honestly, the best caramel macchiato I have ever had!), Kayla, didn't just put my coffee down say my name and started on her next drink. She made sure it made it right in to my hands and delivered it with the biggest smile. I wouldn't expect such an experience but boy was it refreshing! Thank you to all the Starbucks employees for your service! Would recommend everyone to check it out, and give these motivated people a raise! They deserve it!
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Dec 23, 2018~Accidentally wrote a review for the target location down the street from this one...To some it up, Came in Sunday Morning 23 December 2018, Appearance NASTY, front door, first foot in the door trash NASTY with 8employees behind the counter..Bottom Line Up Front..Manager needs to care
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jun 26, 2019~This Starbucks is terrible. There are boxes all over the lobby. They forgot my friends drink and never even apologized. The bathroom is filthy and smells.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~May 9, 2017~I'm not sure why I am even bothering with this review....Star Bucks is too big of a chain and they make LOTS of money off of people like me even when I'm complaining, so why would they make any adjustments to the way they do business when bad customer service and `"okay`" tasting coffee makes them millions. Nonetheless I rated this place as 2-star because it doesn't matter what time of the day or what day of the week it is, you will still wait....and wait...and wait for your coffee. So if you have a lot of free time, then this is the place for you. It's in the East Chase shopping center so it can be very busy in the parking lot. And speaking of parking lots, it is the most convoluted parking lot I've ever seen. Be wary of other vehicles trying to maneuver their way around. They have a nice outdoor area...however if you like the smell of car exhaust then take a seat. The drive through loops around right by the outdoor seating. Boo. This is a smaller than average place and seating is very limited. Would recommend getting your coffee to go. Enjoy!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Oct 29, 2018~Traveling through Montgomery with my family. We pulled through for an afternoon treat. When taking my order, the  lady was very rude and `"bothered`" like I was taking too much of her time. They were out of chocolate croissants. Okay...no big deal...I can order something else. I placed 5 drink orders. It took nearly 20 minutes to get our drinks. The blonde flat white was basically water with milk added in. I had to pour it out. What a waste of money!! I should have trusted the 3* reviews before we came here. Besides the order being poorly made, the lady at the window barely made eye contact and was clearly not happy about being at work today. Then don't show up! If I acted this way at my job, I wouldn't get to stay long. We pass this way often, but won't be visiting this Starbucks again. It's a shame.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Mar 13, 2019~I frequent many Starbucks locations while traveling. This location is mediocre. The drinks are OK, service is decent. But the inside areas are always dirty. Napkins and straw wrappers on all over the place. Trash is generally overflowing. Not where I would want to spend time working and enjoying coffee. Staff always seem more concerned with hanging out with each other than cleaning up. Every other Starbucks I have been in will usually have associates cleaning when there are no customers.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 20, 2018~SLOWEST STARBUCKS EVER. Unbelievably long lines in drive thru, takes forever to get order. The location is clearly short staffed, which makes no sense since it is very busy. I hope someone wakes up and properly staffs this location, as it is very conveniently located.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jan 13, 2019~I just waited in the drive through for 30 minutes. By far the worst Starbucks experience ever!
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Jan 31, 2010~Typical starbucks.  Can be crowded at times due to location next to Eastchase.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~May 2, 2015~Its always nice to find a Starbucks wen you need it and this place was very easy to get into their drive through and get our drinks. Easy in and out.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Mar 12, 2016~Just waited in the drive thru line for 20+ minutes. Starbucks is some of the best coffee around but not worth the wait and no apology from the drive thru attendant. I have only tried this Starbucks one time but am hesitant to go back. The Smoked butterscotch latte and iced Americano tasted watered down.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Sep 14, 2015~Last night on the way home from Auburn to Pensacola I stopped at Starbucks drive-through to grab something to lift me up for my long drive. I spent 30 minutes in line I use the app to order my drink.  Horrible horrible place to do a drive through and lose 30 minutes of your time when you're trying to get somewhere. The girl at the window said they were shorthanded while I was trying to call the store to find out why the line was so backed up and no one would even answer the phone.  it looks like whatever management that supposed to be at the store has left the building. Once in line there is no escape.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jul 11, 2020~Go through the drive through and pay with credit card. Employee forgets to hand back my card. No big deal I noticed right away but had already left the parking lot. So I circle around and walk back into the store. Inside service was limited to just 1 person it was just me and Starbuck employees. I asked for my credit card, their response was `" we don't have any credit cards`". They challenged me on how long was that you left it here. My response about 5 minutes ago. Nobody really stopped to look for it. After refusing to leave they find it and the employee walks over to me. He says here it is and I ask is there anything you would like to say. He looked totally confused, no sorry we didnt give you your card back or sorry for the inconvenience or sorry we called you a liar. Clueless customer service, everyone makes mistakes no big deal but you step up. Once again substandard service from a clueless company.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Mar 26, 2020~This used to be my go to location when I wanted Starbucks, but recently the service has been absolute trash. On more than one occasion I've had to wait an excessive amount of time to get my coffee. By excessive amount of time I mean longer than 30 minutes for a single Frappuccino. On one occasion I even placed a mobile order which said would take 10 minutes. After arriving at the store roughly 8 minutes after placing the order I still ended up waiting another 35 minutes. The staff did not appear to be making drinks with any urgency, instead they seemed to be moving at a quite leisurely pace taking extra time in between making drinks to chat (and from what I could hear the conversations had nothing to do with how to make any of the drinks or anything. The morning shift seems to be somewhat quicker, and by somewhat I mean I only have to wait 15-20 minutes for a drink instead of 30-40. I've even witnessed on occasion staff members berating another staff member while that staff member was trying to help a customer. The only time I will go back to this one is if I'm just really craving a Starbucks drink while I'm near this store, and even then I might just drive the extra distance to either the Taylor Rd. location or the Atlanta Hwy. location.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Sep 8, 2017~I ordered 6 cups of coffee yesterday for a client. 3 of them were wrong and needed to be remade. It was supposed to be a cafe vanilla frapacinno and it was a vanilla bean frap. No big deal. One of the staff seemed upset that 3 coffees needed to be remade and walked up towards me to take the 3 cups away. Not a big deal except The vibe I got from him was unpleasant, that I was lying and was trying to get free coffee because he didn't say I'll take this away, he just took it from my tray without no apologies. I mean. Come on. Do I look like a piece of . I don't need a free drink. Apologize for making the mistake and treat me the customer, someone that pays over $150 every month at your establishment with more respect.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Apr 16, 2013~My mom is a coffee whore. Actually, she's just a starbucks whore. You think I'm kidding? The staff knows her drink and often makes sure that her drink is made right because otherwise they'll get the wrath from her. And trust me, it's happened plenty of times before. This location is convenient and super close to my house and all the shopping when I'm home. I love that they have drive-thru and the drinks made here are generally good and not sloppy. It's probably my favorite Sbucks to go to anywhere.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Jul 28, 2011~It's Starbucks.....you always know what to expect, quality of drinks the same. The baristas are nice &amp; attentive. This Starbucks stays busy!
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Oct 11, 2014~9 at night with a nice crowd on the patio. Drive thru was quick and the man behind the curtain was helpful and friendly. The only coffee they had was medium roast so I got a shot of espresso added to it. Coffee was fresh. Giving 3 stars to be neutral as I did not experience this Starbucks when crowded nor go inside.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Oct 11, 2009~Unfortunately, there is no other place around the area to get good coffee/espresso drinks.  Fortunately, there is Starbucks.  I love my caffeine, therefore I love Starbucks--- especially the one 2 minutes from my house.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Dec 10, 2015~Would be a great location if the service was a little faster I consistently have to wait 30 minutes in line before ordering
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~May 6, 2017~I don't write a lot of reviews. But I'm traveling north on I85 and need to grab coffee... quick. It took them 15 minutes to get me my venti coffeee. The guy Chris who started the preset literally left the cup on the counter and went on break while I waited.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Apr 21, 2011~Starbucks is what it is, one of the most widely known coffee venues, and while the staff is friendly and the coffee is good, the best part are the refills... gotta have caffiene! Been Gold since 2007 and will be for a long time to come!
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Oct 20, 2015~The Uganda Sippi Valley coffee was silky smooth, light, floral, and aromatic. My new fave. Customer service is great here. Stand alone store located in a busy shopping district.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Mar 19, 2017~Took over 30 minutes to make me a French press after I ordered.  They apologized and comped my purchase after it was finished.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 1, 2013~Come on....melted whip...melted frapp....you can do better than that.....and a dead pan glare from the drive thru guy when you question the icky glop on top of a $4.50 frapp....disappointed...
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Jul 12, 2017~Place was not clean. Floor needed cleaning , no cream for coffee, no napkins and not one smiling face behind counter. Coffee was good.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Feb 16, 2011~12 Feb 2011 at 3pm.  The guy working here needs more training or needs to be replaced.  He has messed up 3 orders since I been here.  It also takes 20 minutes to get your coffee. This place is making the customers angry.  My java chip was good but my wifes caramel macciato was bitter, as if no sugar was added. Probably won't come to this one again.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Nov 14, 2015~This location is one of the slower locations I've been to...be patient and prepared for a wait.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Mar 11, 2017~Every time I go to this location they are extremely slow. There are always 7 or more vehicles in the drive through waiting. Last 2 times I came here is was  more than a 20 minute wait in the drive through. Im not sure what people are ordering that should take so long to prepare. The bad thing about this location is you cannot escape the drive through if you needed to leave for any reason
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 27, 2017~I've never written a review before but this service was so terrible I needed to warn others. My husband and I go to Starbucks almost everyday and get the same drink. This location in Eastchase is hands down the WORST Starbucks I've ever visited. I've given them several opportunities but am let down every time. My two most recent experiences are the deal breakers. About a week ago we went and ordered a Venti caramel mocha frappuccino, my husbands typical drink, and the drink we were handed after a 30 minutes wait in the drive through was white. I told the cashier that this was not the correct drink and she immediately got and attitude and threw her hand out like `"what do you even mean`" and was angry she had to remake it. After this experience I gave them one more attempt and yet again long wait, TERRIBLE customer service, under-trained staff, and WRONG drinks again, and an attitude when asked for the corrected beverage. Never again. I've been to every other location in Montgomery and never had any issues. I will go MILES out of my way to go to another location before returning to this establishment.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Jan 20, 2016~Second time this week I've come with only 3 cars in the drive-through, and I've waited for more than 15 minutes. This location has slowly become much slower!!
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Jun 18, 2011~This is a nice Starbucks, with friendly service and lots of room to read, study or hang out with friends. Not the most convenient stores due to the street layout, and the parking lot/drive thru can seem challenging to negotiate. Otherwise, it's in a good location.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Jun 7, 2014~If you make my coffee wrong and then claim that I don't know what I am talking about that us just crap. I won't be back.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 9, 2016~this starbucks has the slowest service of all the starbucks in Montgomery, and the most inconsistency in drinks... I always go with my girlfriend and we order the same coffee no special instructions (venti caramel ice coffee with cream and classic) and without fail they come out 2 totally different drinks its almost as if they want to see how different they can make the same drink look and never have they been able to duplicate my drink on a refill
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Dec 28, 2014~It seems the large customer service counter has been replaced by a Starbucks in this Target store. The customer service center is small now and not in the location you might expect in a target store.That being said, I would never complain about making room anywhere for a Starbucks counter. This Starbucks could use more training. Batista was not super helpful in guiding my mom to a drink she might enjoy. She was not happy with the drink, but I enjoyed mine. I'm a Starbucks regular, so I have my favs. Otherwise the store was fine.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Feb 18, 2018~Update your hours so that we do not walk into target and see that you are closed. It was Sunday 11:30 am. Would have been nice. We went across the street to a stand alone Starbucks.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Sep 5, 2016~I'm a Starbucks regular and honestly, do yourself a favor and drive over to the Starbucks at the front of Eastchase. The service at the Target location is just rude enough to make your latte taste bad.
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Dec 23, 2018~Came in Sunday morning , 23 December 2018 to what I counted was 8 employees. Restaurant appearance from out side the front to the trash on the floor stepping in was HORRIBLE..You had conversations going on about everything, people standing around, like WTH! Yelp should have video, my words aren't doing the justice needed.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~May 14, 2015~So I never knew that they had happy hour for frappachino. The guy on the intercom let us know and was cool about it too. So both the wife and I got one. Love it that we can get drinks for cheaper then usual. Nice location and clean.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Apr 11, 2024~I ordered an iced lavender cream oat milk matcha drink and this is what I received. I asked the barista if this was the correct drink because of the lack of color and he assured me it was correct. It tasted like dirt water with a hint of coffee. I then went to the Starbucks at East Chase and received the correct drink.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Aug 29, 2024~This is the FRIENDLIEST Starbucks I have ever been in!  I PRAY THEY ARE PAID WELL!  Great customer service!  They were moving fast to get things done!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Nov 7, 2024~by far one of the worst starbucks i've ever visited..... i asked for simply a carmel ribbon crunch no whip ex carmel ex crunch.... 1st attempt bottom of the cup full of whip... 2nd attempt no ex carmel no ex crunch and milk was sitting at the top of my cup 3rd attempt the worker was just being a a**h*** and filled the bottom of the cup with so much caramel i could even drink it threw the straw starbucks is not cheap so i want what i paid for but ill never go to that one again
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Jun 25, 2024~Robert is great for genuine hospitality, but all the staff are friendly, the food and drink are well executed, and the location is not bad at all. So why not 4-5 stars? The big downer at this location is the music! Bang!, bang!, bang! ...loud brain-shattering drums all day long! This is the worst location I've ever known for sound. It may be good for dancing, but it does not allow any peaceful thinking, reading, or talking. It's torture! They may do that for the workers (whom I've seen dancing while working) but that is not right: they should make it good for customers. I tend to flee to the terrace, which is less acoustically oppressive, but summers in Alabama are too hot for that. If they ever change this problem, I'll be happy to give it a better review.
Montgomery, AL 36117~3~Sep 4, 2023~This location isn't as consistent as we hoped. Our first visit a few years ago was great and every single visit since then has been trending down hill. Our order has been wrong a few times or completely forgotten. We've had to remind them about our drinks we had already paid for or they call your name for part of your order, then forget to announce the rest of your order.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Apr 22, 2024~Both morning crew and night crew don't seem to know how to make a drink correctly at all. The drink always tastes watered down or too milky. The baristas must not have trained well enough to know the correct pumps for each drink. Their customer service is not friendly and inviting. The baristas hold a unprofessional attitude even if this is just a coffee shop. The only things you can trust to order from this particular location is food and that's because they don't actually make it.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Dec 28, 2022~This was not the best experience at this location. Spent over 20 minutes stuck in drive-thru, waiting for service, and then when I did my drink was awful. The staff wasn't even apologetic about anything.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~May 31, 2024~service was good. coffees were made perfectly. Ll the staff members are very friendly
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Sep 23, 2023~They give you the complete opposite of what you order. Not returning to this location. Too many times I have had to reorder a simple drink order
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Apr 7, 2022~My mom and I stopped here on our drive down to FL and we had some of the best Starbucks drinks we've had in awhile. The baristas were super friendly (they even gave us pup cups for our two dogs!), and the inside of the Starbucks was super clean with plenty of seating.
Montgomery, AL 36117~4~Sep 4, 2021~It's great to have a Starbucks near me! The staff is friendly and they wear mask. Seating is limited inside, but you are allowed in. There's also outside seating as well. The building is brand new, so it has a modern interior like most new Starbucks. My negatives are the same as every Starbucks, every time I fall in love with a menu item it gets taken off or it's just seasonal. No snickerdoodle cookies, no everything bagel bites, no more peach teas .
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Jan 1, 2021~Service was straightforward and very nice. However they 1. Didnt have cold brew. 2. Iced Americano was very grainy and bitter.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Oct 19, 2021~Tooooo slow! Had only 1 register open during the morning rush. Really? Waited &amp; waited... customer had problem with a coupon... they never opened another register to help the customers who didn't have issues. Finally left empty handed &amp; disappointed. Not returning
Montgomery, AL 36117~2~Dec 18, 2021~Great location. Worst service ever. Every. Time. Wrong orders. Missing items. Watery drinks. Staff walking away when you're mid sentence ordering. Close at random times. Unreliable. Claim to be short staffed but also turn away anyone who tries to apply or inquire about work.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Jul 23, 2021~Our 2 years old daughter is the biggest fan of their cake pops. We went to Zelda location today but they were out of cake pops. BF called East chase location then but they just sold out of them. So he called this location to make sure they have some cake pops, the guy he spoke to was the nicest. When we went to the drive through window, he greeted us so nicely and gave free cake pops to our daughter because we had to drive far! The best service and so friendly! Our daughter couldn't be happier!
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Dec 29, 2022~I went there with 3 other people two ordered a hot chocolate and 2 ordered coffee and cake pops they told us they were out of cake pops and somehow they came up with the five we ordered they didn't have our drinks ready and we ordered 30 minutes ago they didn't put any I mean any Carmel or whipped cream in au of our drinks I do not recommend going to them on Wednesday during 12-3:00 cause service was horrible then she got an attitude with us when we ask for a refund
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~May 8, 2022~This particular Starbucks turns the `"order ahead`" feature off much too often.  In my humble opinion there should not be an option to turn it off.  Never experienced this until I moved to Montgomery.  Most employees do not have a sense of urgency, rather, you're presented with a `"I'll get to it when I can`" sort of demeanor.
Montgomery, AL 36117~1~Feb 15, 2021~So slow. I went at the most random time around 4:30 in the afternoon, sat in line for 30minutes. Food and drinks were good but that wait is insane.
Montgomery, AL 36117~5~Dec 29, 2020~Great staff and perfect experiences every time I visit! Thank you Chantilly Starbucks
Hope Hull, AL 36043~5~Apr 18, 2024~This is my absolute favorite Starbucks in Alabama. Always quick with great service in order is always on point. Great management at this store.
Hope Hull, AL 36043~3~Dec 4, 2024~Third time coming through here (in about a month) one to two hours before close and all the outside lights are off (each time I've gone). (Taco Bell isn't even open yet right next to it and their lights are on). Nothing except the safety lights are on. Each of these three times the cashier has handed me the scanner instead of taking my card expecting a tip, `"it's gonna ask you a question`". But they're turning the lights off (or not turning them on) making costumers who aren't local think they're not open. It's literally a safety concern not to mention a work ethic issue.The coffee always tastes good and the people are nice. It just burns me up with people try to pull one over on the costumers.
Hope Hull, AL 36043~5~Feb 20, 2024~The barista ladies at this Starbucks are fast and serving up delicious drinks. I picked up the best, creamiest, caramel ribbon crunch. So delicious! Clean location, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating if you plan to stay awhile.
Hope Hull, AL 36043~1~Sep 21, 2024~I food hair in my drink and the people are always rude. I went in this time and the bathroom was horrible.
Hope Hull, AL 36043~5~Jan 1, 2024~This is one of our traditional stops on our way to Florida. The staff is phenomenal. Everyone makes you feel welcome. The drinks and food are served efficiently. Always clean whether it's the bathrooms or the entire storefront. They great you with a smile and acknowledge you when you leave. All other Starbucks should take note!
Hope Hull, AL 36043~2~Jul 27, 2024~I have been ordering the same coffee product for 20 years. I have gotten it all over the country and it always tastes the same. Then last week I ordered that same drink for the 20th time at this location. What I got was completely unblended, watered down mess. I should have known something was wrong when it was sitting on the drive through window when I got there. There is no point in stopping at this place any longer if they cant fix a simple drink correctly. You can do better. I am not going to lower my standards for you.
Hope Hull, AL 36043~3~Dec 16, 2022~Be prepared to wait... in both the drive thru and in store.Employees working fast but not enough help.They got our order wrong but had no problem fixing it when we point it out to them.Parking lot is large and there is room on the back street to park when towing an RV.Beverages made correctly.
Hope Hull, AL 36043~5~Feb 9, 2024~Great service. Product as expected but. Clean, friendly staff..................good display of retail items
Hope Hull, AL 36043~1~Oct 1, 2023~So they have some sort ofCrap where they can't use their venti cups for the people in the lobby only for mobile orders . What kind of crap isThis. ? The most ridiculous Starbucks ever . Don't stop here . It's a waste of time . Second time stopping here and every time it's an issue .
Hope Hull, AL 36043~5~Nov 17, 2021~I am thanking for their staff for their support of me. I am grateful to their customers and my great coffee each morning. Thanks again for your support and for your polite manners. I can appreciate the hard work done at the Yonge and Holly Street. JP
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Sep 1, 2024~This location is dirty. I witnessed an employee empty the trash and hand half filled cups to an employee that was fixing drinks to discard the old trashed liquid in the clean reservoir. No gloves. I asked for a refund when the employee started to fix my drink without washing her hands after dealing with trash. She had an attitude and said whatever the manager has to do it. The manager, who also had an attitude, charged me for 2 more drinks instead of issuing a refund. When I confronted her about not giving me a refund but instead charging me again she said this register can not do refunds I have to do it on the other register. She knew that she had recharged me instead of giving a refund. I did get double refunded but only after the manger thought she could trick me.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~May 18, 2024~Most of the Starbucks I've been in reasonably have it together and work together to chuck out the beans but this one has an attitude problem. No one is talking, there's no working together, just angry people making mistakes because they don't want to be doing what they're doing. We paid for our drinks and waited over 15 minutes till we finally just walked out. We watched drinks being remade and angry little souls spouting they're about to walk out while making drinks. Management needs to step in and fix this one. There were alot of people in here overspending for coffee and everyone was waiting, maybe 25-30. Not good Starbucks, do you even know you have a problem??  Side note, the restroom was atrocious.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~May 29, 2023~The management team really needs to work on scheduling and efficiency. I've been here in the morning and the afternoon and there is always a really long wait. The weekday mornings after 8:30am are decent, but weekends, early mornings, and holiday afternoons and absolutely awful with wait times. I tend to go to the Starbucks downtown because of the wait time. That Starbucks has less people and are way more efficient with their time. Positive thing is the people they have working here lately are pleasant and polite.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~May 7, 2024~Horrible wait.  Waited and then they forgot my ice water.  I complained about the wait and the boy at the drive thru said for get the ice water.  I told him I was not leaving without it.  He said have a good day.  He was so rude.  He asked me for an apology but I asked if he was going to give one to me for the wait...nothing.  Tuesday5/7 1:30pm.  Cons Ford
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Jun 5, 2024~Absolutely appalling lack of customer service at this location. My order had been messed up today and I politely asked if they could remake my coffee (tasted like burnt chemicals) and the girl gave me a huge sarcastic attitude, rolled her eyes at me and proceeded to laugh in my face when I inquired about the rest of my order that was. Mind you, there was no one else in there and they were not busy so it's not like I was rushing them or bothering anyone (also not to mention it was ready until 45 minutes after I placed the order but not even worried about that part...)She told me someone else had came in and walked out with my order but refused to make me another or refund my money????I work in the same shopping center as this location, get coffee and breakfast almost every day I work (5-6 days a week), always leave a tip, and have never had any issues until today. I work in customer service as well so totally get being burnt out/having a bad day but no excuse for the attitude and total lack of professionalism from the employee(s) today. Do better.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Jun 19, 2020~When you've been to one Starbucks, you've been to them all. Well, except for maybe Seattle locations. But that's besides the point. We were traveling and it was happy hour. I searched for the nearest Starbucks along the route, and this one came up. We navigate here and had an easy time of locating, and it was pretty easy to get back on the interstate once we were done. I was worried about the line/wait time because of the special, but surprisingly, there wasn't one at all! Our drinks were out and accurate in no time and we were back on the road. Would stop here again if I'm in the area!
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Jan 16, 2021~Very convenient location. Right off I-65 and roughly half way between Destin, FL and Nashvile, TN. Like a lot that the store is dedicated to the people who serve our country. Appears to be cleaner that other Starbucks stores. It's hard to say why, but the worst choice is to walk to the store. Line wasn't long to order, but we had to wait for ever to get our coffee orders. The quality of the coffee is the same as everywhere - Starbucks standard.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Dec 24, 2022~Worst Starbucks I've ever been to. Always takes 30-45 min to get a drink. Ordering ahead is a joke. It seems like they are always understaffed.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Oct 19, 2023~It's exactly what you would expect going to the busiest Starbucks in the state of Alabama. It takes a long time to get through the line and get a drink it's not the fault of the staff the store is not Designed to handle the volume of customers it has
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Jan 4, 2023~Nothing special I personally haven't experienced a lot of what the other reviews are on about so I can't speak on that but I mean the drinks are Starbucks they can be good they can be bad. I've never ordered from online but every-time I order through drive thru the people were really nice and had a great attitude. I almost never get coffee though I always get the fruity drinks tbh.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Oct 2, 2022~worst Starbucks I've ever been to. I do mobile order and give them so much time to prepare the order. always an extra 10-20 mins, for something simple, like an iced tea! Who is managing this Starbucks?? they need to do better....and organize their team better. Ive never had a drink come out on time here. drive through is always backed up too.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Dec 31, 2022~Worst experience EVER at Starbucks.*Store was completely trashed!!! Like health department needs called trashed. *There was 9 people behind the counter, 1 or 2 who looked to be actually working.*Waited 20+ minutes for 1 drink*Foam was running all down the sides of my Venti cup*Only had dome lids with small straws!!!!*Worst coffee I have ever had!!!*Charged $.80 for drizzle. It was literally a dot!The employees were very unprofessional behaviorally and appearance.Not a good representation of what Starbucks is. Close this location before someone gets sick from the dirtiness. Clean it, retrain the staff and start over.Yuck!
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Dec 30, 2022~Waited almost an hour on a toasted white chocolate coffee my sandwich got cold and there weren't but only 5 people ahead of me. Longest time I've ever been in a Starbucks by far. definitely not satisfied.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Jul 9, 2022~Absolutely the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. I placed a mobile order for a cold brew and muffin. When I got there I didn't see my drink or muffin up yet. They let me wait (only person waiting at the pickup area) for 15 mins before calling my name just to say they don't have cold brew at 7:30am. What? They had been taking inside orders and making drinks while I had been standing there. I had to go back out to get my phone for my car for a refund. When I walked back in they wanted me to wait inline for a refund which was 10 plus people long. I stated I just needed a refund though. The employee called me out in front of everyone saying yes, please cut in front of everyone in line. I was so embarrassed when my order had been placed 20 mins ago at this point. I won't let anyone belittle me like that though. I kindly responded back please don't phrase it like that. You had me waiting 15 mins before calling my name to say you couldn't make my drink. I'll be sure to avoid this location when passing on vacation. Your employees are awful!
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Jul 25, 2021~How can you road trip without Starbucks? Stopping 2 hours into our 12 hour road trip here sounded like a good idea--it's almost right off the highway. We ordered our drinks at 1136 and didn't get them till 1204. There was a ton of people working but only a couple of them were doing anything. The longer we were there the more people accumulated. Starbucks shouldn't take 30 minutes to get drinks when you order inside. Especially when people in the drive through are getting drinks faster. I am VERY disappointed with this Starbucks. This town ate our time. Should have taken 5-10 minutes to get Starbucks...not a half hour. Only reason it gets 2 stars instead of one is my drink was at least made right ‍ my friends was not...given regular coffee instead of cold brew.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Mar 28, 2022~I do mobile order. My drink is always ready when I get there, which is nice, but then I still have  to stand there and wait to get a straw. Keeping the straws behind the counter is baffling. But, if you're going to be this protective of your straws, then train the staff the quickly acknowledge someone standing at the mobile order pick up with their drink on hand.  I realize employees are busy. I don't want to bother them, but if you're going to force me to ask for a straw, please don't look at me like I'm bothering you when I say `"excuse me`"  I don't want to stand there for 5 mins or more just to get a straw.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Mar 25, 2021~Ordered a grande cold brew without ice and got this. Asked if they could fill it up and they said they weren't allowed to fill it past a certain line. Literally the only Starbucks I've been to that was this stingy. If you have options, definitely don't go to this one.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Mar 18, 2023~We have stopped here several times over the last few years on our drive thru Alabama and this is without a doubt the the worst Starbucks you will ever encounter.  There are plenty of people working there so the issue must be with the managers.   It is soooo slow.    The last visit was so bad I am boycotting Starbucks for the next few months
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Sep 28, 2018~A Starbucks location in one location, is a virtual copy of a Starbucks in another location - with very little variation between locations. This location has easy access from the interstate. When our orders came, they were correct and although service was a little slower than expected, they were only slightly outside of the usual wait. During my visit to this location, I came across an issue that I felt uncomfortable with.  I'm not sure if this is a Prattville issue or a Starbucks issue, but here goes. When signing into the `"free`" wi-fi, the Starbucks - Prattville location wanted several pieces of personal information and I felt hesitant to provide it. I could not know how my personal information would be stored, or the chance that someone else would be able to access my info. It is now standard around the world for the user to sign into wi-fi, without having to provide any personal information.  I chose not to sign-in. I will definitely visit this location again when I am in the area. I love Starbucks and I love good coffee.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Nov 20, 2021~Absolutely the slowest morning at uncoordinated place in Prattville. 9 employees working only one that seems to know what is going on.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Nov 8, 2020~This places needs some help! Very very long wait times far exceeding anything I have seen before. It is not just a  one time fluke but every single time waiting time averages 15 mins for coffee to go(not drive through). Trashy entrance with trash can over flowing every single time! I wish there were over options but Starbucks has the market.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Sep 27, 2020~They are absolutely rude and the trash outside was overflowing on the ground not just one but two of their trash cans were disgusting and completely unsanitary. They had customers who happened to be black in the restaurant not wearing a mask but, as soon as we walked in the door they told us to put our masks on and wear it right. They never said a word to the other customers. They were disgusting in their approach and we absolutely will not be back. As a matter of fact this completely sealed the deal of us never buying Starbucks again! The snarky kids they hire treat us like garbage. It's disgusting and what's wrong with our world right now.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Aug 30, 2021~Long inefficient line.  Asked for a sausage breakfast sandwich only to be told they had run out of ALL breakfast sandwiches.  Ordered pumpkin bread....they were out of that too.  My iced Chai was 80% ice!  3 sips and it was done...never again!
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Jun 18, 2019~Terribly slow, and the cashier at the drive through was rude and snippy. The drinks felt rushed and let's be honest that's what Starbucks is about. I wouldn't put so much stock into the employees as I would the products, you don't have to like your job but represent the company not yourself.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Nov 14, 2021~This is the second time in the last month that I have waited over 40 minutes for an order. No one seems pressed to get orders filled. I wouldn't waste time going to this location! Especially if you are trying to get on the road to travel, or have any sort of plans in general. Also, doing a mobile order does not help!!
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Aug 7, 2022~Unbearably slow service. I noticed the line wrapped around the building for the drive thru (with no room around in case you change your mind fyi) so I went inside. There were four people in front of me and it took 15 minutes to even get to me. I ordered one grande vanilla bean frap. It took another 15 minutes to come out to me. The staff was cranking out the mobile orders but didn't seem to put any priority on people waiting in the store. A bit ridiculous to wait a half hour in store for one drink. Clearly this is an indication that this city needs another Starbucks location or the staff is under trained and unmotivated to manage a Sunday morning in this city. This is not the first time I've had very slow service here either. I went drive thru last time and again it was between 15-25 minutes for one drink. It just defeats the purpose of a store like Starbucks.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Jul 12, 2021~I ordered a latte @ 135 degrees....not only was it on the ticket, the cashier verbally announced `"Latte for Debbie is 135 degrees`"  I took a sip and immediately burnt my tongue! It was certainly not at the lower 135 degree temp. No excuse.....they were not at all busy!!
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Jun 18, 2021~It's a Starbucks! Coffee was good, the wait was fair and the staff was friendly and fully masked. It was also clean and well maintained.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Jan 29, 2018~I come to this Starbucks quite often because it is easy access from the interstate. My order is always right and I never have a problem with the service. The wait time varies on the time of day. I mainly go thru the drive thru. I noticed if go very early in the morning, I get my order within a minute. Other times it can be almost 10 minutes.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Dec 26, 2015~This Starbucks is pretty much like all of the other ones I have been to. It was super busy when we arrived .We opted to go in although they do have a drive thru. Service was fine. Our coffee was made right and it was super hot.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Nov 22, 2018~I go here all the time. They won't let you know if they don't have ingredients until after they finish the order.  It's extremely bad customer service. No comp drinks or offers to make up for it if they don't have the drink or are unable to fill the order properly, available and it was a mobile order.  I've waited on an order only to be told there was no coconut milk. Then I had to wait on a clearly unwanted replacement.  No use to try to explain that they need to put in the system the supplies are no longer available or products. They apologize and that's the best you will get. Lol  There have been many good experiences over several years though.  There should be 10 stars as a review to be fair.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Dec 27, 2021~Would give it zero starts. They could care less about service. They prefer socializing and gooding off over working. Another customer asked how much longer her drink would take, the guy said it is about a 20-25 minute wait for drinks. Last time I checked Starbucks was not a restaurant nor should it ever talk that long with 6 people working. It is your job to make drinks and food quickly not to laugh and goof off with customers. The drive through does not need 2-3 people making drinks and 1 person making online and in person drinks. Worst service I have ever had and witnessed. Go else where if you actually want something made in a reasonable time. Shameful that they are not being held to the standards of other Starbucks. I was there a 1 in the afternoon and left after 1:30.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Oct 19, 2017~Was a hot mess. In their defense packed with tourists grabbing orders or taking wrong orders creating mayhem. The baristas did a good job trying to restore some flow to process but I'd skip this one if you see drive-thru line wrapping around bldg. Ordered online and only had iced coffee so got thru within 5 mins and I was in minority of those waiting.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Sep 5, 2021~Awful drinks and customer service. Do not go here a waste of time and money. Had to wait beyond the estimated time for a mobile order, which okay I get it sometimes a place gets busy. But the Lattes were disgusting and not made right. I couldn't even drink it. What a waste. Called to get a refund but was told no by two extremely rude employees  who wouldn't provide their names.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Apr 19, 2019~Understaffed but the staff that is there works hard and hustles. Should be a violation to understaff a Starbucks.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Jun 21, 2017~So this is a decent Starbucks.  They have basically a similar selection of items compared to other Starbucks.  This one also has a drive through although the signage from the outside is hard to spot.  I decided to go inside figuring that would be a bit quicker.  This place obviously is pretty busy in the morning as its right of Rt. 82 just before the interstate.  Service was quick and the staff was nice.  I generally come in and get coffee anyways versus ordering complicated drinks especially so early in the morning.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Jul 23, 2018~Uh, I think I will continue making my own coffee at home. I had two negative experiences at Starbucks and that was enough for me. Not only were my frappe latte's mediocre but overpriced as well. The staff and the work station were chaotic bumping into one another and even knocked over a cup or two in the chaos. To top it off during my second and final visit, when I received my frappe latte the barista had written 'BARBIE' where my name should have been written. Instead of making a fuss, I left my order on the counter and never went back.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Mar 22, 2014~Nice Starbucks.  Friendly staff, clean floors, spacious.  Fair amount of plugs for connected work/leisure.Not overrun with Swag, which is nice.Nice patio seating.Not earth-shatteringly cool.  Just nice.Did I say it's `"nice`"?Starbucks: When you think you need a cup of Pavlovian comfort at a gourmet price.Oh Snap!  Noticed the standard legacy pendulum lamps aren't over the pickup area.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Oct 8, 2021~Customer service is out the window! I've never been spoken to so rudely! I thought I would give them another chance and I was still disappointed by there customer service. The manager of all people was the one to snap at me. I was just trying to order my drink and he was acting like I should know everything about Starbucks like I work there or something. So disappointed. Starbucks back in Florida are way better. They knew how to not snap at there customers!!!!!
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Apr 1, 2021~The employees were very rude. Do they even care about customer service. This is not what I expect from a Starbucks. I think I'm going to delete the app because of this.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Nov 21, 2018~I wish I could give zero starsWaited 30 min They lost my order No apologies No comped drinks It may be time to boycott Starbucks The service gets worse and worse every day
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Sep 14, 2019~First time visiting this Starbucks. I was just passing thru. I did mobile order and went through the drive up. The guy working was so nice and even called me ma'am. Me= shook. My drink was amazing. Blended perfectly. I'm pretty picky when it comes to my $7 drink and they exceeded my expectations! I wish every Starbucks was this good at making fraps!
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Jul 23, 2016~This is by far one of the most poorly managed Starbucks I've ever been to in the entire country. Perhaps it's because I'm from Seattle and I take my coffee seriously but every time I try and come to this Starbucks, the drive-thru line is absolutely insane and it can take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to get a single iced coffee if you go inside. The employees seem to lack efficiency. Just last weekend my husband and I attempted to get a coffee before we traveled to Birmingham but the line inside and out was so long and so slow-moving that we just decided to drive to Birmingham and get our Starbucks there. Another example, I'm sitting in the drive-thru line right now. It's a Saturday afternoon around 4:00pm, I've been sitting in the drive-thru line for over 20 minutes just to get a single drink! I never have these problems at any other Starbucks, except this one in Prattville!
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Dec 29, 2019~If you're in a hurry DONT GO HERE. Drive through takes twenty plus minutes.....and I'm still waiting! I can't even back out because the roads so narrow. I worked food service before so I understand how long quality food can take to make but this is beyond ridiculous for just a couple of lattes
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Dec 21, 2019~Was one of the worst Starbucks I've been too! Ordered to drinks an they were completely messed up . They `" remade them twice an still gave us the wrong drinks . The manger was very rude when I called complain about it . I wouldn't recommend going there . Also the bathroom is very dirty an trash spilling out of trash can inside
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Apr 5, 2021~I already felt indifferent about going to this location due to lack of consistency, but after this morning I will not be back. The person working the window was very rude and my drinks were made incorrectly. Its not worth it
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Oct 8, 2016~25 mins to order, another half hour to get a freaking cup of coffee...  ludicrous.  16 cups at the bar with zero takers, girls backed up, I think people are leaving and saying screw it.. I was really close.  the manager here needs to get with it because they are loosing business.   this will be the last cup I ever get here.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Mar 17, 2018~Please don't go through the drive through if you're in a hurry. This is consistently an extremely slow line.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Dec 30, 2016~Used the Starbucks app to place our order to stay in the growing line. I guess they do the app orders last as many have come and gone and we are still waiting for our drinks! Several people walked in during our wait and got served and left before us...Poor treatment, we ended up waiting 20 mins for our drinks.
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Dec 25, 2018~All right, I get it that at times they may mess your order up or they don't get it to you quick as you would like.  This is the busiest Starbucks in Alabama. All of the slushbirds from up north pass through here to go to the beach. Busy. There are not many choices on 65 between here and the beach.  Of course, this makes for pandemonium at times. In spite of that, you get your coffee or latte or frap.  These guys pull it off.  Maybe not as smooth as you would like, but they work it well.  This is what I love about living in a relatively free country.  You can protest your feelings and you can choose not to visit a business. I will visit the store and often.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Nov 10, 2015~I've been to Starbucks in just about every state in the US and several in Germany and the Middle East. Sometimes they can be slow, but I haven't seen them any slower than any other Starbucks. Great staff that really try hard; in spite of some of the jerks that come in (like some of the negative reviews here).  Yes they tend to be drive-through centric, but so are all i've been to. It would help, if you knew what the hell you wanted before you got to the register. BTW, they should not take multiple orders from anyone unless it is called in.  That slows everyone down. Still a very good Starbucks in spite of the negative nellies.
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Aug 15, 2015~The go-to coffee place in Prattville.  They're fast, friendly, and convenient to the freeway.  It's hard to drive by it and not want to stop in for something tasty.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Dec 13, 2017~Made a pit stop on a trip home and ordered a venti of the Christmas blend. I went to go put sugar in it and they were out of sugar. Asked the barista for more and she informed me they only had Splenda. WHY would you wait until after I paid to tell me you don't have sugar, a key ingredient in most coffees. They didn't seem to even care. Also, don't use the restroom there because the lock is broken on the door.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Feb 21, 2016~Not very efficient at filling orders. Even though there were 6 employees working when I visited, it still took about 8-9 minutes before my drink was made. The drink was good. It seems to be a training issue. 2 of the employees were joking/giggling and not totally concentrated on filling orders. I'm all for fun at work but let's keep our eye on the business at hand. Cups were all over the place, it seemed as if the employees were not familiar with the process.  I probably just came thru at a bad time the last 3 times I've been here. I'm sure they have faster turnaround times  Overall, not a bad place to visit, as long as your not in a rush. Plenty of seating, outlets and outdoor tables also. Wifi was spotty all three times I visited.
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Jul 14, 2018~Horribly slow service. Yes the drink was good, yes, the store was busy, but I place a mobile order 10 minutes out (only one drink). It even asked me if I wanted to order yet because the drink would only take 4-7 minutes.  25 minutes after I arrived in the store I received my drink.   Most people who were not there had been waiting 20-30 minutes.    Again, busy, yes, but not THAT busy.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Aug 23, 2019~This location has wonderful people working but, the PARKING- YUCK! Best to go thru the Drive-thru. You will be happier.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~May 31, 2020~Stay away! This starbucks funnels you around the back of a very long building and once you are in the 25minute line, there is no escape. After reading other poor reviews, i thought i'll stick with pikes...how can you screw coffee up? Cold and burned. My daughter cannot drink milk and selected an almond latte. She received a regular milk latte. If you like Starbucks, move to the next one. If you like coffee, find a different source. Starbucks should be ashamed of themselves for allowing a franchise like this to stay in business.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Jan 26, 2020~Took way too long to get my order. Ended up getting the wrong order and having to wait even more. Overall, not my favorite Starbucks. Barristas do not speak the order loud enough for anybody to hear.
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Jul 19, 2017~Just had the most pleasant interaction with Hugh in the drive thru. Will be stopping by this Starbucks for a pick me up on the way back from the beach as well!
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Aug 27, 2016~In a nutshell, I stopped going to this Starbucks (coffee addict!) because of the slow and horrible service. I gave them 3 opportunities...first time, I thought it was just a simple mistake, ordered two items and they just forgot to give me the 2nd one, and the barista knew I was waiting for something (place wasn't packed), second and third time basically the same. The beverages were poorly prepared and the service is poorly executed, both in store and drive thru...
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Nov 22, 2018~Every time I've placed a mobile order for this location it either takes me 15+ minutes to get it or they loose my order. I don't understand why this location has such a hard time getting drinks out in a reasonable amount of time
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Jul 28, 2017~Stopped here for a caffeine pit stop and got the Venti, White Chocolate Mocha with Almond Milk.  Very tasty!  I'm lactose intolerant, so this was nice and easy on my stomach.  The cashier was super nice and I double checked my order to make sure they put Almond milk and not regular.  The guy ran over to Barista and came back to give me the thumbs up!  Definitely will be returning .  Also, prices great!  Venti was under six dollars.  Less than what I'm use to!  Yay!
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Jun 2, 2016~Quality and speed have both improved. I would say this location is now squarely average.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Oct 16, 2015~Slow. Slow. Slow. Can't even tell you how many people just give up on getting a cup of coffee every morning because of how slow this place runs. Off hand I'd estimate 10+ minutes average in line at drive through.And the only reason to go to Starbucks - quality control, is not there either.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~May 9, 2017~I'm not sure why I am even bothering with this review....Star Bucks is too big of a chain and they make LOTS of money off of people like me even when I'm complaining, so why would they make any adjustments to the way they do business when bad customer service and `"okay`" tasting coffee makes them millions. Nonetheless I rated this place as 2-star because it doesn't matter what time of the day or what day of the week it is, you will still wait....and wait...and wait for your coffee. So if you have a lot of free time, then this is the place for you. Their outdoor seating is horribly placed in the parking lot right by the drive through. So if you like the smell of car exhaust, and oil stained asphalt then take a seat. But I guess if they didn't have an outdoor seating option someone would complain about that...so be grateful for what you have right?  The seating on the inside is better than some, but WAY to over crowded with little round tables. There's a nice seating area directly to your left when you walk in (couches, chairs tables) and then directly to your right is about 9-12 two seater round tables crammed next to each other. Not sure they thought that through. The best seat in the house is at the long high table in the middle of the store. That is if you don't mind bumping shoulders with the man bun backpack wearing dude who is there ALL THE TIME. Would recommend getting your coffee to go. Enjoy!
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Nov 7, 2016~This Starbucks seems to be like every other I have been to which is quite a few. On occasion, the drive thru line is outrageous but it's no worse than a Chick Fil A during its busiest hours. I work in Prattville so I visit frequently and have never had a problem concerning service. Everyone is very kind and seem to try and do their best. I am shocked that the other reviews are so horrible...
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Feb 28, 2018~It wasn't that busy but it took awhile to get my drink.  I wanted to redeem my rewards but the cashier got the information wrong.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~Dec 30, 2015~One of those cases of `"C'mon, it's a Starbucks, what is there to say?`"  But I do like the physical space with high ceilings.  The interior totally masked by the strip mall exterior (is this a new design thing for Starbucks?  If so, then great).  Sunday morning in Prattville so LOTS of churchin' folk.  But also some hipsters!  Wow.  In Prattville?!  I have added it to my I-65 Southbound rest stop list ;)
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Sep 26, 2015~This is the slowest Starbucks I've ever seen, and I've been to Starbucks in pretty much every state. On several occasions I've had to leave the drive thru after sitting more than 20 minutes and still not being able to order.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Oct 8, 2016~Had to wait a little bit to order which was understandable since they were busy. But after twenty minutes and I still didn't have my drink I said something to the cashier, told her my name, and she told them the wrong name. Five minutes after that they're still making other people's drinks that came in after me and I asked for my money back. One girl went `"I got it`" and made a grande when I had ordered and paid for a vinte with an extra shot of expresso. This is by far the worst Starbucks I have ever been to. Just save your time and go to either the Eastchase or Target locations.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Mar 7, 2018~i'm upset. i got an iced almond milk latte and it tasted like coal, which is upsetting considering i love both starbucks and iced almond milk lattes. 10/10 will not return. partially because i don't live here.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Aug 12, 2015~Even though there is a Starbucks down the street inside the Target, I prefer coming to this one because the staff is more knowledgeable of the menu, are quicker, and the best, the drive through! Friendly staff here and they always spell my name right too lol. Free Wifi here so basically everything that every other Starbucks has.
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Nov 24, 2018~Very friendly service!! And ALWAYS fully stocked with ingredients needed to serve customers!!
Prattville, AL 36066~2~Jun 4, 2015~When it's actually open and has what you order in stock, it's good. Far too often, though, they aren't open as late as their posted hours and are out of basic coffee menu items. Not sure if it's a staff, management, or franchisee issue, but this is the most unreliable Starbucks location I've been to.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Sep 10, 2015~Don't bother going inside, they only care about the damn drive-through (bunch of rude.....)
Prattville, AL 36066~5~Jan 22, 2016~I just went thru the drive thru on my break and the guy I didn't catch his name but he had a beard and tattoos and he was so nice and very helpful. I'm not in a very good mood today but he cheered me up right away. Great service and fast.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Aug 26, 2017~Worst experience I have ever had at a Starbucks. Incredibly rude service. The girl who took my order barely said a word and gave me the death stare for wanting my receipt printed. They didn't even call my name when my drink was ready. I finally looked over and just saw it sitting there. I asked if it was mine and no one even looked back at me or answered. Thank goodness it was mine because I just had to pick it up and hope it had my name on it.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Jan 1, 2016~Worst service ever!  Took 10 minutes for a vanilla latte (not counting the 10 wait in line).  Silly woman behind the espresso machine was doing nothing but laughing, joking, and distracting her coworkers.  10 drinks were waiting to be made, but only one machine was in operation.  Avoid this Starbucks if you are looking for a quick pick me up off the interstate.
Prattville, AL 36066~1~Sep 19, 2016~Terrible service...rude! Dedicate 90% of their effort to the drive through, at the expense of those ordering inside.  I ordered a drink...20 minutes later inquired about the whereabouts of said drink and was told they didn't know where it was but would check. Went back 5 minutes later, same unprofessional blonde male employee said, `"nope, couldn't find it.`" Never made eye contact with me and just went about his business.  I kept my cool and another employee made my drink.  Sucks that they are the only one in town. Avoid it if possible.
Prattville, AL 36066~3~May 5, 2014~Worlds slowest moving drive thru!! The last 3 times I've come to the drive thru I have had to wait a MINIMUM of 10 minutes. There were only 2 or 3 cars in front of me each time! This is ridiculous.
Prattville, AL 36066~4~Sep 5, 2015~This Starbucks is okay. Seems like they are always busy with the normal coffee house crowd so their isn't anywhere to sit and enjoy your coffee. I've had a few encounters with rude baristas. One barista in particular  has a lot of facial hair... Which kinda freaks me out. No hair net or anything.
Target~1~Feb 17, 2024~I mobile ordered my drink at 10:38AM. I was closer than 15 minutes away so I expected to wait a few minutes for my order what I didn't expect is to wait for over 30 minutes for my drink. The Starbucks wasn't even busy. When I asked the barista if she has seen a drink order for Holly (almost 30 minutes later; I thought someone might have grabbed my drink on accident). I told her how long I've been waiting she asked to see my order on my phone; and, she was just overall rude. Then she looked for it and someone else was making my order. I understand that this location has a drive through but they shouldn't be 30 minutes behind on mobile orders when the Starbucks wasn't even busy. I'm a frequent customer of Starbucks and my mobile order is never ready within 15 minutes like it is supposed to be at this location (I'm a local of this town that this Starbucks is in). This is the only Starbucks location I've ever been to that takes this long to make one drink.
Target~1~Dec 26, 2021~The worst  run  starbucks ever, after 40 minutes  waiting  i finally  asked for money  back and others followed and asked for their money-back. Its not like  they were busy , ten minutes or more calling  a customers name to get drink .
Target~4~Nov 26, 2017~So, full disclosure, I don't drink coffee, ever! That being said this is probably the third Starbucks I've ever been in. This is a small location that is located in the local Target so not quite the same experience as I've seen/had at an actual Starbucks location. However, it compares to all the other ones that are inside other Target locations. So, since I don't drink coffee, I tried the Caramel Apple Spice. Simply put this is amazing...made with:Steamed, freshly pressed apple juice and cinnamon syrup. Topped with sweetened whipped cream and caramel drizzle.So I'm kind of torn because I have never craved Starbucks, until now. This is actually a drink I would go out of my way to stop and grab on a cool morning looking for something to warm up. Staff here was friendly and had a few customers since it was Black Friday morning. They were as quick as possible to get people in and out. Should add that they had all of the normal coffee and cold drink options you would expect to find at Starbucks to go along with the pastries they typically offer.Give them a try, especially if you are already inside Target.
Target~1~Jun 25, 2016~I have to agree with the rest of the reviews, this place is pretty bad.  I came to target to go shopping and decided to get a drink from Starbucks.  I always get a white chocolate mocha frap, but I noticed it wasn't on the menu under the frap flavors.  I ordered it anyway since they had `"white chocolate mocha`" as a flavor for something else on the menu.  I got my drink and started walking around target.  I took several sips and had to take it back, it was so gross and melted quickly.  I don't know what they put in it but it tasted like caramel.  Not just caramel, but old, nasty caramel.   Yuck.
Target~5~Dec 27, 2021~Very good coffee! Only one worker and many people there yet I still got my coffee within 10 minutes!
Target~5~Dec 29, 2019~Great coffee fast. Despite having the same amount of people ahead of me this location always serves faster even with one employee. They always have a better stock as well and are very friendly. My go to place for coffee in town from here on out!
Target~1~Mar 13, 2020~We waited for about a minute at the front counter and then the lady came from the side and said I am helping a customer over here, I'm sorry. Then she disappeared into the back again. We waited about 5 minutes. We were like `"hello?! Anyone there??`" And there was no answer. So we waited a couple more seconds then left. When we left we saw she was sitting at a table with a few other girls talking. We were there at 12:00 pm on 03/13/2020
Target~2~Jul 19, 2020~There was 1 customer in front of me who waited about 10 minutes AFTER I got there so there is no telling how long she was waiting before I got there. The 2 baristas were just walking to the back and back up front over and over just gossiping about who knows what. They never once looked my way to acknowledge me or apologize for the wait. Finally, after about 20 minutes total of waiting, one girl took my order and it literally took her only about 1 minute to make my drink that I waited so long to even order. I am 9 months pregnant which is not hard to tell and literally can barely stand up at this point and not one time was I told sorry for having to wait there for so long. Not to mention I had frozen foods from grocery shopping at target. I highly recommend going to the starbucks less than a mile up the road, NOT in target!
Target~1~Feb 4, 2014~HORRIBLE! As a frequent starbucks customer, I know my espresso. I've been to locations all across the United States and this is THE WORST. Ever. Just plain bad. more expensive than any other starbucks.. I ordered a venti iced Carmel macchiato but I got a weak Carmel flavored milk instead... wtf? Oh, and I couldn't get a trenta either.. since when is that only for tea? My husband ordered a Carmel frap and I wish I could tell you what the girl did wrong but it tasted so bad I spit it out. I'm telling you this girl needs to be trained on what a barista DOES or she needs to be FIRED. Oh and I don't even want to get started on my customer service experience... I almost feel as if she made our drinks this bad on purpose... how do you screw up this bad? Just stay away from this place... I paid 5 bucks for a cup of milk... and all I wanted was a little espresso..
Target~5~Oct 24, 2017~They were very polite and were  helpful and shit.I want to buy all kinds of cool shit in there
Target~1~Nov 24, 2018~Terrible attitudes of the employees and y'all need to have a sign of items that are unavailable instead of having someone standing in line for 30+minutes and then find out as you start to place your order.. Yesterday was my FINAL time going to this Starbucks!!
Target~5~Aug 2, 2011~This is my `"home`" Starbucks. It's the only Starbucks in the Millbrook/Prattville areas and resides inside the Target Store. I love EVERY barista there. The baristas know my name, drinks &amp; schedule. It can get super busy, so be prepared to wait at times and give the baristas a break for goodness sake! The service is great &amp; they meet the quality you would expect from Starbucks.
Target~1~Nov 16, 2012~Okay- so as the poster said above, it gets busy, sometimes a 20 minute wait-- and again it's not the baristas fault, I have witnessed people being horribly rude to some of the girls behind the counter-- it's not there fault! ugh But I also witnessed a customer speaking with management on a Saturday morning when the line was at least 10 people deep with only one staff member behind the counter and the manager didn't have a good response :( hire more staff!! Thanks from a loyal Starbucks lover!
Target~1~Mar 2, 2013~This `"Starbucks`" is a joke. Typically one barista working which causes the line to back up. Pastry case is sometimes empty. They ran out of two sizes of hot coffee lids on a Saturday, and they weren't restocked until Monday afternoon. Management does not seem to care. The baristas are for the most part friendly, but the bottom line is that this is a poorly managed location, and Prattville desperately needs a freestanding location with a drive-thru.
Target~1~Jan 25, 2014~The people are very nice and apologetic but unless I go at 6AM the line is long, they are usually out if most food and this time they completely messed up my order.  Ordered 2 Grande White Chocolate Mochas and got 1 Grande and 1 tall black horrible coffees.  Also ordered 2 bagels with cream cheese and got them plain even after paying extra a.  Took so long and the line was massive so I just left and I won't be back.  Java House is much better and they even remember me and my orders when I come in.  Hire more people and train them, that's what you do in business or you lose awesome people.  Sad day when we were all excited to finally get a Starbucks!  The one in Target is better tho...
Target~1~May 25, 2016~This is the worst starbucks location I've ever visited, the baristas aren't really baristas. They are always out of stock of something.  The drinks never taste right and the staff is rude.  I'll go to the real Starbucks down the road and bring it into target with me.  At least they get it right aren't rude.
Target~1~Dec 10, 2014~After sending back my drink three times I left with the wrong drink rather than wait in line again and try to get it fixed.  Barista had no idea what she was doing.
Target~4~Mar 10, 2015~Stopped in for a couple of Latte's, a blueberry muffin and a veggie sandwich.  The muffin was tasty, my husband didn't care for the veggie sandwich, but the Latte's hit the spot.
Target~2~Sep 5, 2015~Not my favorite Starbucks. Usually tastes different than a `"real`" Starbucks. Out of stock a lot. Most baristas are cashiers. Do they get training!?
Target~1~Nov 21, 2012~I just ordered a tall cappuccino and, once again, Starbucks failed to deliver.  I have been to hundreds of Starbucks across the U.S. and it always amazes me how inconsistent the cappuccinos are.  A cappuccino should be made with equal amounts of milk and espresso.  At this particular location the barista poured the espresso into the cup and then filled the rest of the cup with milk - very little froth.  Imagine what happens to the flavor of the espresso once you dilute it with nearly 2 cups of milk.  It tastes like warm milk with a subtle coffee flavor (if you close your eyes and concentrate).  What the barista unintentionally made was a latte.  Why does the King of Coffeehouses not train  the baristas in making these?  I'm not just picking on this one location, it happens as often as not.  Please, Starbucks, I really WANT to continue this relationship.  You have long served as my beacon of light on early work mornings and late night travels.    Please develop a training program that will guarantee consistence so I am not left with my disappointment as I face the remaining of my long, tiresome, late Thanksgiving trip.
Fred Meyer~1~Aug 10, 2021~This is one of two Starbucks locations in town. This one is located inside Fred Meyer, and the other is located inside Safeway. Takes a few minutes to get you drinks here because the same barista making the drinks is also the one taking and cashing out orders.My experience here would've been a decent one if it wasn't for their faulty cups. I always hold my cups the same way as I'm getting into the car but for some reason this particular cup and/or lid was faulty. The lid popped off as the cup was hovering over my lap and spilled hot coffee all over my shorts, seat and vehicle. Luckily I got out of the car immediately and didn't get burned. It was inconvenient having to go back in to get a big stack of napkins to attempt to dry off my clothes and car enough so that it wouldn't be dripping wet.
Fred Meyer~5~Jul 20, 2023~I have been here everyday for about 2 weeks, and it is the best Starbucks I have been too! Lee is a absolutely amazing barista, and my experience is even better when he is working!!
Fred Meyer~4~Feb 1, 2019~I feel that this one has more of a bakery selection than the Safeway location (hence why I came here when the pumpkin scones came out). Even with a complicated order, they were still able to get it right. Way to go Starbucks. (One other thing I noticed was even the price difference between this and the Safeway location - amazing!)
Fred Meyer~1~Jun 25, 2017~This Starbucks is located inside Fred Meyer. Service is hit it miss. Yesterday I got a coffee drink and requested, and paid for, soy milk. Caleb took my order and made the drink. I noticed when I came around the side of the counter that he was steaming milk from a pitcher marked dairy. I asked him if he was using soy and he assured me he was. I got my drink and left. To make a long story short, it wasn't soy and I ended up throwing it out as I am allergic (not lactose intolerant) to milk. I didn't have time to run back to Starbucks. I'm really disappointed and this was the last thing I needed on an already lousy day. I won't go back. Ever. Wish I could give zero stars.
Fred Meyer~3~Jun 11, 2015~This Starbucks location is inside Fred Meyers, small, at the front, near the fresh produce section.  Tipping is not permitted, which I support.  A 16 oz cup of coffee will cost around USD 2.2
Safeway~5~Mar 20, 2023~There drinks Are amazingly delicious. There service is great they don't make you wait to long. I flat out love that place.
Safeway~3~Feb 11, 2018~Love that there is at least a Starbucks in Juneau (among less familiar places), however the prices do reject that this is indeed a Starbucks in Juneau. One time, I had ordered a cranberry bliss bar and it looked big and delicious from the display window. The barista cut it in half and put a square piece no bigger than a mouse-sized piece of cheese. Could be saved $3 by getting a donut from the grocery store bakery instead.Also, every year I get the molten chocolate frappucino the week before Valentine's Day, and was told that they no longer offer it not could make a decent substitute for it this year. Thank you
Safeway~5~Nov 13, 2017~Carry out weekly and is consistently amazing. Their pizza is great and if you haven't tried the chicken you're missing the best this side of the river! Service has always been a '5'. Keep it up guys and gals!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Aug 1, 2024~very weird starbucks. it's very modern &amp; clean but the wifi doesn't work, there aren't any outlets (they have 2 fake outlets), &amp; i couldnt actually tell i was walking into the right place at first because there isn't anything saying where the business's ' door is.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Dec 9, 2024~The location was good and inside has a pleasant interior setting. The vibe was pretty cool. They have nice customer service. The coffee was really delicious. Ordered a latte yesterday but it was not hot. The staff was friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Nov 15, 2023~Holiday cup season has begun!  Convienent location just off I 17. Lines move fast and orders are accurate. Drive through window is also pretty quick if that is your approach.  I only ever get coffee drinks, so I can't comment on the food preparedness.It's Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Aug 17, 2024~Really never super busy and it's easy access to the I 17. Definitely interesting near the highway though with a pretty transient population close by. Not sure what they could do about it but it is a little unnerving at times.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Jul 17, 2023~Convienent location just a block to I 17. Lines usually move pretty quick and orders are usually accurate. Drive through window is also pretty quick but that depends on the day. Not one of  our favorite locations mostly because we've had a couple of cold breakfast sandwiches and they have been out of things we wanted to order.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jul 31, 2024~It's always this store that i go to that ALWAYS gets the drinks I order made WRONG or disgusting! Like it's insane and exhausting along w a waste of gas having to go out of my way to another store to have it fixed.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Aug 19, 2022~I love this Starbucks. I was scared when was open so close to my house that I was going to go a lot but hasn't been too bad  I did pick up a habit of going on lunch break from work though. This staff is super friendly and efficient. It's a grab and go only Starbucks but judging by the area of bell road that makes sense. I don't like sweet so I've been getting a latte with oat milk and it hits the spot every time! I've gone to many Starbucks over the years and I love this location. Never had any issues. Foods always good, service is pretty fast and most importantly the drinks a superb.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jan 5, 2019~It's a hit or miss with Starbucks lately, but this one was great. No complaints. Quick and efficient. As usual, Starbucks is overpriced for what ya get. The staff was friendly and got my drinks made quickly. I got iced coffee as usual, but it was made properly unlike most locations. Thanks!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Nov 10, 2023~I think if I'm supporting an establishment to the tune of more than $6 for a cup of coffee, they should have at least one of their 2 restrooms available to the public! I do not feel it's fair to support an establishment that does not provide basic services!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Nov 27, 2023~Location very busy, employees are nice but manager was nasty to guests and did not seem helpful
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Apr 18, 2023~One of the worst Starbucks in the world.  There's no indoor seating and no condiments out where you can use them, and when I asked about condiments, I got a surly response. It's like it's June of 2020 in there. Tables and chairs are all piled along the wall, so there's no where to sit while you wait. The drive through might be just fine, though there was an awful long line. Just don't think you're going to `"go to Starbucks`" at this place.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Mar 16, 2023~The music's blasting so loudly that even if they had seating you wouldn't want to. Ridiculously run by the Starbucks `"kids`". The positive was the drink was made properly, but as usual you must ask for everything else. Stir sticks, cream, etc...Also the prices here are higher by at least .40 ct. (near I-17).
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Aug 11, 2023~I can't recommend this Starbucks.  It's 100 degrees outside and I pay $7 for an iced coffee and their seating area is closed.  I ask why and they say `"the area`" and I ask for clarification and they say `"our location`".  Which seems like a fairly average location.  It shares a building with a Chipotle, is next door to a Waffle House, a barbecue restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, 3 hotels, a barber shop, a donut shop, and a credit union.  Across the street are car dealerships and it's at a large freeway off-ramp.  So OK, I can't sit walk over from my hotel and enjoy my coffee - like I can in nearly every other Starbucks in existence.  If this place is so bad - how does Chipotle in the same building work?  But if you're not going to let people use your space - close it down.  I would have gone to the donut shop next door and got coffee if I had known you were going to be anti-customer at this Starbucks location.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Sep 20, 2019~My drink tasted different then other places. Also they forgot my caramel drizzle, maybe that's why. Maybe they were busy and forgot about it but still. He asked if we need a drink carrier &amp; I said no but he still gave us one. There's a drive thru at this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~May 12, 2022~Ridiculous rude person on the order today. We go here several times a day. I let the person know we had a mobile order. She didn't here the name so I said it again, she didn't hear it and asked a 3rd time so I raised my voice again thinking it must be the other engines and she told me I didn't need to yell it. I didn't even know what to say to that I was so taken Off guard and she went on being snarky to me when I'll we wanted was to just pick up our order like on every other time we were there. We literally won't be back. Her rude mocking was just way unprofessional.There was a nice person handing out drinks that was trying to say sorry for her and that was kind. My opinion is if you are going to jump at people maybe the service industry isn't for you.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Sep 30, 2023~No indoor services past 1:00PM. If you walk here from a car dealership just be aware it's drive thru only.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Apr 19, 2019~Newer Starbucks right off the I-17 and bell! Modern interiors and next to a Chipotle if your hungry too!I did a drive thru on this visit- Johnathan was amazing! He was so refreshing, had a smile on his face and asked what I was up to this weekend? When has anyone ever asked what I was up to (unless I was at Dutch Bros.)- he was a friendly picker upper for my day and I appreciated the light of joy he brought in the quick 5 mins it took to get my drink! Green Tea Frappe was perfect for today- it's hot!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Nov 10, 2020~Huge cafe and well made near to I-17. The staff was nice too. Drinks are obviously like all Starbucks. I rarely give 5-star to this chain since I prefer local coffee chains more but for the size and the courtesy of the staff, I would give it easily to this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 8, 2023~I absolutely cannot stand this place. First time I went for a Medicine Ball as I do when it's cold out and it was as if they just gave me hot water, no flavor and no tea bags were even in the cup. I was disappointed and said to myself maybe it was an off day. Today (2/8/23) I went in for a vanilla cream cold brew w/ brown sugar syrup as it is one of my go to drinks, today I can now say for certain it was not an off day. I had ordered the exact drink at the Target Starbucks and it was perfect and delicious. The one I ordered today was a taste of disappointment and regret, one sip and straight into the garbage it went. I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND GOING TO ANY STARBUCKS OTHER THAN THIS ONE.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jan 28, 2023~So don't go on the weekend they used to have order and pickup door. Well now it's closed the whole lobby is as a matter of fact. Everyone must go thru the drive thru. I got my drinks after 12 min of waiting in the drive thru plus the online order wait time. So very watered down drinks. You should turn off you online order option
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Mar 3, 2023~Do not buy through app here. You will need to sit in line as they don't open their lobby as advertise. I had ordered 10/15 minutes ahead through the app and when I got there, the doors were locked and I had to wait another 20 minutes in line. This was quite upsetting since that's the whole point of mobile orders. The coffee was great but this was my first and last visit to this spot. Since I do work about 5 minutes from this location, many of my colleagues let me know they also have experienced this issue many times.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Apr 1, 2023~Emma at the window was very rude and the coffee was horrible! Will never go back to this Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jan 24, 2022~January 1st (2450 W Bell Road Phoenix 85023) I gave the Barista $40 cash to add to my card. Found out it wasn't added and I've been trying for weeks to get this taken care of.I've spoken to corporate and they are a joke.I guess it's ok for someone to pocket my $40
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Aug 25, 2021~Order a Venti white chocolate mocha with 7 pumps of white chocolate and sweet cream foam. and got a regular iced coffee. Hell yeah yea that best
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jul 29, 2023~So, I bashed this place before when they changed people and it was HORRIBLE so feel like I should do a follow up. They struggled finding good people for a while. NOW they have good employees again. They are friendly, they actually listen to your order and my drink is always good. They have this guy Tyler at the window that is just as friendly as Anthony was and just as great at making sure your order is perfect with a great team to back him up.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Dec 5, 2021~I can't with this Starbucks location anymore. Where is Anthony? After this guy left, something on my order is always wrong and sometimes, they don't even fix it properly. I asked for a Soy Chai Latte with a shot of espresso. I got a triple shot latte so I went back, asked again. They were nice and apologized and said they will fix it...damn it if they didn't give me ANOTHER triple shot latte. The girl said, `"no, it's right, it just don't have a label on it`" but it tastes EXACTLY like the first one that does have a label. This is the 4th time it's happened to me.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Aug 15, 2022~Man what can I say about Starbucks I've been addicted for four years now the only drink that I get from there is the caramel ribbon crunch with extra caramel drizzle on the bottom extra whip cream on the bottom extra crunch pieces on the bottom in a Venti cup the drink itself is just so amazing a grin like a kid in a candy store when they sot it on the counter and call my name out I don't know what I would do if I couldn't have my daily fix thank you Starbucks for this amazing combination of flavor
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jun 27, 2023~The manager Erica is so rude. Highly recommend to go to another Starbucks. They did offer me partial reimbursement and a free drink for the experience but won't be going back to that location.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Dec 2, 2021~This store made my Carmel ribbon crunch perfectly the last Time I came in, I was actually supsrised due to the inconsistency at other locations! Who ever was making drinks on Sunday at 8:39 understood the assignment!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Mar 22, 2019~Great ServiceThis Starbucks is not my usual stop however, it just might be one of my all time favorites. I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks iced white chocolate mocha, I can't think of anything, we'll maybe if you top your coffee off with a vanilla scone.The service at this Starbucks might not be the fastest but it's still phenomenal and the staff are always very friendly. This location is clean, inviting, and feels comfortable and they have seating outside at the patio. I wish they offered more seating inside, as this Starbucks is very busy.My coffee was made exactly the way I order and tasted great. In addition, to the great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack. I really enjoy grabbing a cake pop or two to go.Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jun 25, 2022~Always gets orders wrong and the store has different hrs of operations everyday. Lights will be on and store is closed way before time states on sign. Plus they make you wait in the drive through line when you made a mobile pick up. So by the time I got my food it was cold.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jun 16, 2022~Mobile ordered and it was ready when I arrived 10 minutes later. I didn't like my drink so I came back a few hours later and the shift supervisor gladly remade it and even didn't charge me for a cake pop when I went to order one for my son. She was very nice! Wish I would've gotten her name but it was at 12:30 pm 6/16/22 :) thank you for being so kind!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jan 21, 2023~Why would they take a mobile order when the lobby isn't open?? Have to wait in the drive thru line which defeats the purpose. Would've gone to a different location.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 9, 2023~Do not order ahead here!! Their lobby is NEVER open. They might as well close the location down completely cause they even close early
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 17, 2023~this Starbucks is the worst in all of Arizona. the doors are always locked ! forget about using the bathrooms , never available, the staff are pompous especially the men in this store.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Feb 10, 2020~Yeah thanks Starbucks..I'm not sure I ordered my coffee with some coffee grounds at the bottom of my coffee to give it some texture....better luck next time..
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Oct 3, 2019~Shame on Starbucks I went thru drive thru and got a grande that was obviously not filled up I won't go here again this is the second time they've done this and didn't even add in whipped topping
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Sep 4, 2019~Weary. This is your average Starbucks. It's connected to a chipotle. I'm not a Starbucks girl but I was happy that no one tried to argue with me when I said `"small`". I tried a chicken salad wrap. It was ok. I was starving. But not really worth $9 and I wish I would have remembered the chipotle was next door. When I went to the restroom, it had a lock pad code on the door. Staff needed to let me in which made me a little weary of the area I was in.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Aug 17, 2019~Soraya (apologize if I misspelt it) Took my order and she was incredibly patient with me!! Really appreciate how nice she was and made sure my drink had cinnamon powder on top of it love coming to this location because of the staff, thank you guys!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 1, 2022~Go to a different location! They don't let you use the bathroom here so they expect you to buy their food and their drinks but they don't bother letting you use their restroom. I'm so sick of this. I would say skip this location and go to one who will let you use the facilities. If only I could give zero stars.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Feb 2, 2021~Everyone in here is always friendly. Super happy to help. They move fast and have seen them be cool to the rudest customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Nov 20, 2020~Sweetest guy ever working drive thru today 11/20Made my day whole day before heading into work.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Oct 5, 2022~They don't open their lobby anymore. No signs. No indication that they keep their lobby closed. So I showed up to go inside and read a book and drink a coffee and find out the doors locked.  I decide to run through the drive thru get my coffee and sit and watch from the chipotle next door. Every five minutes, someone pulls up gets out of their car pulls on the door looks around and can't figure out why the doors are locked. Because there are no signs saying the lobby is closed. Let me be clear... if that many people are showing up pulling on the door every few minutes... STARBUCKS IT IS YOUR FAULT FOR NOT MAKING IT CLEAR THAT YOU DONT WANT TO USE YOUR LOBBY ANYMORE. When you look up this location there is a beautiful picture of the lobby. So if you're going to advertise the lobby you should either have it open or take down every picture of your lobby and say the lobby is closed. I really thought that was common sense but I guess I was wrong.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Apr 22, 2022~First time to this Starbucks and I was sooo impresses by Alyssa who took my order ...her attitude is amazing ...she is great!!!Thank you Alyssa!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~May 17, 2021~I had to stop and get myself the iced cinnamon Dolce Latte.  The best!!! I cannot get enough of this stuff.  The baristas here are the best.  Very courteous and go the extra mile to make you happy.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Dec 31, 2019~This Starbucks location is officially known to my family as the `"we're out of that`" Starbucks. Staff is friendly, location is super convenient for me as it's right by my house and right by the I-17 on ramp. My issue with this location is exactly why I call it `"we're out of that`" Starbucks. I've gone there on 4 different occasions where they've been out of the one thing that I want to order. Twice (on two different weeks) they were out of Matcha and couldn't make my wife's iced green tea latte. Two other times I went to order their iced Irish cream latte and immediately I'm interrupted with `"sorry we're out of that`". I'm an occasional Starbucks customer. Maybe I go twice a month for drinks for me and my family. I've almost completely given up on this location because it's so hit or miss whether they will have what I want. I'd rather just drive an extra few blocks to another location that always seems to have everything in stock. It's disappointing because I was so excited to have this location open so close to my home. They really need to get their inventory in order. Being right by the freeway I imagine their demand is high with people stopping by to and from work or on their way somewhere. All the more they should be ordering enough product to meet the demand but they don't seem to have that figured out for whatever reason. Go ahead and roll the dice on this location if you have to, just be prepared to have to drive to another location to get what you really want.  With that said, if they fix this issue of always running out of popular menu items, this review can be changed to 4-5 star review because the few times when I've made a successful order, the drinks have always been on point.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Nov 4, 2019~Went 2 days in a row and they made the drinks wrong. Right info on cup but wrong in the cup. The 2 ND day was a drive through. I ordered soy in my iced coffee. Started drinking it and realized it was milk. Said soy on it. Was sick the rest of the day.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Dec 17, 2019~My favorite location! The staff is so sweet and speedy. Anthony has the best customer service and  always brightens up my mornings.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Feb 21, 2020~Very clean starbucks! Was here on a short trip visiting from LA had a great conversation with a super cute barista named Riley she's very good at her job and also the staff is pleasant overall would come here again next time I'm in AZ with my friends
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Apr 6, 2019~I love Starbucks. I got the double bacon cheddar cause I was super Hungary and the grande java chip which as usual didn't disappoint. I just wish that the sandwiches had time to cool and were served with the coffe cause the sandwiches were too hot to eat at first. They need time to cool so people don't burn their mouth. The bathroom needs paper towels by the door for those of us who don't like touching the door handle after just washing our hands, please? I did, however, appreciate the metal sharps container. Overall, it was a great experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Oct 28, 2019~Kirstie, was exceptionally nice this morning and the whole team was awesome. Monday off to a great start!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Oct 1, 2020~I went here yesterday morning to have my coffee because the one by my house was too busy. I got a hazelnut flat white and for the first time in a long time it came out perfect! It even had the dot it's supposed to have. The girl Alyssa took her time and asked me how I was. Everyone here seemed really genuine and it was a great atmosphere! Will definitely be coming back!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jan 10, 2021~This starbucks on Bell Rd and I17 is the only one I will go to. The staff is always so amazing, go out of their way to have a personable conversation with you and make you feel very welcomed. I really hope they see these reviews to see how much of an awesome job they do every single day. I never have once had a bad experience! Keep up the amazing work!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jun 3, 2020~I love this Starbucks! Every employee is super sweet, especially Jonathan and Isaac! They're efficient and so friendly. Keep it up!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~May 13, 2019~This is my Number One Favorite Starbucks of all time. They understand the concept of EXTRA Caramel, and never once got any of my orders wrong (even when I ask for extras).
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Oct 6, 2019~If any baristas need an example of a clean friendly coffee place this Starbucks is it. The staff there are some of the nicest I've ever met. Very kind and accommodating. My favorite when I go through drive thru is Anthony. He's so welcoming and kind. Can't say enough nice things about him. My favorite Starbucks. BTW I work at another Starbucks but prefer this place hands down
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Aug 6, 2019~The fact I lighter roasts didn't even phase the enjoyment I had when drinking this cup, of course I was indecisive so I went with a great caramel macchiato. Though most frown upon the `"McDonald's`" of coffee I couldn't help but enjoy the awkward yet extremely kind baristas at this location.
Ste 100~5~Oct 1, 2024~The staff were absolutely amazing!!! I pulled up a specialty drink on Google and they were more than willing to help me out! Best of all, it was absolutely delicious!!! I will be returning!!!
Ste 100~2~Dec 21, 2023~Redone interior but basically they got rid of all indoor seating!! And to top it off no misters or heaters outside which means great for drive thru and That's it
Ste 100~4~May 31, 2014~Great drive thru and decent interior. Friendly staff and perfectly made drinks. Outdoor patio area.  Nice location.
Ste 100~5~Jan 8, 2024~Love me some Starbucks. Every store can be different but this one is always on top. The customer service is always great, and the drinks are always made right. Often times something isn't the same at each Starbucks which can be frustrating. However Everytime I've been at this location everything has been great. I always go for iced drinks, so the shaken espresso is always my go to. You can change the syrups and different things to customize it. I love Starbucks. I will always go back here for my coffee fix. The food and cups are also great at Starbucks.
Ste 100~4~Feb 1, 2023~The Starbucks experience has been pretty standard wherever I go. I am a little disappointed with how corporate Starbucks keeps changing out the menu for food items. I really liked the chicken artichoke sandwich. I added an older photo of a Star bucks item I really enjoyed.  It has unfortunately been discontinued. I also really liked the fall drink, the apple spice. I am so sad that they don't have the chicken and quinoa salad anymore. The chicken &amp; quinoa salad came with black beans and greens. It was 27 g of protein per bowl that included chicken raised without antibiotics. It has 1.5 cups of vegetables. The grilled white meat chicken was on top of a spring mix, quinoa, tomato vinaigrette, and cotija cheese. More specifics on the rest of the ingredients are as follows: white meat chicken raised without antibiotics (white meat chicken, water, salt, potato starch, onion and garlic powder, spice) spring mix (contains one or more of the following: lettuce, chard spinach tatso radicchio), quinoa blend (water, vinegar (white red) mild chile vinaigrette tomato puree (water, tomato pastel, pomace olive oil, honey. red and ancho chile puree (red bell pepper, water, dehydrated red chile peppers, dehydrated ancho chile pepper, lemon juice concentrate], roasted red bell peppers, apple cider vinegar salt, contains 2% or less of: lemon juice concentrate. spices, garlic, mustard flour black pepper, natural flavor), tomatoes, black beans (black beans. water salt calgium chloride ferrous gluconate), fire-griled corn (super sweet corn, olive oil, canola oil jicama. cotta cheese (pasteurized milk. sail, enzymes, culture, powdered cellulose. I can only hope they bring it back. When I asked at the store they didn't think it was coming back. I can always hope.
Ste 100~3~Feb 7, 2024~Had stopped there and take a coffee. Its good location however service was not that quick as I expected. The staff was nice though. I did takeout some pastries too. It was well-baked and the quality was so amazing. I love my coffee balanced flavor and has smooth flavor. Price was good.
Ste 100~3~Feb 1, 2024~Friendly service! I like this Starbuck location. They  make freshly brewed coffee. It smell so good and has well-balanced flavor. The Pastries were great and well-baked. The place has nice ambiance and good seating.
Ste 100~3~Mar 9, 2021~SB in large shopping center that does not allow indoor seating. The patio was dirty and needed cleaning. Baristas were not friendly.Below avg Starbucks.
Ste 100~2~May 23, 2024~Who gets rid of interior seating in a place like AZ? This doesn't make sense for the area or for a coffee shop in general. Starbucks lost its way.
Ste 100~1~Dec 27, 2023~Absolutely terrible service. Never coming here, you'll be disappointed. Lots of other options neatby.
Ste 100~1~Feb 14, 2023~Been here many times, and seems like all this place wants to sell is milk with a splash of coffee... ordering a drink from here is like the hunger games, `"May the odds be ever in your favor!`"
Ste 100~5~May 12, 2022~I actually really like this location. They are consistent, friendly, clean and actually remember us. There is something nice about having a neighborhood place to drive thru or stop by and share a beverage. There is a lot of value in that outside just the drink. Good peeps
Ste 100~1~May 1, 2023~Service was awful and the cashier lady was rude. I know it's the morning but geez. I don't expect everyone to be happy in the morning but I don't expect to be dogged out either. Wont be coming back.
Ste 100~5~Aug 27, 2021~I came in early on a Friday and had to leave for work without my drink. The baristas working asked me to come back in later to get my drink or a refund ( no biggie I didn't allow myself enough time) I came in later at lunch and requested my drink which they made, and then Angie and a tall blonde gentleman (I didn't catch his name) both gave me a gift card for a drink! Y'all are seriously the best! Thank you for your excellent customer service!!!
Ste 100~1~Jun 10, 2023~Baristas are not trained by Starbucks on how to make beverages here. The Macchiato was nowhere close to on that is made elsewhere. Even the caramel Frappuccino had neither any coffee taste or coconut milk. Very rushed baristas not knowing what they are doing here. Where is management as they are literally running into into each other when making these drinks.
Ste 100~5~Jul 5, 2022~I will always chose this location over the others in the area. The baristas are always so nice and fast. The drinks are always made perfectly! I appreciate you guys sm!
Ste 100~2~Nov 29, 2022~Legit the worst Starbucks in north Phoenix. If your name is `"fallon`", you need a new job. 1. Waited 35 minutes in the drive thru- and if you have ever been here, you know there's no turning back once you're in line. You're committed whether you like it or not. 2. After 35 minutes of waiting- I was given the wrong pastry. Despite my bag saying the correct order, what was in the bag was NOT what I ordered. 3. Worker was very confused when I came inside and asked for my correct order. Manager had to actually yell `"Fallon, just get her the correct danish`" while she still looked around confused. 4. Another manager comes out and tries to chit chat with me about my `"turkey day`" while incompetent Fallon looks for my order then whispers `"I think we're out of danish`"5. I walk out, lady is walking in with a pastry bag, I ask her if it's my order and she said yes. Our pastries got switched. We switched in the parking lot and called it a day. 6. No apology for making people wait 35 minutes for a freaking coffee. That's absolutely insane.
Ste 100~5~Jan 27, 2022~The best starbies in N Phx. Always top quality and super fast drive through, even during peak!
Ste 100~1~Jul 13, 2022~Rude baristas working on 7/13/22 1230pm.  Didn't ask for the carrier, yet they gave one, held three venti's and one trenta drink, broke apart didn't even apologize just an attitude.  Bad customer service!
Ste 100~4~Feb 16, 2018~After my 1 hr massage at Massage Envy which is next door. I popped over to this Starbucks location to sit down to do some work on their WiFi since I'm tracking on business.  Service was fast, friendly, and my order was perfect.  I had a chicken capresse sandwich for lunch, BBQ chips, and a Mocha Frapp.However I was disappointed that they had no comfy chairs. Everything in this store is wood chairs or metal stools.  I love eating and drinking coffee while sitting back in a comfy chair when I stop in Starbucks.  But oh well.  They have tons of out door seating and patio space. But I sat inside because it was chilly out.
Ste 100~1~Dec 18, 2022~They handed me my drink and it spilled all over the outside of my car, all over me &amp; the inside of it. I asked for them to remake it because it's a $8 drink &amp; when she brought it back out to me she said `"Is this good enough for you.`" I called back to complain and the guy was extremely rude &amp; cutting me off, His explanation that it wasn't their fault the lids don't fit the cup on a $8 drink. So unprofessional &amp; rude. Avoid this location.
Ste 100~5~Dec 2, 2021~Theeee best customer service I have ever gotten from a Starbucks or any coffee shop for that matter! Andrea was super attentive and made great conversation! She was genuinely caring and polite! I promise I am not exaggerating when I say she gave the best customer service to where you want to go back to just because of the service! Andrea set the expectation of how all Starbucks employees should be, truly awesome job and many thanks to her! With her attitude I hope she is the manager or working her way up to that position! happy employees means happy customers!! :)
Ste 100~4~Nov 3, 2018~I'd honestly rate this location a 4.5 and was super happy for a place to sit outside and study while enjoying some coffee and good weather. Bonus that I scored one of the refillable holiday cups on this day. Sometimes the other guests can be inconsiderate like the one listening to her loud iPad soap operas with no headphones on which is really disruptive and annoying to the other patrons. She's been the exception here though. Usually it's pretty pleasant
Ste 100~1~Dec 30, 2018~Went into this Starbucks and witnessed the lead, Peter (either a shift lead or manager, I don't know) openly and loudly refusing to give his one female employee her break because it was `"busy`" (there weren't many people in the store)and because she was asking for her break since she'd been there so long. He specifically said the more she asked him for her break the longer he was going to refuse it to her. He then proceeded to offer a break to his other male employees, until one refused and let the female employee go in his place. This is hugely unprofessional, demeaning, and comes off completely disgusting. Peter needs to re evaluate how he treats his employees/coworkers and maybe receive some management classes. If this was a problem with the employee(which maybe there was a problem, I obviously did not see an entire days worth of interaction) it should be dealt with professionally and not so loudly that all customers are actively watching what's happening.
Ste 100~5~Dec 9, 2019~This location is known for amazing service. Peter, one of the managers is well known for going the extra mile to make customers feel welcome.The bartista's are fast and accurately providing each order. And they laugh at my jokes!
Ste 100~2~Sep 8, 2016~I'm an avid fan of Starbucks &amp; I will admit this is the first time I have had an issue with the actual coffee. Unfortunately I didn't notice until I had already driven 30 minutes to my work... I had coffee grounds at the bottom of my coffee. And not like a few that  I could just ignore but enough that I was continuously sucking it up my straw (see photo). I expected high quality coffee &amp; received a coffee that a novice would make.
Ste 100~5~Jun 4, 2016~May Not Be The Fastest.... but they make a great Iced White Chocolate  MochaA nice start to the day This Starbucks is not my usual stop however, it just might be my favorite. I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks iced white chocolate mocha, I can't think of anything and vanilla scone.The service at this Starbucks might not be the fastest but it's still phenomenal and the staff are always very friendly. This location is clean, inviting, and feels comfortable and they have seating outside at the patio.My coffee was made exactly the way I order and tasted great. In addition, to the great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack. I really enjoy grabbing a cake pop or two to go.Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.
Ste 100~3~Feb 23, 2023~I'm giving a 2 star review because I have had some pleasant experiences at this store, but my most recent ones have caused me to stop coming here. Since I work at Starbucks, I understand the rushes especially in the morning, but I do not understand harsh demeanor towards someone who is completely understanding. I recently got here around 9am, placing my order of 4 standard drinks 25 minutes prior to my arrival. When I get to the window, I have to keep reminding the barista after each drink she hands me that I have more. After about 6 minutes, I finally have 3 drinks, to which I say I am just waiting on one more. She goes on to say that I keep `"adding`" drinks onto my order, although I had ordered all 4 of them in one mobile order. Her and another barista proceed to talk back to me claiming that I keep changing the number of drinks. Their tones got harsher as I stayed at the window. I kept saying that I had one more drink I was waiting on, but they claimed I already got all 4 drinks when I only had 3 in my car. Finally, they managed to find one of my drinks thrown away, which is why the label was missing. That drink was a Sugar Cookie Almondmilk Latte, but what I found out they gave me was just a plain latte with regular milk when I tried it later. Not only did I get talked back to numerous times, but I also received at least one completely incorrect drink.
Ste 100~2~Sep 2, 2018~I try to avoid this starbucks, though drinks almost always come out correctly but customer service has been very spotty and more bad than good. More robotic answers and nothing personalized anymore. I reordered my coffee today through the app, walked by the bar to pick it up, one employee was standing right there reading something and barista was behind the machine,  and another employee Behind the bar, i greeted everyone with a `"good morning`", and I have a loud voice so I'm sure they heard me, but I got no response, then checked my coffee cup to make sure it's move, said `"thank you guys`" and the same, no response. Not sure what happened there but really felt I welcomed and unwanted. The 2 stars is for the coffee prep as it was correctly made.
Ste 100~5~Mar 1, 2022~Awesome customer service, always cheerful. Great communication and the staff makes you feel at home. It is the Starbucks my family chooses to go to when we come into town.
Ste 100~1~Feb 25, 2022~If i could give this starbucks 0 stars I would. They charged us for two extra food items. We waiting nearly twenty minutes for two iced coffees and two pastries. Our drinks WERE HORRIBLE. Had to throw them away. We couldn't go back because we were going to be late to work because we had to stand in line TWICE to get a refund already. Horrible horrible horrible. Will never go back
Ste 100~2~Mar 9, 2019~When you first order your drinks, they're really nice and friendly. Past that, the drinks are good, &amp; terrible customer service. I just came in for 2 drinks and food before work. Two of the workers were rude, and left me standing there. They didn't tell me my drink my ready, or even noticed I had been standing there. And finally I asked if they were my drinks the girl Ana looked at me and said `"oh yeah you can take them`" Like ok??????They only catered to their regulars, I have to remind myself to drive 20 minutes out of my way to another starbucks next time.
Ste 100~5~Dec 22, 2017~On Christmas weekend needed a refreshing drink in between wrapping gifts and the drive - thru convenience was ideal to satisfy my quench ! Also thank bring open until midnight
Ste 100~4~Dec 6, 2017~I always stop by this starbucks on my way to work on weekends, or when I need a substantial amount of coffee and to study. Staff at this location is great. They are always willing to recommend new ways of trying my iced coffee!
Ste 100~1~Aug 8, 2017~I swear, ever since Starbucks got rid of the traditional hand-pulled espresso machines, the drink quality has gone down the toilet. I'm reviewing the SBUX I visited today, but it pretty much applies to them all. Out of the last 10 drinks I ordered, 9 were either wrong in some way or just sucked. The employees have no pride in what they do because there's no skill involved in pushing buttons vs. crafting an awesome drink. When I worked there in 2000, things were different. If you had the skill to make quality drinks quickly, you were on bar. If you sucked, you mostly did cashiering and support duties. We CARED about what we put out, and people loved us. 20+ cups lined up on the bar at any given time during the morning rush, 90% were for daily regulars. Mistakes and dissatisfaction were extremely rare. I had a drink sent back once. The guy claimed his latte wasn't 140 degrees. I plopped a thermometer in it, showed him, and handed it back. He was a regular and should have known better.This is why I rarely go to SBUX! I don't need the hassle and frustration. It ruins a good two hours of my day. Why pay $6 for that? Yet I still go from time to time, and 9/10 of those times I am disappointed.I feel like an idiot for handing the girl a tip in the drive-thru before I got my drink. I should have looked. I would have seen that no, she did not put a dome lid and extra caramel sauce on top like she said she would. That's not the cardinal sin that's prompting this review though. I ordered my drink non-fat, and I was given whole milk. That's not cool! At all! Not only do I hate the taste of a creamy caramel macchiato, I really don't want the extra fat (and whole milk has a LOT of fat). So besides now having a drink that I absolutely don't want, I don't have time to turn around and have it corrected, and I HATE wasting things, so I am obligated to gain a few pounds by drinking this crap. I posted pictures. You can see the sticker says non-fat and the drink is laced with the creamy white fat of whole milk. Tastes gross to me.*I apologize to the good SBUX employees out there. In the event I go again (which is inevitable), I won't be tipping you. It's because you are so few and far between, and I'm done tipping your co-workers who don't take pride in doing a good job.*
Ste 100~5~Oct 26, 2021~Came in needed a hot coffee at 6:30ish under $4 they got it made in less then a minute and were the most enthusiastic people I've ever met great great place highly recommend
Ste 100~1~Dec 22, 2019~12/21/2019, Saturday at 4:30 pm. Used the drive-thru. Our turn to order. We ordered a Citrus Defender/Honey Citrus Mint Tea (M-ball), we were told they were all out of the teas they made it with so we ordered a Mocha   Frappuccino we were told they were out of ice but were still willing to make it with no ice. Now, how in the heck are you going to make a Mocha Frap with no ice and why would you even suggest it? We had to wait for 18 mins to get through the drive-thru with nothing. Unacceptable.
Ste 100~1~Jun 9, 2017~My wife and I love going to Starbucks for iced tea later in the evening. I have been here previously and I order the large black tea mango lemonade. Every time it's different. The most recent time they forgot to put in the lemonade and the mango. When u spend $5.00 on tea it better be right. Hopefully they get there stuff together.
Ste 100~2~Sep 27, 2013~THE SLOWEST AND WEAKEST WIFI of ANY Starbucks!Slow Drive-thruOnly one register open even with long lines.
Ste 100~1~Apr 24, 2013~incredibly slow drive thru.  workers at drive-thru are not friendly or quick.
Ste 100~1~Dec 3, 2019~Me and my son both got a Starbucks and we got really sick not sure if they are  leaving the milk out or what's going on but the manager needs to look into this
Ste 100~5~Apr 5, 2017~Always efficient and friendly. They always get my orders right. Nothing really bad to say. I come here when I am in town visiting.
Ste 100~5~Jan 18, 2018~Well after a slow start up my Starbuck's gets great reviews. Oh, and BTW Starbuck's finally got it right for those of us who want a decent, fast, bread free breakfast.Their new egg bites are the best!!! Two for over four dollars but 170 calories. Served very cute for those of us on the move. Egg white bites are also good but my fav is the bacon cheese. What a great accompaniment to my morning ice coffee.
Ste 100~5~Nov 27, 2018~I absolutely love coming to this Starbucks. The employees are always friendly! Especially Peter; Peter goes out of his way to make personal connections with his customers. He will remember your face and treat you kindly every time you come in. Overall the staff provides a great welcoming environment!
Ste 100~5~Apr 10, 2018~My Happy place before work in the mornings! Great customer service. I  definitely recommend stopping by this location and getting a coffee. You wont regret it!
Ste 100~1~May 2, 2019~I'm never really impressed with their baristas but the location is super convenient. My biggest issue is when I went to get a coffee today. I decided to switch it up because my app has been telling me that I've had a reward for over 3 weeks now. What a great way to start my morning! I drove there in my jammies to start my wonderful day with a fancy coffee. However, Starbucks changed their rewards and I only got a few dimes off. I still paid over 5 bucks for my drink! I was very confused... and Angie was very smug.  She told me that the rewards changed Tuesday. That's dumb! Then, why have i had a reward for weeks? She was very unprofessional in her response of `"I don't make the rules.`" I didn't say you made the rules, ANGIE! You may not make the rules but you are there to provide good customer service which you failed to do. Starbucks app was deleted and this one was uploaded.
Ste 100~3~Jun 24, 2019~Customer service was good but didn't exactly get what I wanted. Just be sure to confirm your drink before you accept it and drive off... cause if not you'll be a bit upset that you spent that money on it.
Ste 100~5~Oct 23, 2015~I love this location. My drink has always been ON POINT! And the drive through is the fastest Starbucks drive through I've ever gone to. I like the location even though its a little bit off the road. They have a cute little patio, and a nice (typical) interior. The girls have always been friendly here as well. I wish I lived a little closer to this one. But its always the one (out of the 5 I pass) I stop at on my way to work once to twice a week.
Ste 100~5~Aug 23, 2018~Shout out to Brandy and the team for making my experience awesome.  Super friendly and helpful.  Green tea matcha latte was perfect! Never been to this location but highly recommend
Ste 100~5~Mar 3, 2019~Had the best experience at the Bucks tonight. Got two drinks for my friends who were with me and we sat and talked with Maestro for a few minutes. Such a funny and relatable guy! I wish there were more of him around. Highly recommend!
Ste 100~1~Oct 13, 2018~Apparently I'm not the only one. This place is dirty. I was standing with several other people that commented along with me at this place was filthy. Maybe next time you visit here you shouldn't go through a drive-thru. You might have a better understanding of what's going on . gross!
Ste 100~1~Sep 23, 2015~This is the closest location to my home but this is a Starbucks I Avoid!!! Having worked for Starbucks for many years in Washington state my addiction to good coffee runs deep and I am Very Familiar with how customers should be treated! This location is the Worst I have ever encountered and I vow never to support that location with any of my revenue. I went in for a pound of coffee and had it ground for a cone filter. Next morning opened the bag to find baby powder fine coffee. I went immediately to the store and asked to exchange it and have it ground again. The partner at the register was unhelpful and at first wanted a receipt but I stated I didn't have it plus I only wanted to get another pound not cash. She accommodated my request but with obvious unpleasant attitude. Next morning same baby fine powder to fine for my machine. I return again...trying to be pleasant I suggest that perhaps they need to recalibrate the grinder which can get off after time. The shift supervisor exchanged the coffee but Refused to Grind it because apparently I'm difficult to please!!! What!!!!When I managed a Starbucks I would have 1. Apologize for the inconvenience of coming in several times! 2. Grind a bit made sure it was correct with the customer then grind the pound. 3. Offered a cup of brewed coffee while they waited!! That was in the 90s when they really Trained Baristas now it seems sadly that Starbucks has lost it's Soul for Service. Very Sad example of that is at this location for sure!! Drive on to the Thunderbird location which is better.
Ste 100~1~Dec 25, 2020~Today was very upsetting going to this Starbucks. I understand it gets crazy during the holidays, let alone Christmas. However, the employees working on Christmas could have handled this situation A LOT better. I ordered over the mobile app because I figured it they would've been crazy busy and this would've made the process a whole lot easier. So I ordered at 4:10pm and it was supposed to be ready at 4:17pm. Mind you, they closed earlier today due to it obviously being Christmas. So I went to go pick up my three drinks and food and see the line was practically to the other side of the parking lot where sprouts is. I was shocked but assumed I could go inside to quickly pick up my TO GO drinks and leave. Turns out they closed the lobby completely. I called just to clarify I have to pick up my mobile order in the drive through, no one answered. So considering I already paid for my drink (and my sister paid for hers and I was also picking her online order up) I had to wait in the drive through. No problem! It's Christmas, what do you expect? I sit in line for almost half an hour and at this point I am parked right in the drive through, right as you enter, SO CLOSE! That's when I see three Starbucks employees come out carrying those chairs they have on their patio and set four of them right in front of my CAR. IT WAS 4:45pm!! When I had rolled down my window and politely asked the barista how I would get my money back from my mobile order, she said `"I don't know maybe call Starbucks`" and walked away. Wow. They had another 15 minutes before they closed and they cut off I would guesstimate about 15 cars behind me. I understand it's the holidays and the employees want to be with their families BUT they handled this situation horribly. Very truly disappointed in this Starbucks considering I have been coming here for years. I paid for multiple drinks and food almost an hour ahead of time and NEVER got them. I know what it's like to work on Christmas and in customer service and I know they've probably had some rude customers today so I'm sure the baristas were overwhelmed but I truly felt the need to do this review and I have never reviewed anyone before so I just hope we can all do better.
Ste 100~2~Oct 9, 2015~Meh. I only go to this location while I am at work because it is within walking distance. If time permits, I swing by the new location on Thunderbird and 19th while I'm on my way to work.This location is consistent and I never really have a long wait. However their customer service sucks. They aren't very friendly and get irritated when you ask questions. I was in there today and while waiting for my tea, I witnessed some employees screwing around and put cups on top of their heads? What are we, 5? They're lucky I work in the plaza and that I get flourished with gift cards, otherwise I would go elsewhere. Forever hoping a Dutch Bros or Teavana opens close by!
Ste 100~1~Apr 23, 2020~Employees are wearing mask but not gloves?? Handing out wet drinks with bare hands? Isn't that going to cause transmission of the virus? CDC says most infections are from touching something and then your face.
Ste 100~5~Jan 20, 2015~Love Coffee!, Friendly Drive-ThruThis location is ALWAYS packed with a line of cars but that never scares me at this location, they are super fast and friendly!
Ste 100~3~Oct 8, 2014~Didn't allow me to put up business cards for pet sittin, but all the other Starbucks in Scottsdale do?Www.ArizonaHappyPaws.com
Ste 100~1~Mar 23, 2018~Let's make this short and easy. Walked up to the register no one greeted us. 4 partners were in a conversation, looked at us and continued with their conversation. Finally after i made contact with one of them they took my order with minimal interaction. Waited for my drinks. Girl on bar slide over drinks across the bar without calling them out. No name // no drink label. She was still in conversation. When did work place become all talk and no work? Btw. Only that one girl on bar had an apron and sh made my ice coffee wrong. She was too busy talking for me to correct her. Please get better employees. Better people need jobs
Ste 100~5~Feb 26, 2020~Love this Starbucks! Here every other week for a Bible study. Peter is the best barista! Really caring, super attentive to detail and amazing memory!
Ste 100~2~Oct 2, 2017~The coffee is great, it always has been, especially when you get one for free! I'm very pleased I get to enjoy a salted caramel mocha hot AND iced. Although, the outcome had turned out for the better on my end, I'd much rather they got it right the first time. The staff this morning weren't exactly starbuck standard quality staff. They normally greet you; and believe it or not, when you order they actually pay attention to your order. You'll even here a, `"thanks for coming!`" on your way out.. Well, not this location. Happy Monday!
Ste 100~4~Dec 5, 2010~This was my 3rd time coming to this location in about a year. I came with my friend Jess after a movie. We both got the caramel brulee frappucino. She got the chocolate croissant &amp; I wanted to try the vanilla bean scones but they were out, again. So I got the marshmallow dream bar &amp; iced lemon pound cake. This was my 1st time eating outside though. The tables were all a bit dirty but it was a nice day to sit outside &amp; chat for a lil. I docked a star for being out of stuff &amp; the outside tables being dirty.
Ste 100~2~Dec 14, 2014~Painfully slow. It's not okay to be slow during the morning rush. The cashiers could get customers through quickly but could not serve quickly. Communication between the staff seemed lost. The woman at serving counter asked what I ordered 10 mins after I paid. She had to ask someone to get it started, so I'm glad she asked because it seemed as if no one knew I even ordered it. Not sure if this is what it's like going through the drive-thru but I don't think I'll be returning.
Ste 100~1~Jan 16, 2018~Been to this location twice. Both times my order was incorrect. The second mistake was worse than the first. The staff appears amateurish and unsure. They all look lost.
Ste 100~3~Sep 25, 2016~They have friendly staff but can't seem to really follow direction. If someone is asking for something specific weather it be Iced, light iced, sweetened, unsweetened or perhaps 7 scoops instead of 3 you should do as asked. These drinks are not cheap especially when you order them every morning (it starts to add up) I find this very offensive that when I asked for my drink to be made a certain way I get it the way you want to make it. This happens at least 3x a week with this location. Make the drinks how they are ordered and not how you'd like too. I get that you a very busy but you are also busy because of the business that we bring to you.
Ste 100~4~Feb 9, 2012~If you hate people who are really cheerful early in the morning, do not come here; it is staffed by the brightest-eyed and bushiest-tailed baristas I have ever seen. For me, at least, the positive and pleasant interaction with other humans is as much of a pick-me-up as the coffee. I can't speak for the other patrons.Otherwise, a Starbucks is a Starbucks is a Starbucks.
Ste 100~4~Jan 25, 2011~I'm not a coffee person so I always end up getting tea. But, place was quiet, clean, and friendly. What more can I say - it was a Starbucks?
Ste 100~3~Sep 8, 2012~I mean it's a typical Starbucks, nothing really stands out about it.The drive through isn't the quickest, but the baristas are always very  friendly. I am grateful for the drive through either way, because some other Starbucks that are convenient to my routes don't have one! Also, since it's in a rather busy stretch of Bell Rd, it's easy to forget it's there. Look for Pei Wei, and keep heading towards Greenway Pkwy.My order has never been wrong, so that's also a plus.I get iced green or passion tea 90% of the time, green tea frap with soy the other 10%, always tasty!
Ste 100~5~Jan 19, 2019~The drive thru is always pretty pick quick. The blonde woman with the glasses that works the drive thru window in the morning (usually Fridays) is always very nice. I probably go about one or two times a week to this location and she's started to remember me.
Ste 100~1~Mar 22, 2016~I have gone to this location many times because it is very convenient and I always order a triple espresso with caramel drizzle. I feel that this is a very simple order and not a soul in the world would be able to mess it up. Apparently, I was wrong on multiple occasions. Yes, it is my responsibility to let them know if my order is wrong but I think that someone who gets a triple espresso wrong multiple times shouldn't be working at a coffee shop. Not only that, but each time I have received two shots instead of three. I'm never going there again.
Ste 100~1~Sep 19, 2019~I use to go the extra mile to come to this Starbucks because everything I ordered was excellent. This past month my coffee has tasted so bad that I've had to ask to remake my drink every visit. I kept thinking maybe someone was new so I would go back and try again. It's been terrible, I'm done giving this Starbucks chances. If you're into burned tasting coffee, this is the place for you!
Ste 100~5~Apr 28, 2017~Always friendly and fast Enjoying my coffee date with my husband. Our first day off in a long time. And always starbucks to start off our day `"Feelin' that vibe in a Beat of a Coffee!!!!!`" Wooohooooo!!!!!
Ste 100~3~Dec 14, 2016~The male barista with a man bun was having some internal struggle the last time we went in. He was being a real jerk while we were ordering... Terrible customer service coming from that man. Usually a pretty decent Starbucks other than this specific time. Fast service
Ste 100~5~Dec 8, 2018~Best customer service I've ever gotten at a Starbucks was right here! All of the baristas are friendly, seem happy to be there and to share their interest in coffee. Special shout-outs must be given to Mase - who wears glasses and a beanie - who advised me on the amazingness of blonde ristretto shots. This Starbucks seems to really get it with the customer service.
Ste 100~5~Nov 5, 2016~I go to this location every weekend. Always good service. This weekend my sister is here from Virginia. She wanted a regular coffee with cream and sugar. I decided on a Venti Pumpkin Spice. Great service and coffee.
Ste 100~1~Feb 8, 2017~First Starbucks I've been in where I came away saying that the place was filthy. Sorry but true!
Ste 100~2~Jul 3, 2015~I hate writing a bad review... The last two times I have gone through their drive through I ask for an Americano with 2 inches of steamed half-and-half... Both times I get my beverage and I'm halfway home and realize they have not put a drop of half-and-half in.  So I drive back to walk inside to tell them. And they do offer an apology.. Not one time did they offer to comp my drink even though they've wasted about 15 minutes of my time getting home and then getting back just to get my half-and-half.  Not only that but the second time I tell them, they continue to make about seven drinks before they get to mine... The people seem nice but as far as customer service goes I give them 2 stars
Ste 100~1~Feb 6, 2019~Went inside on a Sunday afternoon, not busy. However every table/chair was taken but clearly not everyone was a customer. Order a simple grande hot chocolate with whipped cream. After an unfriendly greeting and service I waited 20 minutes for my beverage. Which I had to put my own hot guard around my cup, get my own stirrer, and grab my own straw! Walked away with no acknowledgement from the barista. Went outside to make my way to my car, opened the lid to stir, it was filled up half way with no whipped cream!! Why pay for a grande and receive a size tall?! And too lazy to spray whipped cream on top to cover your other laziness of not filling it up all the way?! What a joke this place was! Never coming to this location again, apparently I ask for too much with a $4 hot chocolate sheesh! Seeing how there's a Starbucks on every corner...just go to different better one!
Ste 100~2~Sep 28, 2015~I came for the grate coffee and they forgot to put the sweetness, and the patio it was dirty , and need an update. Looks just like a table in a dirty sidewalk. And they wear a table of guys making a big noise playing dominos.
Ste 100~4~Aug 10, 2015~Quick,  friendly,  consistent.  Never any problems here. Usually have the pastries in stock aND drive through lune moves fast. Thanks!
Ste 100~5~Dec 4, 2016~By far my favotite Starbucks. I  now live a block away from a Starbucks, and still drive 30 min to come to this one. Huge shout out to the staff and especially Christy. Thank you for everything
Ste 100~5~Mar 28, 2018~We love Starbucks! Great drinks and they are always consistent. This location has friendly staff. Love the drive-through too.
Ste 100~5~Jun 9, 2012~Love this place in the morning....they are friendly.and great to work with and never get my drink wrong.
Ste 100~2~Dec 19, 2012~Ummmm... can I please get some iced coffee with my soy milk? Two times in a row that I could barely taste the coffee in my drink. The quality of drink is not worth the long wait in the drive through. The wait in the drive thru is always lengthy. If I ever visit this location again I will consider bringing a travel size board game.
Ste 100~5~Jun 16, 2015~Super friendly staff last night. Just sweet people. It makes a difference really. Went late around 830pm and was able to get a drink for the lady who had a rough day. Good job ladies and thanks again.
Ste 100~1~Aug 1, 2018~I went to this starbucks earlier and ordered a pineapple tea infused lemonade and a mango dragonfruit refresher. i got a peach tea lemonade and a strawberry green tea instead. the guy red head at the window was very rude and acted like my service meant nothing. I think every time I visit this location I get horrible service and they always get my order wrong. I've never had an experience at this location where they get my order right, or seem like they enjoy working there at all.
Ste 100~1~Jul 3, 2014~seriously the slowest drive-thru with the poorest customer service! I am lucky if my drink is ever correct! Guess I am the fool for coming here every few times in hoping that they have improved! Another fail on July 3 at 2:37 PM :)
Ste 100~5~Jan 6, 2015~This is the only Starbucks that treats their customers with a great attitude and great smiles, I got a grande white mocha frap and it was super fast and friendly, I enjoy the drive thru, when I get a break at work and want something cold, this is where I come to..good job guys!!
Ste 100~5~Nov 23, 2015~I work very close to this Starbucks location. I go through the drive thru almost every morning, and the line is always very long, BUT the staff is so quick on making everyone's drinks. They also make them perfect every time!!!
Ste 100~5~Nov 20, 2011~Some of the best service of any Starbucks - reasonably fast with an upbeat smile to help start my day on the right foot.  Has some of the `"local`" coffee shop vibe to it, even though it is a chain.
Ste 100~5~Sep 12, 2015~I absolutely love this location. The baristas are amazing. Peter is so friendly and actually one of the reasons I am a returning customer at this location. Friendly faces, fast service, and great beverages!
Ste 100~5~Mar 21, 2014~Really good service and coffee. My sister and I both tried hot hazelnut macchiatos for the first time. The weather was basically right in between hot and cold so we had a hard time figuring out which temperature drink to get. Our stepmom got a java chip frappuchino and after taking a sip we almost regretted getting the hot macchiatos. But then after sitting with the decision for a little bit (and taking a few more macchiato sips) we realized that our drinks were about as good. They stop brewing decaf coffee after 12pm so we had to wait a little extra for a pour over decaf but we spent the time listening to music in my car. On accident at the speaker, the barista said `"just pull up and your drinks will be here`" and I accidentally said `"I can't wait to see you.`" It was a slip of the tongue and I was slightly embarrassed to pull up. But I'm over it now and drinking my drink from this great Starbucks.
Ste 100~5~Aug 3, 2015~This is my go to Starbucks.  I'm here all the time. Love the service and my drinks are always consistent. Sometimes it's busy and have to wait, or they forget that I don't want the whip cream on top, but I'm not one to get upset about it.
Ste 100~4~Jun 30, 2015~Starbucks is pretty much the McDonald's of coffee.  Not cheap but you know you will get the same thing the same way at every single location.  The coffee is good, I like the dessert element they make coffee into.  The food is ok and you can usually count on it being consistent and fresh.  The writing of your name on the cup in TOTALLY obtuse and weird phonetic fashion has got to be something they either train them for or look for that quality when they are hiring.  The staff is not ignorant and they are always pleasant and courteous.  I love the new Cool Refreshers to take to yoga!  Yum.  I also like the new app they have which makes the whole ordering, paying and tipping process cashless.  That makes it convenient and make a me more likely to search out a Starbucks.
Ste 100~3~May 6, 2011~The place lacks a bit of regular cleaning, both inside and outside. The cashiers has a tendency to do personal conversations during hours. Far for the best best Starbucks I have been to. Maybe service is better from the drive-thru?
Ste 100~4~Feb 27, 2014~A perfectly serviceable location with pleasant baristas and a short wait.  My cocoa and my husband's tea were great and made quickly.  In a shopping center full of odd things, it's a nice find.  It also has a drive-through and a few outside tables under a canopy (they face into a parking lot, so not that exciting).
Ste 100~5~Nov 7, 2011~I just love this Starbucks!  Brandie, Sondra, Krissy, Patty and  the whole gang are just the best!  They're are my extended family!
Ste 100~4~Jun 30, 2011~This is my go to location on the way to work. They are open super early and in the same direction that I'm travelling. I hate going out of my way.  The staff is very friendly and informative about their product offerings.
Ste 100~5~Aug 2, 2014~I come out of my way to go to this Starbucks. I've tried the location on Agua Fria and the location at Bell and 7th, but they all pale in comparison to this location! The employees are always friendly and kind and the wait never is long.
Ste 100~5~Aug 21, 2014~Fast drive thru &amp; friendly baristas.  Just wish they had a clover machine for the better iced coffees
Ste 100~1~Sep 27, 2019~bad service. dint do the coffe like i had ask. when i ask if they could fix it they just pore more into cup and made a mess of it. $6 coffee cant even clean the cup
Ste 100~5~Nov 30, 2009~No need to discuss the menu, we all have our favorite...such as a carmel frapp for me.  But I have to mention the service at this location.  Normally, I frequent the drive-thru.  They have never given me an incorrect order and they are super friendly.  Inside is very well maintained and the seating outside is nice.  I love my local starbucks!
Ste 100~4~Feb 22, 2012~The people are great. Always friendly, always smiling. There's a drive-through too, sometimes the line can be a bit long, especially early mornings between 730 and 830.
Ste 100~5~Mar 3, 2013~Great spot, lightning fast service. Good merch selection. Knowledgeable staff..
Ste 100~4~Sep 6, 2011~One of the better ones in town. Quick, friendly, consistent quality.
Ste 100~2~Oct 24, 2012~Irony at its finest. I pulled into the drive thru of this location knowing I would write a review, since everyone knows if you use their drive thru you have time to kill, and I was surprised by how quickly things moved today. The line was fully stacked to the end of the entrance and I managed to make it through to get my 2 drinks and a bagel all by the time I was done writing this review from my phone (about 7 minutes.....minus the extra minute + the girl in front of me took with feeling the need to socialize with an employee in the drive thru line....). Hopefully this is a sign that 20 minute drive through runs are a thing of the past an they will keep this up. For now, 2 stars....keep your butts in gear with less wait time and this location could certainly jump a few stars. Time will tell.
Ste 100~4~Aug 7, 2013~As with all your Starbucks, its coffee its hot and its a bit over priced but its better than fast food coffee. I just wish they had an express checkout for people who didn't want 20 items in their coffee.
Ste 100~4~Dec 31, 2014~Friendly and quick, my favorite Starbucks in Phoenix. In the same plaza as Jamba Juice too.
Ste 100~1~Sep 6, 2013~If it were only a review for the girl at the front, who got got my order perfect, we would give it a 5 star rating. However, the rating was diminished by 4 stars because of the incompetent man in the back. He got simple order incorrect 3 times. Upon finally getting it right, he forgot to put Carmel on the top as requested an payed for. After this he gave my sister iced tea, without shaking it, sweetening it, or putting it over ice. Really??
Ste 100~4~Nov 22, 2011~I love this Starbucks! It's as close to a neighborhood coffee place this part of Phoenix has. The staff there are always super friendly &amp; chit-chatty w/ me (which I adore) &amp; never had an issue w/ my orders. I tend to order different things a lot, &amp; so far so good. The Vanilla Scones are yummy, I must say.
Ste 100~5~Jul 24, 2013~Ham &amp; cheese croissant,  this is a new breakfast venture for me normally I stick with the delicious bacon gouda sandwich.
Ste 100~5~Apr 5, 2011~I love this starbucks! Very friendly people. They are the only one so far that gets my drink right everytime.
Ste 100~1~Dec 2, 2016~INCONSISTENT -   If my review was based solely on the friendliness of the staff - They'd get 5 stars. But unfortunately I do not go there for friendliness, I go there for coffee. And based on my coffee, they get 1 star. I order cream in my coffee. One day it has barely any cream and then the next day it has so much cream in it that it's undrinkable. I understand you want to be fast and get the drinks out as fast as possible - But slow the heck down and make a drink that's actually drinkable and not 90% cream to 10% coffee - Disgusting. They need to have a standard measurement of how much to add so it will always be the same drink that you got the day before.
Ste 100~3~Nov 25, 2016~While we LOVE Starbucks I'm only giving this location 3 stars. The kids steamers were WAY TOO HOT.  Had to take the lids off to let the milk cool down and wrap the outside of the cups in napkins.  Hard thing to do when there are more kids than adults in the car!
Ste 100~5~Dec 9, 2016~I come to this place frequently. Very convenient and its very close to me. The staff is always friendly inside or through the drive through. Only bad thing would be its a small place, and sometimes it can be busy and not much seating. Other than that is a comfortable and friendly environment.
Ste 100~2~Dec 10, 2014~Normally I have a great experience when I go to this Starbucks. What Im complaining about might seem a little petty, but its really just the principle. Starbucks will ask for your name and write it on the cup so they can call your name when its ready. Nice personal touch. Well when I ordered my drink I told her my name. I go by Aaron. Its my middle name. Well she starts to spell it Erin. The female spelling. I quickly saw what she was doing and corrected her. She continues to write the girls name, looks at me and shrugged her shoulders as if she didnt care. Her message of expressions to me were as, im to busy to spell it correctly and you need to deal with it. Well my message to you starbucks is there are plenty of places to spend 20 bucks on coffee and food everymorning. If you're going to try to act personal please teach your employees to at least pretend like they care. Even if they are busy and having a rough morning. I like happy people serving my coffee.
Ste 100~5~Jun 6, 2015~Favorite Starbucks to go to! They have tables out to relax, service is always friendly, never had a problem here and always get what i request in my drink like extra extra caramel! Even if this Starbucks is not the closest, this location will be number one. Very convenient with stores all around and entrance and drive thru exit are easy to enter and exit.
Ste 100~1~Oct 26, 2012~I'm not a Starbucks regular, but I was with friends who wanted to go here for breakfast. To be fair I've never once had a good experience at any Starbucks, and this was no exception. To me, Starbucks is always crowded, noisy, and has slow and rude service. Overall too stressful for me, if I want coffee I want a relaxing experience.On this trip, I ordered a breakfast sandwich, whichever one was featured in all the pictures on the menus. I asked for it to have turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. This totally confused the barista who for some reason thought I wanted two sandwiches. We got our stuff to go and getting outside was like a blessing as it was so much quieter outside.  I opened my package and found a completely different sandwich from what I ordered. My friends then explained that Starbucks doesn't customize sandwiches for customers and what I got was a sandwich called the turkey bacon. I have no clue why the barista couldn't have explained that to me instead of just giving me the wrong thing. there are no signs indicating this and as a non-regular I wouldn't have known. My friends couldn't explain it to me at the time of ordering because the store was so noisy and loud they would have had to scream at me. The sandwich I received was bland and I only ate a small part of it before throwing it out. The only other item I got was from the cold case, so they couldn't screw that up because I picked it myself. But yeah, apparently ordering one item is too difficult and they will screw it up.
Ste 100~5~Jun 26, 2015~I literally love this starbucks, i mean i love all of them in general, ive been a coffee drinker for years now and im only 28 but i crave the caramel frapss this location is close to my job so im never late, its kind of funny, but i tell my coworkers, no other starbucks makes my coffee like this one, yes its weird, but hey all have a different taste and this location makes it just perfect for me! Thanks!
Ste 100~2~Mar 16, 2015~My advice is: if you're in the area and you want a Starbucks, but you're in a rush, go to the one in Target, in the opposite parking lot to this one. You'll have to walk in the store, but at least you're sure to receive the right drink, and quickly.I've been to this Starbucks drive through many times, and I've had to go inside and exchange my order almost every one of them. There's nearly always a confusion at the speaker, even when I order a basic drink. I've ordered a tall macchiato and gotten a venti iced mocha, and other similar mistakes. (Even during uncrowded hours.) And, I have an allergy to ingredients common in many of Starbucks' drinks, so I am unable to just shrug and drink the mistake beverage. (Not to mention that these drinks are too pricey to settle for something you didn't want.) I have to go inside and try to simply explain to the employees that my drink is wrong and again tell them the one I need instead. It usually takes a while, because I have to wait for any people in front of me, and sometimes they've even messed up two or three times. Then my use of the drive through is defeated- the reason I go to the drive through is for a quick trip. I've been to many other Starbucks, all of which have no problem quickly and accurately making my order. The drinks themselves are made well, of course, but come on. Train your employees more thoroughly, fix your speaker, or do whatever you need to do to increase your accuracy. In the meantime, many erroneous visits have taught me a lesson. I will not be going to this location again.
Ste 100~4~May 24, 2013~I love coffee and i love Starbucks coffee and thisbstarbucks is next to my sons school and onvmy way home its always pretty fast and good
Ste 100~3~Nov 21, 2013~This Starbucks is right next to my work so I've gone there before sometimes! Don't go through the drive thru if you are in a hurry. Sat in line for ten mins with only two cars in front of me. This has happened multiple times. The employees are great, but I would suggest just parking and going in!
Ste 100~5~Jul 15, 2014~If you haven't tried star bucks , you're missing out . Great great quality drinks &amp; never fails to be the highlight of my day.
Ste 100~2~Nov 9, 2014~Have had my order messed up each time over the last 3 visits, employees don't seem to be working very hard.... Much better locations elsewhere.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jul 17, 2022~July 16th @6:16pm we visited Starbucks inside the target. I'd give it no stars if I could. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. There was a girl named Aj and she was helping us along with the other girl that I wish I could've gotten her name!! But she wasn't showing her name tag like the other employee. Figures. The girl hiding the name tag WAS SO INAPPROPRIATE. Hitting on a guy and blaming the blender on why we didn't get our NOT BLENDED drinks. STACY jumped in and could care less on what we had to say. Trying to protect her inappropriate employee. Never coming to this starbucks putting a bad name even on target so upsetting . I hope the others that were waiting as well got there money refunded!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Mar 28, 2021~Rude baristas! 4 times in a row I had a bad experience with 4 different baristas about their services:  - Charged more and did not give you a receipt unless you ask. I always order 1 type of drink and realized the difference in price. When I asked her why she could not explain herself and try to fill up my coffee cup with milk. - Did the wrong order and did not have attempt to make a new drink. - Mumbled to herself about customers loud enough to let them hear her (called them cheap). What kind of service is that? - Had attitude  I will not come back again! 4 times in a row is too much!I hope you - the manager of this Starbucks can read this feedback from me and will take some action.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Apr 9, 2021~I've been to this Starbucks a lot and loved it until these last several trips. I've asked for extra caramel and even paid extra for extra sauces and syrups and they didn't give them to me. This is the third time now.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Aug 22, 2019~Starbucks coffee tastes burned to me and I can not see where they get off charging that much for a cup of black burned coffee. I honestly would not even stop here if my grandkids didn't like their cake pops. Even the tea is terrible. Used to taste good. Maybe they burned it too
Frys-Phoenix #617~5~Jan 9, 2023~Tacoma and the other barista with jet black hair make the BEST coffee. I love that they are fast and always make my drink the way I want it.
Frys-Phoenix #617~1~Jun 30, 2024~Who ever works Sundays  afternoon shift seems miserable, rude not friendly at all. Have a attitude and don't even let you finish ordering your drinks. Why work at a place that you need customer service?
Frys-Phoenix #617~1~Apr 22, 2023~The worst experience I've ever had at a Starbucks in my life!!!! Not only was the drunk disgusting the girls that work there were awful. They flipped out because the drink was made wrong like it was my fault and it ended in a yelling fight, I can't believe they still have jobs with the way they treat customers.
Frys-Phoenix #617~3~Nov 16, 2018~Starbucks is my wife's favorite and I don't think anything is left in their menu which we didn't tried. All thanks to my wife to get us starbucks gold membership. Their coffee taste good without any second thought but the price they charge for them is not justifiable. For taste 5/5 but seeing value for money 3/5.
Frys-Phoenix #617~5~Apr 22, 2023~I had the best experience with this location. I was having a bad day and didn't realize anyone could notice however Alexis, gisselle, and Jannette not only made sure I was entirely satisfied but lifted me up with their positive energy.  All baristas introduced themselves to me and made sure I was satisfied with my order. Also I could taste the coffee instead of just straight milk from other locations I have visited. I highly recommend!
Frys-Phoenix #617~5~Jan 6, 2023~Great location and workers. Coffee and drinks are delicious and line moves quickly. I don't why such low reviews.
Frys-Phoenix #617~3~Nov 5, 2021~I  just ordered the pink drink and they barley put any of the strawberry drink in it! literally all I taste is watered down coconut milk with strawberries in it. Hope they don't do this again if I come back. Come on Starbucks.
Frys-Phoenix #617~1~Jul 28, 2021~I will never go to this location again!! Even if it's close to me. The snobby girls that work in the morning are something else, never experienced such rudeness at Starbucks. Not to mention they can't take orders correctly or make a decent 3 item coffee. I'll drive future from now on.
Frys-Phoenix #617~4~Jul 17, 2015~Shopping and StarbucksI have to admit I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks store inside of Frys. This location is one of my favorite. The service is great and the staff are very friendly.  This location is clean and feels comfortable. I can do my shopping and enjoy a latte at the same time.My coffee is always made the way I order and tastes great. In addition, to great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack.Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.
Frys-Phoenix #617~5~Nov 27, 2013~Finally a Starbucks on my way to work. It's inside Frys Marketplace.  Nothing really to say other than it's new and clean and it's Starbucks.
Frys-Phoenix #617~2~Jul 1, 2018~This Starbucks is usually pretty decent, but today, I happened to get a couple of rude workers. The Starbucks location closes at 8:00pm, but I roll in at around 7:50 and the girl looks at me, looks back at her male co-worker and says they're closed. The hours online states that their hours are from 5am-8pm, not 5am-7:50pm. Disappointing!
Frys-Phoenix #617~1~Nov 17, 2017~Worst service I have ever received at a Starbucks. I tried to use my gift card and apparently it couldn't scan and he didn't know how to get the money any other way. That was fine, but then I got in my creme brulee frappe and it was made incorrectly. I also ordered a cheese danish which was hard and stale. The barista's didn't seem like they were interested in making things right, but they did remake my drink and it was very good. I will likely never return to this location even though I pass by often.
Frys-Phoenix #617~4~Aug 6, 2015~They are ALWAYS friendly to me here. I see them interacting pleasantly with other customers as well. This crew works hard. My drink is correct and usually made in a timely manner. It's not their fault that everyone orders Frappuccinos and overly complicated espresso beverages. It's still new looking, spacious, and clean. I love that they are open pretty late for an in-store Starbucks. Nothing like grabbing a refreshing iced tea, doing your shopping, and getting a refill on the way out. So thankful for this store!
Frys-Phoenix #617~1~May 12, 2017~The barista was very rude... and didn't have a name tag... he kept asking WHAT?! Instead of politely asking again for your order... then when he was about to put the drizzle I asked if he could do caramel INSTEAD of chocolate... and he rudely claim he has to charge extra... when the price is the same on both items... guy is extremely slow it took about 20mins to get my drink... and my drink was very watery...
Frys-Phoenix #617~2~Dec 25, 2015~This is one of the slowest Starbucks ever.  The drive through is always 10 cars deep and takes about thirty minutes to get coffee. Very limited parking in front of the place also.
Frys-Phoenix #617~3~Aug 16, 2017~Jordan was pretty rude before I even received my coffee, after receiving my two coffees we immediately noticed they didn't taste as usual. We are regular here and other locations and usually receive great service. Kyle at this location is the MVP he is usually here when we come in and provides exceptional service. I'm glad he was there when we brought the drinks to Jordan's attention because he made them correctly! Although I was disappointed when I brought the drinks up and said they didn't taste quite right and Jordan just looked to Kyle and rudely said `"idk you make them`".
Frys-Phoenix #617~3~Sep 7, 2014~Inside a fry's. Nice and clean. Rather new. Nice seating area to enjoy the Wi-fi. Starbucks is Starbucks. Nothing extraordinary to type about.
Safeway~1~Nov 29, 2023~The lady was coughing sneezing and had a mask on... I asked her if she had a cold and she said yes‍ I know it's the holiday season but please stay home next time so you don't get other people and there families sick. She literally had her hand all over the cups, lids etc. throwing these away and headed to a different Starbucks.
Safeway~3~May 25, 2022~Tried the new chocolate cream cold brew drink. It needed a bit more chocolate flavor, but the cream foam and coffee drink were refreshing. The idea tea and lemonade was also refreshing.
Safeway~1~May 14, 2019~I placed an online order for two unsweetened green teas and a hot mocha. It is suppose to be super fast. I pulled up and there were two cars in front of me. The Starbucks employee had me wait at the ordering screen. When they came back to take my order, I told them I was there to pick up my online order. They told me to pull up. I did and was handed the two green teas. I was told one more was coming... Then the drive through worker disappeared. Two other workers were inside.. neither came to see what I was missing. They kept looking in my direction but did not come over. They were talking about their tips and were even taking the money out of their envelopes. Then they disappeared as well. I was ready to get out of my car and make the mocha myself. After about 5 minutes the first employee finally came back and handed me the mocha THAT HAD BEEN SITTING AT THE PICK-UP COUNTER INSIDE THE STORE THE WHOLE TIME! I worked at a Starbucks for over a year. First of all, we never left a customer at the window unless we were short staffed and had to both make the drink and take orders and money. Two, you don't touch money and such unless you are not handling drinks and food. Money is dirty and they are making people's drinks. This violates health code. I was very disappointed in the customer service and lack of professionalism at this location.
Safeway~4~May 12, 2014~I don't understand why it's necessary to have 2 Starbucks coffees directly across the street from each other. UNTIL I went to the drive thru on 7th right next to my apartment and they had RUN OUT OF COFFEE. How is this possible? It's an effing coffee shop. Anyways, I came to this place and they saved the day! It's not as clean as the other place on 7th, but they are a bit faster at making drinks.
Safeway~1~May 4, 2015~Bad service, bad frap, bad attitude. Sat right behind the window. Worker insisted I get out of my chair and walk around to pick up my drink. Couldn't use common sense to simply hand it to me since its in arm reaching distance. Work on common sense service.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Jan 18, 2024~there food is good the service is good and the ambiance is pretty chill. 4 stars  i do reccomend
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Nov 24, 2024~The employees were extremely rude and disrespectful, no reason for them to be acting like that. Also I had to wait almost 20 minutes for one drink and there's no other customers here... I had to ask them TWICE to please just make my drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Feb 23, 2023~Will do in a pinch  The service at Starbucks is really pretty quick even though the lines are long.   This is not my normal Starbucks, however my coffee was made exactly the way I ordered and taste good.in addition to coffee Starbucks offers delicious pastries and sandwiches  if you are craving  a quick snack. I usually grab a cake pop or 2 on the go for my nephewcand my self. Not my usual Starbucks but will do in a pinch.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Jul 31, 2023~One of the things I like about Starbucks is that they sell one of my favorite brands of cold pressed juice: Evolution Fresh. I got an Evo drink and a bacon gouda sandwich (which they make fresh) for $10.53. The food was pretty good. Unfortunately, the Evo juice is overpriced. They only have the 11 oz bottles which they sell for $5 but you can easily buy a 15oz for around $4 instead. I guess you're paying more for the Starbucks atmosphere. The service itself was nothing special.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jul 17, 2024~Drinks and food looked ok, stood in line for 10 minutes while they took drive thru orders before me.  Workers showed anger towards me for just coming up to ask if my drink been called up yet.  I asked  one of them why are you all so angry because I'm getting my drink?  They said because we were over loaded on making orders.  I get it but don't take it out on customers who do have patience and not complaining.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Dec 9, 2023~I ordered a Grande Hot White Chocolate and it was filled a little over half the cup. What the actual fuck Starbucks. This used to be my favorite spot but lately, this location has been slacking.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jul 5, 2022~Starbucks if my life line. When I'm not sitting in the drive thru getting a handcrafted drink, I'm at home brewing it for myself. Today I came to a different location because they had a cold tumbler I was looking for. Got nervous for a min because they couldn't find it, but they did! And, I'm in love. I love starbucks and they have great merch. The cups keep your drinks hot or cold depending on your preference. I got the matte stainless steel cup and love it. Today, I decided to try a toasted vanilla oatmilk shaken Espresso and boyyy was it good! I got one less pump because I don't like it too sweet and it was perfect.  The toasty almond flavor is just perfect and pairs great with oatmilk. I'm lactose intolerant and I'm so glad that starbucks has more than just soy!The staff was friendly and helpful finding my cup!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Dec 29, 2021~Starbucks with a great staff that's fast, courteous and friendly. Derek, Kip and other staff are top ten in Phoenix. The location is very convenient at 19th Ave and Thunderbird.The hours are also longer(closes at 9pm)than most Starbucks in the area.Top ten Phoenix Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 9, 2024~Sooo, first I'm walking up to the door and the girl working locks it in front of me. I then get back in a 30k vehicle to go thru the drive thru -only for thee biggest franchise on the planet to tell me they couldn't give me change for a $20 bill?! Yeah, it's 6:30pm on a Friday night! Male and female working 2/9/24 -what a freakin joke! Horrible horrible serivice!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Dec 19, 2023~Doors are locked at 4:23pm on a Tuesday. This is the second time they have had locked doors during supposed business hours with no notice or sign.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Sep 11, 2023~Once again I decide to give this place another try since it's very close to my home.  And once again I was disappointed.   I ordered egg bites and a coffee drink.  The egg bites were good but the coffee had a horrible burnt plastic taste which seems to be the norm here.  For a place that supposedly specializes in coffee they definitely have dropped the ball.   Coffee is undrinkable and will be going straight into the trash.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Mar 24, 2023~The past three times I picked up coffee here it has been burnt and does not taste good.  And then this morning I tried again and my coffee was not only burnt but had a burnt plastic taste to it as well.  Undrinkable!!  The employees do not care about the quality of the product they put out.  Do better Starbucks!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Aug 15, 2023~This is the 2nd time I try to go inside the store to pick up my order and it's closed...Not sure why they are closing the inside at 7pm when they are supposed to be open until 9pm.  Ridiculous
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Oct 2, 2023~Great location on the way to major highway and by a high school which may be a problem during the school year? No line at 7:45 in the morning which was odd but this location is quick! Oatmeal was dry but I just added a little milk. Coffee was made perfectly.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Jul 25, 2023~Great location on the way to major highway and by a high school which may be a problem during the school year? No line at 7:45 in the morning which was odd but this location is quick! Oatmeal was dry but I just added a little milk. Coffee was made perfectly.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Jun 21, 2023~Short on time so drove through here for a quick bite.  It would have been nice if they weren't out of the first 3 items I tried to order.  Honestly...stock up people.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~May 21, 2021~Starbucks is what you expect.This place had full staff but all the outside tables were filthy while staff was just talking inside.Not the best location as transients come and sit around and leave there trash outside,maybe that's why they really don't want to go outside and clean...oh well what do you do?
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jan 13, 2024~When I received my order, I was disappointed. I ordered a cinnamon caramel cream cold brew. When It was delivered, I was sad to find out that my drink was made incorrectly. My drink included of only cold brew. My receipt states the order that I paid for but on the drink it says that I didn't order any cold foam. I was refunded a small portion of what I paid. I believe I should receive a full refund given that I did not receive the drink that I paid for.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 11, 2023~Workers dancing behind counter instead of helping customers. Had them remake my coffee 3 times because their `"coffee was watery and they didnt know why.`"Unbelievable
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Oct 18, 2022~I am done with Starbucks.  It used to be amazing and now it's bitter and half foam.  I ordered a venti cappuccino and it would have blown away in the wind if there was one, it was so light.  The brew was so bitter and hard to find since the foam made up at least half of the contents of the cup!  I used the drive thru window and was served in a sufficient amount of time by an adequate server so I'm not criticizing the employees.  It's the product that is unacceptable.    The product was not worth it at all.  I don't mind spending  more on a quality coffee served by friendly employees but spending 'over the top' money on bitter coffee in a half full container is just wrong.  Bye Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Oct 28, 2020~Great Starbucks with a great staff. They are doing a great job social distancing. Only a few people here, all hanging outside even though the inside is open. A tall hazelnut coffee was the perfect cup of coffee on a cold 70 degree day. Docking a star because they didn't have `"sugar free`" hazelnut.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 30, 2023~I put an order on the mobile app and selected in store pickup. When I got there the store was, once again, arbitrarily closed, with a sign that you had to use the drive thru. The drive thru was packed and I did not have time to sit in the line, so I had to leave without my coffee. I have called five times in the past ten minutes to cancel the order and request a refund, but no one will answer, so I guess I'm just out $8. Ridiculous. If you randomly close the store, you need to turn off in-store pickup, and you need to have phone lines open so people can cancel if they don't have time to sit in the drive thru line. That's the whole reason I order in the app in the first place.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Mar 7, 2023~For no reason the inside seating is closed, making it inconvenient for me to order, and instead having to order within the app when I don't want to. Other wise the food is good.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 24, 2023~Didn't even end up getting our drinks, just decided to drive right through. Whatever person they had working feb 24, 2023 at 8pm was nothing but rude, sarcastic, and just all around irritating when i was extremely nice and understanding. don't tell me you can't do something when the store i work at does it and so does every other store i've gone to. you're just being lazy and thought you were funny when you made your smart comment. disappointing
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~May 17, 2019~Convenient location. Ok service. Needs a good cleaning inside and out! With the abundance of high school kids here they really need to be diligent. Outside trash everywhere. Tables need cleaning. Inside I noticed the glass surrounding the counter was dirty and they hadn't swept in awhile.Last time I was in I asked them to come clean the outside. They responded they would but never did. Windows are dirty. I've been here several times and it never seems to get better.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Mar 3, 2022~I'm just sort of sick of Starbucks. Why can't they have more drinks on the menu that don't have gobs of caffeine in them but isnt herbal tea? (Snore) Are they trying to create drug addictions? But i digress....I like the pink drink but it has even more caffeine in it than coffee does. So in the middle of the day if you want to sleep that night, you have to drink tea or some fattening heart attack crap if you want to get a nice drink to chill.  Stupid. And honestly I think the coffee is pretty bitter even if I get the blonde roast.  I know they are a coffee shop but they have expanded themselves well beyond coffee. I'm just surprised they have not come up with more and better and original drinks by now that don't have tons of calories or gobs of caffeine that isn't tea.  And the food looks fake and overly processed.  But any teenager I've ever offered to buy food for there, suddenly gets these wide bugged out excited eyes. So there must be something in the food that attracts teenagers. Starbucks is old news. They don't even treat people well anymore. And for a 5 dollar coffee, I wouldn't mind a little fun design on the top of my cappuccino like other coffee shops do. When they first opened up-amazing. Now,  I think they are on their way out or at least down, unless they can get each younger generation hooked on caffeine and plastic food. Their stock price also shows they aren't rocking it anymore. The only time it really goes up is the pumpkin spice latte release each year. Talk about GROSS sugar overload. Ugh. I wish they would do something different. I'm tired sooooo of Starbucks. Meh.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~May 18, 2023~I think it is so weird that they ask for tips through the drive-through! I am not a cheap person I am very generous with waitresses bartenders I tip my nail people, my hair people, etc. but the audacity to hound me for a tip when I've been waiting in the drive-through for 20 minutes is ridiculous. This review is not for the employees. This is for the company starbucks the billion dollar company that instead of paying their employees more they hound their customers for tips through the drive-through. That's crazy to me. I am paying cash from now on because it's so awkward !!! I have $10 to pay for my coffee &amp; sandwich in the morning. I wish I had more but I don't. I'm sorry! Starbucks should be paying you guys more truly there so greedy it's not even funny! I'm gonna buy an espresso machine. I would understand if this was a mom and pops coffee shop but it's not. It's a billion $ worldwide company come on Starbucks do better and this is not for the employees. This is for the company.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Apr 27, 2022~The girl at the drive-thru window right now was so unbelievably rude!!!!! I never had an experience like that at Starbucks lol another girl had to take her place! She was so mean like!!! I can't believe with my 7 dollar coffee I got a side of bitter attitude and misery! It's not my fault if you work here and you're mad AF don't blame me blame the Billion dollar CEOs at Starbucks! I mean there's one on every corner I'll go to another one but seriously check your attitude! I was very cordial because I could've been a B back!!! I could've said something hilarious but I didn't i just got my expensive coffee and went about my business !!!!!!!!! The craziest part is I never had that experience at that Starbucks everybody's usually very nice not this girl tho!!!! Take your bitterness to Dunkin' Donuts.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jul 9, 2021~Great place, great workers. Macy works there and is great.Got my Strawberry Lemonade Smoothie.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Apr 30, 2023~They recently removed all outdoor furniture from their patio without notice. Jokes on us because we thought it would be fun to walk our dog here on a weekend morning to spend some quality time outside but we're told by an employee that they had `"got rid of it`". Kind of a bummer
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jan 6, 2021~`"This Starbucks is amazing I get the best customer satisfaction`" said nobody at this establishment.Every time I get to order from here I usually get my Frappuccino and always come across rude workers with attitude and today I got a feisty one.. I wanted the manager to talk to about the rudeness from the employer but turns out she was the manager.. I mean now that I realize why the other workers have an attitude is because `"Manager`" gives off, Shade and the workers think it's okay to rude too.. I mean set an example for not only yourself but for the workers that look up too you..  I was refused service, told her I ordered the Frappuccino minus the attitude and kindly told `"Sam`" the manager to change her attitude and I wasn't done ordering also but it was a scenic detour around the building to get nothing but attitude although that was the only the I didn't have to pay for..Come to this building for a nice detour and a nice fresh attitude from the manager and the workers.. ask for a free sample of sass and definitely they'll deliver, Guaranteed!! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Oct 11, 2019~I got the peeeerrrfect drink from this location! They were so polite! I ordered a drink from the Starbucks `" secret menu `" and they were so polite. She even asked me which straw I prefer in my beverage. Baristas like the ones at Starbucks make your day just a little sweeter. i came into the store to order the dragon drink and on the menu it says comes with coconut milk. She's asks if i want lemonade with that.... i was confused because I've never been asked that. I get a drink that has noooooo coconut milk and she tells me oh that's the violet drink ... i said there's no `" violet drink `" on your menu she insisted i and the menu were incorrect. My mom ordered ice tea with a spare tea bag when getting the receipt and waiting for drinks she was charged a whole 5 dollar beverage instead of 20 cents for a tea bag.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 25, 2019~Starbucks...Didnt you all just shut down for a day of cultural sensitivity training. This location should consider making sure the redhead employee that happens to be training the new woman Bree (that works the register) for success and not failure. Bree was assisting each customer in the manner I believe starbucks wants, she was always doing her best to offer great service to each customer... meanwhile the read head with the tattoos other arm, and tattered black tshirt leaned over the coffee machines and register for the togo window just laughing and chatting with another employee who was supposed to be making drinks that Bree was ringing in...I believe her name is Adele.  After about 20 min passing and watching this multiple times, I went to the pick up window and she walked by me ignoring me. I then waited in line again while brie did her best to help every customer, while the red head and another employee just chatted...once bree was able to assist me I let her know i hadn't received my drink, she told the redhead head and she proceeded to figure out what I ordered.. about 10 min later she provided me with something, lol. and proceeded back to talking. shortly after a tall gentleman in a yellow shirt went to the pick up counter to remind the staff he was also forgotten. This staff needs management or management training but the lack their of is a CANCER to your location.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jul 23, 2017~I got the peeeerrrfect drink from this location! They were so polite! I ordered a drink from the Starbucks `" secret menu `" and they were so polite. She even asked me which straw I prefer in my beverage. Baristas like the ones at Starbucks make your day just a little sweeter.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Sep 2, 2017~I stopped by the location yesterday and it was so chill. The employee had my mobile order ready and didn't have a problem with me adding a last minute item to my order (mmmm pumpkin loaf). I found out that they do a `"Customer of the Month`" event there and I thought that was a cool way to thank your customers for their loyalty. Also, very cool that when I got my treat, they had actually drawn some art on my treat bag. A little bee and it said `"Bee Happy.`" Two thumbs up for this location!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Feb 4, 2021~Nice Starbucks. Very clean inside and one hundred percent covid-19 safety compliant.bathrooms were open and clean. Service was fast and friendly. Coffee tasted good. Nice small outdoor dining area with overhead awnings to block the sun.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Nov 11, 2022~This Starbucks is literally across the street from me. What a Convenience! NOT!! The employees here are so very rude. I spend too much money with Starbucks to be treated so terribly. I wish I knew the early morning barista name, she's the problem. So now I have to drive to a further location just to get coffee because this location can't get together. And the coffee is horrible on top of it.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Oct 23, 2022~Had a distasteful experience this morning of October 23rd around 9am. Went into pick up order and they claimed they didn't have it. And told me to wait 5 minutes. So I did. Only after ten minutes finding out they didn't even start the order. The supervisor had an attitude and told me to wait another ten minutes. I had to leave before we started arguing. She was very disrespectful and seemed as she didn't want to be there. Seemed lazy with a bad attitude. Didn't appreciate it and I recommended peopoe not go ti this location. Managers I doubt will do anything as the time we're in that type of behavior is ok
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 6, 2023~Didn't like an interaction I had with an employee. All I asked was a question about a type of coffee and it's correlation to the stars points system so I can take advantage of them properly as I was trying to save a buck getting my coffee before school. Then James at the drive thru said he didn't know what I was talking about. I understood but still felt like I had to rush to pick a random menu item so I just got water since I wanted to move out of everyone's way and just decided to direct my question to a manager or supervisor if at all possible. As I got to the window, James said there wasn't a manager nor supervisor available because they were between them right now. I asked a bit just in question because all I wanted to know was a simple coffee type. I felt like he was just giving me attitude and wasn't being helpful at all. He could've asked his employees if they knew or something.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jun 4, 2022~I understand that people are doing their best during Covid but every time I come to this Starbucks my drink literally taste like they haven't cleaned the espresso machine. And every other drink I purchased it is just not up to Starbucks standards. I literally live down the street from the Starbucks and I drive all the way to Bell to go to Starbucks because this one is so disgusting. I've given this Starbucks chance after chance to just improve and every time it's a big fail like I think I've had to return my drink three or four times!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Sep 14, 2021~Had a mobile order for my mom, I got the drink and don't know why the lady asked me to tell her what the other item was when they have the mobile order and all the items she order, it was as if she was testing me. Come her often, the Long lines usually take forever, usually are always out of something.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Sep 11, 2022~I usually don't have a problem with this Starbucks, I would rate it a 5 usually but this morning I came and Tonya took my order she was very rude. One of my drinks was made wrong and I politely told her she said nothing and was super impolite.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Nov 7, 2021~Let me get something straight, In-N-Out has done more in 48 months than Starbucks has done in 48 years! This dang place has super over priced drinks and they aren't even good! It is all just sugar!! Let's go Brandon!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~Apr 9, 2021~Service is usually pretty good but they are always out of breakfast burritos it's off a busy road so it's hard to study or do work outside. If you like to people watch then that's the spot.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Nov 21, 2017~I would give this Starbucks 10 stars if I could! Ordered from mobile app today and it defaulted to the new 7th &amp; TBird location (completely my fault  ) So my poor BF who is picking it up, is now standing in there very confused. I called and spoke with Dani, she was so incredibly helpful and understanding, not only did she get my order ready right away, she explained this situation happens often,which made me feel much less dumb  This is the greatest Starbucks I've ever been to, the employees are always thoughtful and friendly, the building is clean and charming and my drink is perfect every time!!! This location deserves some recoginition for sure
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Dec 3, 2019~I regret coming here every time I do. It's the one closet to my house so it's where I have ended up while I was sick this past week. The people that work here are beyond rude. The last time I came in the guy sat my drinks next to the window and continued to make the cars that were behind me their drinks. Didn't even take my payment. I was about to drive off when he finally opened the window. Didn't say hi or even the amount I owed. Just scanned my phone and handed my drinks over. This isn't the first time.  My husband got a hot chocolate from there the other day and a it wasn't filled to the top. I get that there was whipped cream on the top but a good two inches of whipped cream that melted into the drink before he even got to it? Really? Don't waste your time or money at this location. The people at 7th st and thunderbird are MUCH nicer.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 18, 2020~Tonight went to Starbucks and had asked for 2 separate orders at 8:18pm and had to repeat my order 4 times and the lady at drive thru was giving attitude the whole time and had repeated my order over and over and every single time it was not correct then when she got it correct we went to the window and still didn't have it correct and had got attitude that we had said something and had the person that was paying for the second order pay for one of my drinks and didn't want to change it for me to pay! I never had to deal with someone so rude and disrespectful at Starbucks ever and this is my first time ever going to this Starbucks and will not be coming back to this Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jun 30, 2018~Worst Starbucks. They never get my order right and take too long to get any orders ready.  I went and try to get my order right they never gave me my order right, they just gave me a free drink. I never going back to this place.   I ask for 2 caramel with extra coffee, not  2 caramel with frapp Chips.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Apr 21, 2019~Worst Starbucks experience I've ever had. I made a mobile order so that I could get my coffee and bagel quicker before work. I stood in this Starbucks for 17 min waiting before deciding to ask about my order. Everyone was ignoring me where as if I go into any other Starbucks they typically greet you and ask if you needed something if you've been standing there for a while. I asked the lady taking orders if she's seen my mobile order because it had been almost 20 minutes. She went and checked and they had made my drink wrong but no bagel yet. So they finally made the bagel and remade the drink. The drink was still wrong and the girl just tossed the bagels my direction. No kind words or customer service. Disappointed and now am late for work. Probably won't go to this location ever again because 4-8 minutes of waiting turned into 25.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Dec 23, 2019~Faith is an amazing worker.  She was quick to help me out when I was in a rush and was so nice! She makes my day better.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Sep 24, 2019~The workers are very nice and it is overall awesome, it gets crowded at 3:30 when the kids from the high school nearby get out, but it clears out in about 30ish minutes
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Oct 19, 2015~PREDICTION: won't be there long- I've been inside twice in 3 weeks-FILTHY!!If you're a drive thru person I guess you're ok, seems like that's the only focus. Met a friend inside on 2 occasions, we ordered the flavored soda- about 4-5 customers after us got their hot beverages well before we got anything, both times. And both times we were asked what we were still waiting for. Um, yeah...those $5 sodas?? Oh! We'll get right to that. At least 6 ppl behind counter during each hour long visit- nobody seems to care that the tables and chairs are all askew, filthy- all kinds of wrappers and trash on the floor. There were 3 separate customers who were all alone, taking up the `"4-top`" tables w/laptops, leaving us the only halfway clean high top table in the corner-beside a trash can -- we asked for something to clean it off &amp; were told that the `"napkins were by the door`"-also telling them that all of the tables were dirty &amp; sticky. But why would they come out from behind the counter to check the front of house when in all of the time we were there they didn't wipe the 'pick-up' counter??? It was freaking gross, and to neglect it even after being told, are you kidding me?? I saw one employee go on break, walked to door and back- didn't bother to take any kind of ownership by straightening the chairs, taking a look around to check cleanliness...this Starbucks is in my neighborhood, I was hoping that it would be good to get that kind of biz to help build the area a bit- I'm not so hopeful anymore. I gave this place 2 tries. My friend came from Glendale and she's told me that she'll never go to this location again because of what I said in this review. Very sad. I don't know who trains the staff, clearly there was no focus on the comfort or concern of the inside patrons. There should be a sign posted that a 4-top cannot be occupied by a single person too-especially when there are a few ppl taking up that space singly. (No place to put handbag on those tiny high top tables, the area is still kind of dicey, no chance you could safely place your handbag on the chairback out of your sight) SHAPE-UP, STARBUCKS, or like the many failed businesses in that space before you, you will FAIL!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Feb 16, 2020~Walk in to this place today. I had a slight limp because of blisters. The floor was soft but no one asked me how I was hurt. I ordered an identical ice coffee as my friend who had an invisible sling on his arm. Not sure how he felt emotionally but I was sad. I became happy when after 6 minutes both our drinks came out at the same time. I felt really nice but he must have felt like some fucking idiotic slab of shit.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Apr 24, 2016~Coffee great!Staff great!Atmosphere great!Cleanliness??? Overall seems ok, but the floors - especially ladies room - the WORST I've actually ever seen! Looked like a pack of wolves came through and bedded there for the night! Took a better look at floor in seating area and they looked pretty dirty as well.Come on, Starbucks! This is am eating/drinking establishment, and now I see I'm not the first review on Yelp to mention this problem!My advice; stay in your clean car, use the drive through, and wait till you get to work to use a bathroom! Can only imagine what the men's might look like?! Ugh!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Mar 30, 2019~Super nice and clean. Plenty of parking. I sure like those new cloud macchiatos. Just wish it wasn't $6 a day for coffee :/
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jan 24, 2018~come here like 4 times a month to get either my green tea soy latte with 4 pumps classic or my green tea frappe with caramel drizzle and java chips or passion tea lemonade with 8 pumps classic and a splash of apple juice and they are always happy and friendly in the drive thru and fast service
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Apr 29, 2018~This Starbucks has some consistently nice people and consistently good service.  After having to move during spring break and not having internet-They saved my semester!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Sep 16, 2020~Horrible. Half of the time when you come to this location they aren't open despite it being early in the afternoon. When they are open, expect to wait in line for at least 20 minutes.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 30, 2017~This location is very inconsistent. They've been unfriendly, slow, and mess my order up far too often.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Feb 5, 2020~You know, I live by this Starbucks and come quite often out of convenience. I constantly defend it to my mom who abhors it. However, I'm over it. I'm over the rude baristas, I'm over the drinks CONSTANTLY being wrong or 75% ice.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Nov 3, 2016~I always go to this Starbucks and they always make my drinks perfect. Sometimes, i go here to study and they are accommodating and generous. Love the mobile app!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jun 4, 2016~Dani is awesome at this location kisses to her She rocks !! I will appreciate her! There is no one like her!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jan 16, 2016~Love this location when I come from Cali it's down the street to where I stay!the crew is awesome here!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Mar 17, 2017~Whenever, I came to the drive-thru at this location, Sarah is always very friendly.  She listens to how I wound like my drink is cause I have some food allergies and she is excellent with her customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Nov 23, 2019~I'm tired of paying money everyday to always have something wrong with my drink. For god sakes can't people read. And most of them need to go back for training on how to make an iced caramel macchiato. Very frustrating.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Sep 23, 2016~Probably the worst and slowest Starbucks I've ever been to. They should take some tips from Dutch bros. on how quality and speedy service looks like. Manbun guy was slow and didn't complete my order.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~3~May 2, 2017~I usually don't want to say bad things about a company but this Starbucks location irritates me. I spend a pretty decent amount of money on Starbucks a week. I go to this location cause it's close to home and the staff is amazing. However they consistently get my very basic drink wrong. Either the size is incorrect or it's not shaken like their menu suggests when ordering tea. It may not seem like it matters but being a person that orders two to three green teas daily I can tell you it does effect the taste. I really hope they stop cutting corners for the sake of being faster and make the drinks the way they are suppose to be.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Aug 18, 2019~Worts Starbucks from Az  i bet the girl at the window was having a really bad day, she was rude and had an angry look.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Nov 22, 2019~Wow, I love Starbucks.. but who didn't know that! So I have been going a lot more lately and it always nice being welcomed in with a cheery smile, and a warm hello!! And what's ever better is the new man who works there (Jordan) was really helpful yesterday explaining to me how I can redeem my star points!! So that was extremely appreciated
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Jan 8, 2016~Starbucks is starbucks...employees are friendly and my coffee was good. I always order the Peppermint Mocha when it's in season. The drive-thru is pretty quick. Overall good service every time I go.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~May 31, 2019~I'm from out of town so this was my very first time but they were all WONDERFUL. Jordan, Lena, etc were so wonderful and sweet and funny and the service was perfect. I had to wait a little bit for my sandwich but that was like, not even a big thing. Their customer service is great and I'm sad I'm leaving soon because I'd be in here all the time.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Mar 1, 2018~Thank you Starbucks!?!? Not only did you make my daughter late for school, you also made me late for a doctors appt! Once a week we go there as a treat and today was no treat.  After waiting 20 minutes in the lobby and watching the drive thru cycle through several times, (I went inside so I wasn't one of those idling cars) I asked how much longer for my mocha frap and a white chocolate mocha.  Your response was the same as McDonald's with their milkshakes.  `"Sorry the machine was broken`" and just then one of you pulled a sticker for my drink and asked me what it was, well at that time I couldn't wait, so I said just give me a regular cup of coffee and I'll split the difference with your review, so here we are, debt paid, and now I need to look for a new place to treat ourselves once a week!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~2~Nov 16, 2016~11/16 Wednesday night at 6:55pm. Workers are not very friendly. Wifi is horrible and the response I got from the barista was `"we are by a mountain, so it's gonna be slow`" she did not care at all. In fact, she answered me and then walked away as if I wasn't worth her time. Mind you, I had to wait for her to finish talking to her friend at the long table near the register before she would answer my question. The wifi won't even allow me to upload a document to my drop box, that's how horrible it is. Clearly customer service isn't valued at this Starbucks. Very disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Oct 18, 2015~This one's brand new and I've only experienced the drive thru but that was pretty much the best part. It was like a video conference when I was ordering which took me by surprise! But it was outstanding service and the building looks solid. I will have to go inside next time.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jul 20, 2016~Always has great customer service and I haven't had any problems with my orders at this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Jul 16, 2016~Nice Starbucks. Nice staff. Not a lot of hipsters. I really hate writing these stupid reviews. Are we done yet????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? God help me.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jan 30, 2019~First time visiting this location and I was very impressed by the staff and the outstanding customer service we received! My mom and I are Starbucks fans we love to try new drinks but today we wanted something nice and hot due to the cold weather outside. Vanessa was extremely sweet helping us out with ordering the right cup of coffee for my mom. And my peppermint white mocha was excellent! The store was under a rush yet both Vanessa  and John were extremely professional, nice and always with a smile on their faces! Not only with my mom and I but all the customers. Thank you guys for everything ! Oh almost forgot and the spelling to my name was correct ! Made it even better !!!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jun 26, 2016~I love this Starbucks. I usually do drive through on my way to class or work and they sure are fast, friendly and efficient.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Feb 7, 2018~I never thought that I would care enough to leave a review for such a big chain like Starbucks. But I come from Seattle and I have never received such excellent quality and personable service in my life! The employees here always so cheerful, helpful and energetic. I have never been to Starbucks with baristas that are ON THEIR A GAME, quite like this team. I've only been here twice since I moved in down the street, and it pains me that I can't remember the two names of the people who brought me to write this review. But I certainly hope to see them again soon. Way to go!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jul 30, 2016~Slowest Starbucks drive thru I have EVER been in. And I've been in ones that are far busier. This one is extremely slow; doesn't matter how many cars are in it.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Apr 26, 2016~Baristas are good at making drinks and remembering the regulars! They try to make everyone's experience pleasant and connect with every customer. Busy in the mornings before work and when the high school lets out! Spacious lobby and patio for hanging out. Large table for groups or meetings. Special clover machine (reverse French press) for delicious fresh cups of coffee made to order! Large selection of small-lot reserve coffee. Free coffee tastings every Thursday!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~4~Apr 17, 2016~Baristas are good at making drinks and remembering the regulars! They try to make everyone's experience pleasant and connect with every customer. Busy in the mornings before work and when the high school lets out! Spacious lobby that is cute and clean. Large outdoor patio with misters during the heat for hanging out. Special clover machine for delicious fresh cups of coffee! Free coffee tastings every Thursday!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~May 13, 2016~This has nothing to do with the coffee (it's okay) and everything to do with the HORRIBLE parking lot and drive through!  I stopped at the drive through at 7:20 and didn't manage to get out of the parking lot until 7:45.  Needless to say, I was within minutes of being late to usher my students into the classroom and getting a ding on my review - all for a cup of coffee!  I literally could not get out of the parking lot because by then the drive through was backed up in two directions.  People were honking and yelling because they couldn't get out of their parking space.  I will never darken the door of this Starbucks again!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Dec 11, 2015~Since I moved to Arizona I have not found a Starbucks that I really liked coming from Portland there's a Starbucks on every corner, and they are fast. This is by far the best Starbucks but I've been to in Arizona everything is always babe great.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Mar 2, 2016~I live so close to this location and i love that they carry the reserve blends.  I came through the drive thru sick and explained i couldn't have my usual and the barista suggested that i try the peach green tea lemonade drink,  thats now my favorite drink. Thanks for the great suggestions.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Oct 9, 2015~Stopped by this new location for the first time today, and was pleased with the service! I used the drive through, and got my drink quickly. The cashier was very friendly and we had a nice conversation about my dog, who was in the car with me. I'm not often near this Starbucks, but I will definitely stop in again the next time I have a chance.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Nov 3, 2015~Now I haven't been inside the store but I have used the drive-thru three different times and I have to say I really like it!  Three stars are for the fact that this location took over the empty lot but I found the staff to be friendly and quick.
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~May 26, 2016~This was one of the worst Starbucks experiences I have ever had. I ordered a green iced tea, unsweetened. Not a hard drink to make. There were two gentlemen in front of me who ordered a black iced tea, and a mocha frappaccino light. Also not hard drinks. The man behind me got his cappuccino before any of our drinks were even made! Then, the woman making drinks only made one at a time. As a former Starbucks barista, I know there is a system in place so two drinks are being made at the same time. That means I had to wait even longer for a drink that take 10 seconds to make. After the gentlemen in front of me got their drinks, the barista looked at my cup, then grabbed one from another customer that had also ordered after me (and the one who got the cappuccino) and started making their drink. After their drink was finished, the barista deigned to make mine. On top of all of this, she was not wearing an apron, which violates all kinds of health codes. I am extremely unhappy with my service here. If you want care and attention, don't go to this Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85023~5~Jan 7, 2016~We came to this Starbucks during a recent road trip. Alyssa went above &amp; beyond in customer service! She made sure that our drinks were made to perfection. We couldn't be happier with how everything went and the drinks were delicious. :)
Phoenix, AZ 85023~1~Jun 12, 2016~2nd time this has happened to me here, I was waiting for my coffee for almost 20 minutes watching people that were behind me getting their drinks, but I don't want to be impatient, maybe those drinks are made faster than mine, I have no idea the time to make coffee, but I go up and stand where they hand out the drinks as the lady is bringing two or three more drinks over completely ignores us until I have to say excuse me a few times and told them I've been waiting on a venti double shot, and she said `"oh next time just tell us your here, you had a mobile order`" I'm no I've been sitting here for 15 minutes and standing here waiting for one of you to acknowledge me for another 5 minutes and I ordered and paid with that cashier who has also been watching me sit here and didn't say anything, then after 20 minutes of my drinking sitting they didn't even make me a new one she slides it in front of me and says `"it's right there`" well now it is
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 26, 2024~I just moved to the area and this Starbucks had the QUICKEST drive-thru line I've ever experienced at a Starbucks. I pre-planned 20 extra minutes for the visit but no need! Thank you for a great and fast start to my day
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Sep 9, 2024~Basically just getting ice from Starbucks at this point. Every time I go they fill the ice to the absolute brim. I can't imagine the employees do this willingly the management at Starbucks must be telling them to do this. Disappointing when coffee already costs $8.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 31, 2021~Bucks extremely well located for drive thru about a block North of Bell Ave on the right hand side of N. 7th st going North. When I walked in I was very impressed with the cleanliness. This maybe the cleanest Bucks I've been to anywhere.The shift manager, Adeeb, is an outstanding guy. I enjoyed talking to him and his customer service skills are A plus. I'm impressed with all the Starbucks stepping up the CS...competitors aren't close.The inside is on the small side but I am rating 5 stars for the staff quality and location, cleanliness.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Sep 19, 2020~They are super nice but very slow at taking orders. The line was pretty long. My drink was super sweet.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Dec 1, 2022~So I can see why the average is 3 stars the staff is friendly and work hard but I stopped in the day before to order coffee for my work and offered to pay for it that day the manager said no will have to be next day in the morning and wrote it down in a calendar. When I come I the staff had no knowledge of my order. They were helpful and worked hard to get my order but very poor communication between shifts will have to travel a little farther and get from Dunkin' next time.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jul 14, 2022~This used to be a good Starbucks. Fast drive thru.  Pleasant staff. Last two times I went there was no one I recognized. The Chai Tea Latte was white water. It didn't taste anything like it should. I'm not comfortable complaining and I thought this would be a one time mistake. Today was the same. The lid wasn't on. I went to taste my Oatmilk brown sugar espresso and it dumped all over me. The  barista said I'd squeezed the cup too hard. What??It tasted the same exactly the same as yesterday's Chai. I did ask them to remake it. Not any better. It didn't even look like they usually do. I won't be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Sep 22, 2023~Aylin was so nice, and considerate espically me acting like a Karen in the drive thru lol. Thank you for making my coffee with what you had going on!  :)
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Jun 11, 2020~I'm not sure if Starbucks recently did more training or what, because the last few times I've been the drinks have been way better. The service has even gotten better. The prices are still a bit too high for what you get, but hey we all love our caffeine so its worth it. This trip was good. Me and my fam got four drinks and they all came out perfect which is usually rare for Starbucks. I usually get iced coffee, but have been on a caramel macchiato with almond milk kick, and it was prepared perfectly. I used to work for starbucks back in the day, and the drink I had was exactly how its supposed to be. Thanks for stepping up the game Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Feb 3, 2023~This Starbucks is very concerning. I had to go inside due to a bee issue in the drive through. No biggie. Ordered and waited 15 minutes for a pink drink... while waiting, noticed that there was a swarm of bees by the door.. advised a barista to which I was greeted with a chuckle and then she turned away while giving me an eye roll. As someone who is deathly allergic to bees, this is very concerning. The store should be closed when these issues arise. I know I'm not the only one who is allergic. Not to mention just how unsanitary that is.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Nov 14, 2021~Usually we have nice service and usually don't have any issues with our orders but today was completely different. I got a iced venti chai tea and my cup was so full of ice I couldn't even stir it around, which we know that means more ice, less drink and if I'm paying $7 I'd rather not get jipped and my husband got a grande peppermint mocha and it wasn't even filled 3/4 of the way
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Nov 3, 2018~It's Frustrating when you frequent a place a few times and Every-time it's Wrong!! First time through the drive thru- My order was apparently knocked out order...so they started handing me a bunch of stuff that wasn't mine. Then I have to Flag her down at the window to let her know it's all Wrong. They give me a card for Freebie next time but I pulled off and they drink they gave me was Still Wrong!!! Argh!! Today, same deal...The staff there seems to be Sleep Walking and not concerned at All about Service. The New guy at the register kept saying he didn't know what he was doing!! Not very encouraging for confidence in the product in the cup...and it was Wrong!! Sigh!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Apr 29, 2018~This is light iced matcha  green tea latteI think not!!!!Extra ice to me!!!So disappointed
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Oct 17, 2019~Today for lunch I needed a coffee pick me up and decided to post mate some Starbucks.  First they ran out of the sandwich that I wanted so the lady called and I told her a grilled cheese would be fine.  It was gross!!!!! Second I ordered the dream bar.  They charged me $3.45 and the package actually says 2.50!!! See pics!! On the plus side, my iced coffee was good.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 14, 2021~I ordered a venti caramel frappachino with a shit ton of caramel and The barista named Kasey who's usually there around 6pm was making it and when we pulled up to the window she said to tell me when to stop adding caramel she is awesome!! Thank you!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jul 9, 2021~Because of the awesome baristas &amp; the outstanding service they provide is why boyfriend and i always have and always will go to this Starbucks location. Keep up the good works guys
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jul 9, 2021~You know it's extremely sad when you try and give places just one more chance and they just ruin it again for you. I ordered a venti iced white mocha with vanilla sweet cream cold foam, and it seemed like the people were new because they weren't understanding what that was. I go to the window and my drink has a sad excuse of whipped cream on it, I said it's supposed to be sweet cream cold foam, she showed me the drink I wanted I said yes but venti, she said so with that it's gonna be $12 dollars, HA! I never payed more than $7 for that drink ANYWHERE and I get this drink every time, I'm not understanding why this location ALWAYS HAS AN ISSUE WITH MAKING DRINKS. they have no idea what they were doing as usual, it seems like they have new management and employees everyday... sounds a little scammy, maybe it's time to just shut it down lol. Sad.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Mar 24, 2021~Been coming here for YEARS ever since it opened. I usually like to switch up my drinks but this past couple of years I've gotten blonde vanilla lattes,I literally got it the other day... not even 48 hours and the girl tells me she can't make it because they don't have it, very strange since that's a super basic drink and been on the menu for years but ok, the guy, not sure of their names, was very sad and sounded miserable, every time I go. He doesn't greet you like everyone else does, he hands you the drink but you have to almost break your arm cause he doesn't wanna reach out and doesn't say anything!! At all even after saying thank you so awkward. this place needs to get it together, they lost a loyal customer. Sad.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~May 16, 2021~Currently here as we speak. It states that their hours of operation on Sunday is 5AM got here at 5:20 AM then the staff proceeded to tell me at 5:40 they're opening later! So I've been waiting around to just get my coffee for 20 minutes. Extremely unprofessional and highly upset that they just get to decided when to open when their hours of operation states otherwise. Pissed to say the least
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Mar 25, 2016~My husband and I went to this location of Starbucks on Thursday, March 24th in the morning. There was a line at the drive thru, however, we didn't have long to wait as the line moved quickly. We go to this location often and it is always a good experience. The employees are friendly and efficient. They like to engage the customer in conversation and they seem to genuinely care about the customer and like their job as barista's. Our cold coffee drinks were fantastic as usual. We love this location and will be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Feb 17, 2020~The service here was incredIbly slow. While we were waiting for our drinks we saw them fail to give the couple before us one of their drinks. When probed about that they really steuffled to even fill the order and instead of apologizing  they made an excuse about the printer not working. Now to our order - They made one drink iced instead of hot despite the sticker saying hot. They just didn't make our second drink. Instead of apologizing when probed they said they thought it was a mobile order. Not sure how it being a mobile order would have made that delay worth it. Meanwhile the confusion seemed to happen when my drink was handed off from one worker to another so the first could go on break. They made themselves drinks and left while my empty cup sat there. When my drink was made it was really quite bad. I got a refresher and it was extremely watered down. I've never seen  one so light! I wouldn't go back to this location. Luckily there are many other Starbucks right in the area.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 9, 2022~Very unhappy with this location. They did a good job in the past but recently things have changed i'm not sure what. But yesterday I placed a mobile order to pick up my coffee before I went into work. I got there by the time it said it would be done, and it wasn't done. I sat there and waited for it for five minutes which made me late to work and I never got my coffee because they still hadn't started it. So I tried again today and placed my mobile order even earlier to make sure I can get my coffee before work. And when I got there granted they are busier location however that's not an excuse for not having any of the prior mobile orders done. So again I had to wait for my drink and I was late for work because it wasn't ready when it was supposed to be. The workers are very friendly but if something doesn't change with how they run this location I definitely will not be coming back.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Apr 24, 2019~I'll make this right to the point.. Their mobile ordering sucks. I'll get there and they don't have the order ready... Their excuse every time `" the printer isn't working`".  I hear this EVERY week!!!  Why can't they get it fixed???!!! Be invested in making your customers happy and to help your location be more efficient. Be more proactive.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Oct 5, 2021~Ariel was an absolute joy this morning!! She was bubbly and welcoming. Such a great experience!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Feb 16, 2020~Very slow service and multiple missed and incorrect orders while we stood waiting for our drinks to come out. Half the staff made their own drinks and went on break while we waited and then we had to ask after our drinks since the remaining staff were only serving the drive through. The struggle was real it seemed.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~May 10, 2020~Mobile order and arrived. Sign says to please get your order by going through the drive-through. Drive-through line is around the store so makes no sense to have mobile orders as a convenience. 15 minutes later I make it up to an employee and I ask why do I need to wait in this line. She says you don't you can go inside and pick it up. But the sign says... Oh no the door is open just go inside and get it. I get inside and get my drink. I tell The next employee at the sign is directing us to get in line instead of come inside. He says yeah OK. I can tell by the look in his eye he doesn't give a rip so I respond you are not going to do anything are you. All you have to do is take down the sign. He says no I have to get back to work. I said it is an A-frame sign just pull it inside or you can even erase it or update it with your magic marker. No he says and have a good day. I managed a Starbucks in the 90s when customers mattered and service was a priority. This store is god awful
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jan 24, 2019~Best Starbucks location I have ever been to! All of the employees are friendly and helpful, they get my complicated order right every time!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Nov 8, 2020~Chris told me my card was declining so I paid cash, when I got home my card was charged 3 x... went back to get my money and he said he could only refund me for one (Chris) what a joke. World is full of crooks.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Apr 30, 2013~My drink always taste great, however that is what you are paying for consistency and price! Convenient to have a drive through, but never is it quick. If they could work on the time it took to be and in and out with your drink they'd probably receive better reviews.Ill re review if anything changes!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Sep 20, 2019~9/20/19 7AM visit: The white girl in drive-thru with the head wrap around her was rude and has no customer service skills! I don't know why she's handling drive-thru! Our order was not processed correctly and instead of handling it properly she gives an attitude and has the audacity to be condescending! However, the Supervisor was nice and very professional.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Dec 30, 2019~I frequent this store at least 3 times a week, I've gotten the same order every time since the holiday drinks came out. Last week and today I had the same girl take my order, repeat it back to me, and ring it in correctly on the screen (chestnut praline latte), both times I got to the window she obnoxiously lunged halfway out the window and exclaimed that they don't have the caramel brulee latte anymore, to which I tell her that's not even the drink I ordered, and someone has to come up and correct her. She even recognized that she's done that to someone before in which I had to break the news that it was me she did it to AGAIN. Not sure why or how this has happened twice considering she's repeated my order back to me and rang it in correctly the first time. Thinking maybe she doesn't belong in the drive thru.Every other time is a great experience, just very annoyed that this somehow has been a reoccurring thing.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Mar 22, 2021~Best starbucks location, I've been customer here for a year now and i used to get coffee 2-4 times a week. Never had a bad customer service and i never had a great irish cold brew anywhere else than here.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 22, 2018~Coby was such a pleasure to get assistance from. Very friendly and courteous. Plus very knowledgeable about the different beverages. Clean location.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 16, 2019~This staff here at this location have always been very friendly. They went above and beyond good service quite a few times, most recently when the power was out due to a car accident. I feel they care about their customers and I haven't gotten that from the Starbucks near my apartment. I choose to spend my money at this location due to the great staff!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Oct 21, 2018~Always prompt with your order. Staff is friendly. Have a long drive thru lineup in the am.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~May 2, 2020~I'm sad they are closed during this time. I have visited this Starbucks almost daily for the past two years. Everyone is always so kind and has great customer service. They even started to remember my drink after being a regular. They have the friendliest baristas on 7th street and bell. I used to to go another nearby but the baristas were not welcoming. Hope they open this one back up soon.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Sep 9, 2018~This location is always out of stock. It's a giant shit show. The staff isn't engaged, and doesn't seem to care a lot of the time. Mobile orders are prioritized over walk in orders. Staff doesn't appear to be properly trained to work the register. I've gotten so many refunds because I've been overcharged.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Apr 20, 2018~This location is always out of Cold Brew. However it gets a 2 Star because the staff is pleasant and quick.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Jun 19, 2018~My typical drink here is a iced cold brew with vanilla and sweet cream creamer (the best iced coffee drink I've had here, aside from their frappuccinos).I started going to the Coffee Bean for a few weeks but I wasn't near one today so I thought I would order the same thing I typically get at Coffee Bean at Starbucks since it's a pretty simple order and it couldn't be further from what I get there. I ordered an iced americano with vanilla powder and half&amp;half and it was super bitter and I couldn't even taste the vanilla. So I decided to get a cold brew with vanilla syrup and half&amp;half.. still bitter and blah. Sadly I don't think I will make Starbucks my go to spot anymore since I have become spoiled at Coffee Bean. The barista (with dark hair/bangs) was extremely sweet &amp; helpful though in trying to find something that resembled what I was going for!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Nov 20, 2013~This location is right next to my house, I ALWAYS stop here in the mornings to get my coffee, yet refuse to go through the god-awful drive through. The average time from start to finish is like 12 minutes. I  dont order anything fancy, so why should I wait for other people to get their fancy drink order? I just want my black venti coffee and be on my way. So walking in is the only way to go. Ordering a breakfast sandwich will add 10 minutes to your wait time, dont do it. Its a fun place to study, very interesting conversations going on around you. They also have a lot of outlets so you can charge your laptop, phone, etc. The guy who works the counter in the mornings is really sweet. Egh, its a starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~May 20, 2012~Let me start by saying I love Starbucks. Seating inside is a bit haphazard and very few comfortable chairs. Today, their espresso machines were out of order and a hand written sign was on the door to let you know as you entered. Now anchor machine falling out of service may not be preventable, but both machines, including the one for the drive thru?Were out of large straws as well which suck for those of us who order venti or Trenta size drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jan 19, 2017~Every Thursday my Aunt and I come to this Starbucks and every single time Ron is absolutely wonderful! He is funny, conversational, and always makes the trip memorable! Today is the year anniversary of her mom passing away so today was a little hard but he made today a little brighter! He and the rest of the staff make my favorite weekly tradition even better! A big thanks from us! We love you guys(-:
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Oct 3, 2017~This is the 3rd time I've ordered on the app 10-15min before coming in and my order wasn't ready. They forgot about my drink twice and literally made it infront of me after I got there. This time they made my drink I get there and they're standing around no ones in line and they forgot the food or didn't see the ticket for it or whatever so I waited and they threw the egg bites in a bag no holder (they were out) and it soaked through the paper bag material and dropped out the bottom. I order on the app on my way to work aka I don't have time to wait. He goes to remake it... I obviously don't have time and he's like ok have a good day... I'm like do I not get a refund!?! This place is the worst but it's the only one close to my work so I'm going to keep coming in and I'll definitely keep complaining until they start to fix this location. I decided to be even later to work since I'm going to get chewed anyway might as well vent about this Starbucks before I go in. This place is the worst. If you can avoid it, do.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Apr 22, 2011~This is MY starbucks....I go almost every single day. These are the reasons. 1) On my way to work2) Right next to my bank3) They are SO friendly4) They understand when I'm off coffee and order `"black water`" that I mean a coffee of the day, black. 5) The sweet girl in the drivethrough that is there almost every day I go always acts like it is her fault when I spill an entire venti hot coffee in my car. Even though I have an insurance policy on my car upholstery for a reason.....and it's not bad lids...it's that I should live in a bubble so as not to injure others!Love My Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~May 13, 2017~Normally this Starbucks is fine but today I had to listen to two obnoxious teenagers make fun of customers and their drinks while waiting for my coffee. McDonald's likely would have had better service. On girl with green hair was particularly loud in making fun of paying customers. Disgusted.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Sep 15, 2017~It seems like this location has gone downhill over the last few months. You can stress something enough in your order and they do it anyways.  It just seems like they've gotten lazy.  I hate to be that person who calls back about their order but, if you make my order wrong for the 5th time AND the frappuccino is completely melted consisting of mostly melted whipped cream then yes I'm going to call.  I can safely say that this is the crappiest frappuccino I've ever had.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Nov 14, 2014~Slow at the drive thru!!Grateful to get a couple comped drinks after a 10 minute wait in the drive through.Also it's hard to hear the word `"blonde`" on the speaker.  Also the barista complained to us about another customer.  Real professional.  Especially when he mouthed `"wtf`" to us!!  Kinda funny good thing we are cool people!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Sep 18, 2013~Not a fan of this location.  Try the one on 3rd ave &amp; south side of bell.Wow, someone actually managed to ruin a Starbucks location!!  Slow drive through, condescending service, and overall lack of interest on the part of the employees. We stopped in on my hunny's birthday on our way to vegas. This is the location closest to us so we wanted to just get in and out.  The voice on the drive through was kinda short with us, but I get it- you're busy.  We finally get to the window after over 10 minutes waiting.  The guy does not give us our gift card back.  I go inside and they can't find it. My hunny goes inside, and at least gets them to look for it and reprint the receipt.  Starbucks corporate reissued the card for us a few days later so in ended up fine.  Still, this location has no urgency!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Mar 6, 2017~Worst service Starbucks ever. No smiles. No acknowledgement. No thank you. Nothing. Perhaps they are robots. Corporate need to visit this with a secret customer to see how bad they really are. How hard is it to be nice?
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Mar 3, 2016~Last night I was working on my laptop at this location and was appalled by the employees. I work at SB often and am always pleased but in the hour I was here, the baristas were incredibly loud and offensive. They chased each other around the restaurant, hit each other, were continually laughing loudly, and playfully yelling at each other. One yelled across the store at a coworker, calling her a douchebag; the other yelled it back twice. They had a loud, two-minute conversation about poop, ranging from baby poop to `"old-person poop.`" One was wearing a black shirt that revealed her midriff. The word sh!t was used repeatedly. Two of them had their phones out at various points, showing pictures to the other employees. This was all done very loudly and it was obvious that I was not the only one who noticed. There was no friendly conversation between the baristas and the customers; in fact, it felt dang near unwelcoming, like they wished they could just have the place to themselves. This is an terrible representation of the respectable SB name.My coffee was good.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jun 24, 2019~I use the drive thru at this location all time early morning week days and today I visited later than usual and it was not a good experience it was actually horrible and disgusting. I grabbed my usual iced coffee and it was spilling all over my car as I drove so I waited to put the straw in until I got home and could control the spilling to then realize there was a hair in coffee stuck in the seal of the lid thank gosh so it was as visible before I drank it. Worst part was I didn't even get an apology until they gave me my remade drink and she then stated `"sorry it's all girls in here`" as if that would have made me feel better. I'm so grossed out, do better Starbucks !
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Dec 26, 2012~Worst service at a Starbucks I have ever experienced.  Keesh was rude and I will never recommend nor go to that Starbucks ever again.  The sad thing is there are way too many Starbucks with friendly good hearted people for me to put up with this particular negative store.  The coffee is the same in every store so why not go to another Starbucks or even The Coffee Bean.  I was so disrespected they received a comment/complaint on the corporate website from me.One chance is all they got.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 24, 2017~These girls are having a difficult time this morning. Not friendly at all and screwed up my order twice. I hope they at least made it decaf so I don't die in an hour. Go to this location at you own risk.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Apr 7, 2016~Hope you are not in a hurry because this is the slowest Starbucks location I have ever encountered. I thought they were doing better but not today. I've been sitting in the drive thru line for 10 minutes and there were only 3 cars including me. I don't understand why they are so slow!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Aug 23, 2018~I placed my mobile order as I was sitting at the light at 7th Ave and the 101. With Phoenix Morning rush hour traffic, it took me about 10 minutes to arrive at the location for my order, When I went inside, my order was not completed or the ticket pulled. As they continued to make drinks for the drive thru ( as I pulled into the lot behind a PV school van and they were at the window getting their drink, while I was still waiting), mine sat on the blender. I had to ask if someone could finish my drink as I was in a hurry, that's why I use mobile ordering.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 12, 2017~This is my go to North Phoenix Sbux. Staff is friendly, drinks are fast and accurate. All around a nice experience!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Sep 1, 2015~Average Starbucks location. Came here cuz it's close to my wife's work. Was hoping for a comfortable spot to get some work done. There are only 2 comfy chairs which were taken of course and small tables otherwise. One plus is there is a large conference table but not outlets at it.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~May 9, 2014~It's hard to find a place where people are happy amd cheerful at 430am on a friday morning lol. Well you can tell that the Starbucks staff at this location are trying their best to help everyone get their morning started off on the right foot. Im never happy waking up early, let alone having to work befor 6am so my hats off to them. This Starbucks is located very close to my house and the fact they have free-wifi gives me a nice place to enjoy a morning coffee while checking morning emails or just browsing the web. The coffee drinks are a little pricey but they generally are of high quality so its worth the little bit of extra money.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 7, 2014~I love that the staff is CHILL here. You won't find extra perky teenagers playing loud music at 7am. Yessss. Sometimes you just want to skip all the bs.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Apr 17, 2016~Worst customer service! A bunch of people working and took a few minutes to take orders. Then my iced coffee came up with no cream, so I asked the girl to put in the cream, and she got an attitude when she did, then didn't even stir it before giving it back. Then my friend got hers back and asked if it was supposed to have whip cream on hers because it never did before, the girl gave her attitude about that too. Worst Starbucks I've been too and it doesn't taste good either.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Aug 5, 2017~Second Saturday in a row that they don't have cold brew. And the breakfast sandwich that I like. And the drive thru is extra slow on Saturday's.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jul 2, 2020~worse location ,the staff is always rude . drive thru always forgets to give food items they  ! always gives me the wrong drink or makes it completely gross with no effort ! always closing random hours now and they wait until you wait in line forever to tell you at the window their closed lol...
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Apr 4, 2018~This Starbucks has to be the best ran, best customer service, cleanest Starbucks that I have even visited.  Ashley and her team are great.  I can't say enough about this Starbucks (I run my business out of Starbucks in AZ, Seattle and California) this is by far the best one in the company.  Great Job to Ashley and her team.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Feb 11, 2013~This used to be one of my favorite spots but lately it's been dirty almost every time I visit. Having been a barista, I know you can get slammed and get behind on the housekeeping but I have witnessed several times that employees seem oblivious to the mess on the floor, under tables, on chairs and around the condiment bar. The staff is always friendly and I still like to go but it's weird to sit and enjoy my java while looking at all the debris on the floor. I also inquired of one barista regarding what kind of milk they used, specifically asking about rgbh or rbst. She said they just buy the run-of-the-mill milk like the kind at Safeway etc. I will stick with the java &amp; espresso - don't want no hormones or steroids in my latte!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jun 13, 2015~Some days they have horrible service. But I enjoy most Monday's and Tuesday's here. They have a good team working the morning shift around 7am. I think his name is Jay. He's super friendly and has a very calm personality who knows how to get things done and right. I will continue coming here 3 times a week!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~May 8, 2015~Some days they have horrible service. But I enjoy most Monday's and Tuesday's here. They have a good team working the morning shift around 7am. I think his name is Jay. He's super friendly and has a very calm personality who knows how to get things done and right. I will continue coming here 3 times a week!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Aug 14, 2013~based on my one experience here it was positive. I used the drive through, the lady at the window was very nice.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Dec 17, 2013~The service is mediocre here. The drive thru is a very convenient but sometimes slow. They tend to be slower than most other stores and this store can get crowded really quick. I use this store because of the convenient location.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Dec 17, 2013~This has to be the SLOWEST Starbucks I have ever been to. I don't understand it. It doesn't matter the time of day/week -- its slow. If you don't have a good 20 minutes to wait, go elsewhere. And people if you have over 2-3 drinks to order DON'T use the drive thru! That's just common sense, right?! We got stuck behind someone that ordered 7 drinks! Not kidding... 7! Who does that?
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Jan 4, 2014~Great coffee, inside location isn't the best for hanging out and spending time catching up though.  The outside is fairly nice and offers more space.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Aug 10, 2013~Terrible service and the longest wait for your coffee. Even at 5:00am! I was told to 'wait' while the barista slowly, leisurely took out pastries from a box and placed in the case. I literally had to double check their times on the front door to make sure they were open - they had been for 30 minutes.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Mar 5, 2017~Skip this Starbucks! I've only continously have had issues with this Starbucks. The first instance that really stuck out was one morning we went, I asked for light ice. I was given a drink with heavy ice and asked them politely to remake the drink because I specifically asked light. The one gentleman asked one of the ladies there who was making the iced drinks while he man the hot drinks to remake the drink. She proceeded to act like I was not standing there and began to speak derogatory that she had to remake the drink. The gal who was manning the drive through must have immediately seen the look of horror on my face and began to apologize. I left and later contacted their management. Another instance was I was driving home and noticed my drink was very milky, but I like to sip my steamed milk part of my macchiato slowly. It wasn't till getting closer to home I realized that they never added the espresso. They were nice enough to make another drink, but it was inconvenient having to drive back. The only  reason I have gone back since because it is the closest to my house going north on 7th St. Since then the drink are always poorly made, and their services lacks luster. I don't visit this location any longer, I'll visit the one on 3rd St before this one. I'll even wait closer to my office near 7th St and Missouri before I get a coffee here.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Oct 13, 2014~Pretty good location, friendly barristas, the usual mainstream music playing, triple shot lattes with 2 pumps of vanilla galore.  Pretty close to home, might be the new go-to starbucks spot.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 28, 2014~Ok. First things first, this is the location near my friends apartment and I go to Starbucks almost everyday. I walk in to the lobby the first day and I ordered a breakfast sandwich(and somehow they gave me a lemon loaf cake which they were annoyed to exchange even though I had my receipt in hand), and I also ordered a iced white mocha. The girl on the register was obviously new and confused and it took her a really long time to get everything in the system and the manager on duty was obviously annoyed with her asking for help. The second time I went to this location I used the drive thru thinking it would be better, my friend got a black coffee and I got an iced coffee figuring this order was a lot harder to mess up....WRONG. My iced coffee didn't have WM sweetener like I asked it had classic syrup and cream instead. And to make matters worse... I am an employee of Starbucks. I gave the girl my employee numbers and she said `"wow you are a dinosaur`" UMM THANKS?! It has the potential to be a good location but far from it now.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Nov 7, 2013~If I could give them 0 stars I would. There's one nice younger boy who works occasionally. Other than him the staff is full of the rudest set of sorority rejects Starbucks could get. It's obvious they none of them want to be there and their sense of urgency is non existent. Don't go here if your in a rush to work! I avoid this Starbucks and just go to the coffee bean a few minutes out of the way. The few minutes out of the way is still better than waiting 15 minutes for a drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Mar 16, 2014~Generally speaking I almost always receive excellent customer service at most Starbucks locations. This particular spot is one of the few exceptions. I am consistently met with a poor attitude, forgotten orders, and improperly toasted bagels. The baristas don't like it when you try to make eye contact and act as if it's a huge inconvenience when someone walks in the door (unless you're the Jimmy John's delivery guy, then you're welcomed with cheers and smiles). If it weren't so close to home I'd never return. Alas, convenience makes a slave of us all.
Basha's 113~5~Feb 24, 2019~Stopped by after a long trip. Our Barista was all alone in the shop inside this grocery store. Although there weren't so many people waiting in line she was quick, efficient and most of all VERY FRIENDLY.  Her name is Limor, beautiful name. She deserves all the credit. Keeping up with our SIX DRINK ORDER. While keeping her friendliness and customer service. When we come by this area again in a few weeks, we hope she's here again for the great drinks and service.
Basha's 113~5~Jul 5, 2022~This is the only Starbucks I go to - everyday for my coffee. This is because the manager, John, well trains his employees as well as himself. I have no issues ordering any drink from this store. It is always made correctly and efficiently which is hard to find in Starbucks nowadays! I will definitely be sad if he leaves anytime soon! Keep up the good work, this is definitely the best Starbucks I've been too!
Fry's~4~Aug 10, 2019~Starbucks in frys. Service was quick and friendly. I requested a. Extra pump of caramel and they were happy to oblige. Made it great, and just how I like it. Store was very clean.
Fry's~1~Jul 3, 2021~Horrible service by Lena, and the management team. Avoid this franchised location by Fry's due to lack of customer service and professionalism.
Fry's~1~Oct 17, 2021~They were out of just about everything.I had to wait 5 minutes for a basic hot coffee. Wouldn't recommend this Starbucks.
Fry's~1~Nov 5, 2019~This location is a joke. I was just served by a young gentleman today around 1:30pm, and not only did he not greet me, but didn't even ask for a name for the order. He also apparently doesn't understand the meaning of `"light ice`" so when I was greeted with a rude `"Huh?`" `"What??`" I was beyond annoyed. I said my please and thank you and waited for my drink. He made my drink, left it sitting behind the counter, rather than giving it to me to sip on while he made the second drink, and took the order of 4 other customers. I had enough time to go put groceries back because I just couldn't wait to leave the store. Finally after about a 12 minute wait, he handed me my drinks and said `"you're welcome.`" I sure hope employee evaluations are coming up soon because this was by far the rudest Starbucks service I've ever had out of a location I already have low expectations of.
Fry's~1~Jul 27, 2019~Always have limited expectations for Starbucks stores located inside grocery stores, but this location never delivers a good experience.  Understaffed, never have their full food menu which is limited to 3 choices as it is, slow service, unhappy employees.  The appeal of Starbucks is the consistency, someone tell this store.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Mar 4, 2022~The Employee's that work here are extremely friendly and very good at what they do. Amazing customer service, I go here whenever i need my fix for coffee there really is no better place to go to than here because you can also get your shopping done it really is one of the best locations Starbucks has. P.S. Depending on who you ask, there is an awesome custom drink you can ask for that taste exactly like the turtles candy bar. called `"The Turtle`" Very sweet drink but it taste's amazing.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 21, 2022~If you want to find the one and only Starbucks with kind workers, head over to this one. I kid you not. From the time I placed my order to arriving at the window, top notch. Nobody is ever nice at Starbucks anymore. This location is worth the visit. Say hi to Arjay and that cute little thing who was taking orders! Thank you to the manager who came over and talked to me so I could give her crew a compliment. I'm still enamored by the kindness!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 10, 2016~I've been to many different Starbucks and this one is kind of my least favorite.  It's located inside the Safeway store which is good when you're wanting a coffee on your way out the door.  The reason I gave it two stars is because of the staffing.  There use to be regular workers there that I saw every time I went but ever since they finished school and left, there has been a huge turn over.  I rarely see the same faces anymore and each one is worse than the previous one.Three times I've been there and waited around for someone to walk up to the register until I decided to just leave after standing there for 10+ minutes without any service.  Other times I've been there and actually had the baristas make the coffee drinks of people that ordered after me and they'd make mine last which would make me late to work.  Or my favorite is when they start my drink and are almost done, but then customers walk in the door and they stop my order to take the orders of everyone standing in line and then they start all of their drinks before finishing mine.  Again, making me late for work because a 10 min stop turned into 30 mintues.Nothing really wrong with the drinks, I'm just tired of their customer service.  Constantly being passed up in the morning and lucky if I can find anyone in the afternoon.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 21, 2019~I give this Starbucks one star for the reason that they don't know how to make coffee here. They put too much milk can't taste the coffee. So if you go here Starbucks on 35th and Bell, take your coffee home and add more coffee so you won't have hot milk.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 6, 2020~They always have amazing customer service and I never have to wait too long. This morning around 10:20 (01/06/2020) I went through the drive thru and Rilee (I think that's her name! Blonde hair) was so helpful and sweet and made my experience wonderful.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 19, 2014~Don't come on a Monday. Sheesh, you will be here forever.Hire more than one person maybe. 3:30 to 4:00 you should not have to wait 20-25 minutes in line.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Feb 14, 2018~Love the staff that work at this location. There are days when they wait can be a little long, but they take the time to get to know their customers and vice versa.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 13, 2014~Great quick little Starbucks to stop at in the morning to get a cup of coffee. There is never a line and you can get in and out fast.
Safeway~5~Jun 30, 2022~Great stop. Barista was polite and helpful in getting us espresso grounds when asked for. Try their new cookies and cream cake pop.Got lucky and had a turkey bacon breakfast sandwich. Normally around this time, the sandwich is sold out.
Safeway~5~Oct 7, 2021~This is the first Starbucks in a supermarket I've been to with a nice seating area with comfortable lounge chairs. The regular Starbucks across the street doesn't even have comfy lounge chairs. This Safeway one is also open until 8pm vs. 7pm for the regular SB directly across the street.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Sep 5, 2024~excellent customer service, everything is freshly baked and packaged for our enjoyment, and the drink service outstanding, when people say extra caramel this is what we mean;)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jul 11, 2022~I love starbucks. This was my first time at this location, the drink tasted good but not really sure why it wasn't filled up. I ordered a normal drink on the menu, so it's not like I tried to cheat the system. I didn't feel like saying anything at the window but come on guys, paying for a latte should be a full cup.. I am loving these new shaken espresso drinks. The toasted vanilla is my new favorite. The brown sugar one is pretty good as well!The staff was friendly and quick. I placed a mobile order, and because the barista wasn't paying attention I almost got another Chris's mobile order  I said I only had one drink so took what was mine but y'all should be more careful because the other Chris might've not been happy if his drink wasn't ready when he came. Overall, I'll keep coming to starbucks. I'll give this location another try and we'll see if they fill up my cup to what I pay for
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Sep 27, 2023~Coffee was good but the staff are rude as hell. These people need to understand that us customers pays their salaries. I don't expect 5 star service but I do expect respectful employees when I'm paying $7 a cup and spent $30 on few items. And bathroom is gross
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Dec 23, 2022~It's better to go into the Safeway, they make the drinks perfect every time. The service and friendly and they know what they're doing.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 11, 2022~This is probably the worst Starbucks I've been to. They were out of all the flavors or add ins for the drinks I get and I have like 3 drinks I normally get. There was no mango juice, or dragonfruit so you can't do the Mango Dragonfruit Lemonade or the Peach Mango Black Tea Lemonade. I ordered a grande mocha frappe and they gave me a caramel frappe first then I had to wait 5-7 minutes at the window for the correct mocha drink to be made. It was not worth the wait either the grande cup was not filled all the way and it tasted like s***. Literally the worst mocha I've ever had. Sad to say but this Starbs SUCKS, please do not waste your time here. I won't be here to try again no other location has been this bad, you don't get your cup full and you wait for forever to get a drink that tastes like crap or wasn't what you had wanted originally.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 10, 2023~Very organized supermarket, clean restrooms and several practical services within it , including a Starbucks with awesome customer service! Their deli section looks fresh, the produce well stocked.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jun 6, 2024~The rudest employee I ever had the displeasure of meeting today worked at the Starbucks at 3549 W Bell, Phoenix Az.. when I needed to return a drink that was made incorrectly and request the correct drink. The employee 'Genesis' was the most offensive person I ever had the displeasure of meeting. I will never go to this Starbucks again. I have worked in the food and beverage field over the past 40 years. Which I Love. If I ever had treated a customer the way this 'lady' treated me, I would have been fired.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 26, 2023~Today is 50% off any cold drink and I went to a Starbucks previously but my coupon wasn't working so I came to this one and it still didn't go through. Although it wasn't going through, Adi (I hope I'm spelling it correctly) was able to figure out a solution quickly for us. She was really friendly and helpful. I appreciate that so much because the barista at the other location was no help. :(  Thank you for recognizing and helping us out today!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 1, 2024~absolutely horrible - HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE !!!!! the lady here - name is Jordan - when I asked her if she was going to take my name - she said oh well theyll just call it out in cafe - I'm a barista at another location , for another company and I know for a fact that is just not proper etiquette: in GENERAL. Then to add more , i ordered a grilled cheese and she asked me what do I want , rolled her eyes as if it was a problem that the answer to her own - unfinished question was yes I want my grilled cheese sandwich warmed up please - look I've been in customer service for over 20 years and even at month one of my journey I knew and understood common sense and proper mannerism. shout out to management here: bc this is your fault - lace your employees with style, grace and some f:;?!&amp;$ game man! Even one of the employees here yelling out `" it's a nightmare in here !`" As I type this : no duh !
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 20, 2024~Went to this Starbucks around 8 pm when they close at 9:30pm and there was no lights on and when I let them know I had ordered ahead and I showed up at the time it said it would be done the girl with the dark hair and arm tattoo on her left side said `" we just received that I would really appreciate it if you would put your order in earlier and come a little later`" pulled up to the window the we could see inside and the two girls were on the phone and laughing and when they finally got to doing the drinks they both hadn't washed their hands after handling their phones and went on to make our drinks. When the finally got done opened the window and practically threw out drinks at us and just shut the window. We were missing drinks and when we let them know we were they said that we didn't and we went back and forth and showed them the confirmation on the phone they looked back onto the screen and said oops looks like we might have pushed it out without making it. The drink was shoved into our face again and when we said thank you slammed the window in our face again. This is not the first time this has happened with either of those girl especially the one with dark hair and the shoulder tattoo if your working customer service I would think you would have better attitude then that and if they are doing that to us then they are doing it to everyone and need to go back to training or not be employed there anymore. * had to add a star just because it had me do it*
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Sep 3, 2023~Vanilla Latte's... should be sweet and taste like vanilla. And I know the employees here will disagree with this but... you are paid to make correct drinks and treat people with respect. This Starbucks does neither. Everyone should just go to Desert Eagle down the street. It's just better.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 7, 2023~I ordered online at this Starbucks location after driving some distance. I chose the pick up in store option and it was readily accepted and debited my account. Upon arriving at the store I found that the `"in store`" was closed and my only option was to use the drive thru. Unfortunately, I was driving a vehicle that couldn't navigate the drive thru lane. There were no cars in the drive thru so I walked up to the window. The worker there was very rude and told me that I couldn't walk up to the drive thru. Fine, I asked if he could pass it to me through the stores door. He rudely told me that he wouldn't do that. Now I have to go through the hassle of getting a refund online. Extremely poor management and customer service by allow online orders, but not following through. I've finally had it with Starbucks and will be asking for my credit card to be credited the amount in my account. Which will be immediately closed. I will never step into a Starbucks again. This was probably a blessing in disguise since they are overpriced and unhealthy anyways.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 29, 2022~You guys are still the best! My white chocolate mocha was the best one I've had lately! Kudos to the barista! Also got a banana nut loaf and the guy brought over the tray of loafs and let me pick my choice. I didn't ask,  he just offered it.  That has never happened before! I picked a big fat slice! Thanks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 12, 2020~I rate my caramel brulee latte a 10!! Excellent! Tasty and actually full and heavy! Great job!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Aug 31, 2019~Amazing experience!!! Amanda &amp; Emily are great! They took my very special request order of a drink I previously had made at another starbucks, and they recreated it! Super patient with me, which I appreciate, and made it taste actually 2x better than my first one! Extremely happy as the Easter bunny on this beautiful Sunday. Thank you guys so much!Months later! Another superior time here at Starbucks! They are always super patient with me and extra friendly! Kaelin/Katie took my order and were awesome!!! Thank you all a ton!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 21, 2019~Amazing experience!!! Amanda &amp; Emily are great! They took my very special request order of a drink I previously had made at another starbucks, and they recreated it! Super patient with me, which I appreciate, and made it taste actually 2x better than my first one! Extremely happy as the Easter bunny on this beautiful Sunday. Thank you guys so much!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 16, 2020~I am so FRUSTRATED!!! I do a mobile order but still have to sit in the damn drive thru line instead of walking inside, with my mask of course, to pick up my MOBILE order.What is the point of a mobile pick up if you still have to waste time in the drive through line????And I can't cancel my order because you already took my money. I have somewhere to be.The person that handed me my drinks kept saying well at least you can still pick it up here we're the only one really open at least you can pick it up here at least you can pick it up here not understanding my frustration won't be coming back to this location.And to top it off my drink was wrong!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Aug 31, 2022~Where is the old crew that was just there a few weeks ago. This new group are not too bright. This girl literally would not take my change with my bills to make a full dollar back in change because she said she would have to cancel my whole order, refund me and ring it in that way to calculate it for her. I guess counting to 100 was too hard. I asked for a lid for my pupcup because she handed it to me in a drink carrier and it was getting all over everything, I didn't want it all over my car and she said we `"don't have short cups`". I asked what they would put an espresso shot in and she froze, closed the window and walked away. WTH?
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jun 13, 2023~This 2 star rating is not for your employees but for you, corporate.   I grew up down the street from the first Portland, OR Starbucks,  I spent undergrads and graduate schooling studying and spending money in your store before it was cool or had a drive thru.  I have spent too much discretionary income in your store over the last 30 years and mostly to support your free education and benefits for your employees.  Today I ordered a venti shaken espresso in a grande cup and was told I could not and that I would have to pay more to add the extra shot to a grande drink making the grande size more expensive than the venti size with the same number of shots.  The venti has to much milk and sugar,  I want to taste my espresso.   This is just stupid  to charge me more and I will not give you my money again.  I've been coming to this location for 4 years 5-7 days a week.  You do the math,  usually get food too.  Chow
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 13, 2020~These guys are the best.   I've had very inconsistent experiences at Starbucks in Phoenix.   Now I am a critic but that is because I have been a Starbucks customer since there first expansion store in Portland, OR.   Customer service has changed since then but these guys (Scot, Colin, Michaela) have it dialed in old school.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 10, 2020~I went for something refreshing, &amp; let me tell you I got something refreshing! I got a strawberry lemonade on the rocks &amp; that drink smacked! The person who made my drink said its great blended, I'll be back next week to try that. Who ever made this drink really blessed me today. *chef's kiss* 10/10
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Sep 22, 2022~Meagan was truly unpleasant. I would not recommend her to work any positions that involves communicating with human beings. The drinks were fine.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Sep 4, 2021~Went here on a Saturday evening during Labor Day weekend and I was having a really bad day. To my surprise I got the sweetest genuine person ever! I believe her name is Cheyanne. She was so attentive while taking my order and just so very sweet, her high energy and excellent customer service skills made my day! Thank you for that.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Aug 27, 2021~The staff at this location is always friendly and polite when I go in. I have never had an order messed up and if my drink sits `"too long`" before I get there after ordering on the app they always offer to remake it (though I never take them up on it it's a nice offer)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Oct 19, 2021~Kids temp apparently means make it as hot as physically possible. I'm only typing more because it's making me in order to post it. The place reads it back and still messes it up. Impressive in itself which is why I gave it 3.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Sep 23, 2019~Been here a few times last time I was waiting for a long time at the window of the drive through but they gave me a grande for no extra cost. Today I went to get a Carmel ribbon crunch, it was me and a car behind. I was waiting at the window for about 5-6 minutes before the lady greeted me and took my card. There was a guy cleaning up, he could've helped while the girl was taking the other persons order. I get my drink and there is no Carmel at the bottom, it is watery, and there are none of those crunchy thing the put on the top. Poor service, gonna find a different Starbucks to go to.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Nov 29, 2021~Worst drink ever tasted nothing like how it's supposed to taste super disappointed I wanted this since last night and was so excited to wake up and get coffee literally tasted like gross water and it's supposed to be a flat white.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Jan 31, 2021~Ordered 2 caramel ribbon crunch Frappuccino's at the drive through. When I questioned the barista as to why they didn't have caramel on top she told me it does not come on top, just on the bottom. If you look at the menu it shows it drizzled on top. The drive through was super fast today though!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 21, 2021~This is my favorite Starbucks solely due to my favorite barista ever-Barbi!! She is full of joy and life and love. She is the reason is stop there almost everyday!! She acknowledges my kids and they love saying hi to her! I wish all of my Starbucks experiences were like the ones I have with her!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Dec 30, 2020~I've made this store in particular my go-to! The staff is always so friendly and patient, even if there's a line. They made my birthday drink for me with `"Happy Birthday`" written on the side and the lid, with confetti drawn on! It was so sweet of the staff. Timely and correct orders with kind people working there- you can't ask for much else!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 28, 2019~Came in for a Trenta frap and they said they don't make them that size. I always get that size at other locations. When handing my change he said there you go and hand me my change. No thank you or I am sorry and no receipt. Bad customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Sep 15, 2019~This Starbucks is my favorite location.  Everyone is so friendly here.  Sometimes I stop in with a list of 8 or 9 drinks for my employees and the baristas will take my list and make them all.  I expect to wait for that many drinks but they make them so fast.  They are cheerful and helpful here.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jun 14, 2019~Ordered a grande hot chocolate. The cup was 2/3 full. Went back couple days later let them know.  I was told it was policy. Seriously!!??  My policy is to pay for and get a full cup, especially at the prices they charge. I have a friend that is a trainer with Starbucks. She advised this is not policy.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 3, 2020~The drive through was hopping so I went inside.  The baristas were busy but took the time to greet me and send me off to meet my day with a genuine smile and  goodbye! They always make my day and my drink correctly. Love this store!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Mar 5, 2020~The drive through was hopping so I went inside.  The baristas were busy but took the time to greet me and send me off to meet my day with a genuine smile and heartfelt goodbye! They always make my day and my drink correctly. Love this store!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 26, 2021~If I could give a zero I would. What a joke! I went in with my computer about dusk to sit for a few minutes and use my computer. The entire place was empty. The employees said I could not sit down ( I am pregnant also by the way). They said I was welcome to sit at their tables outside. I said you mean by the homeless people who have set up their bedroom at your tables as all of them were occupied by NON patrons of the business. They said we can not enforce who sits outside. I said really it is your property and your chairs. You can enforce inside the building but you tell me I can only sit outside where there is no where to sit in an UNSAFE neighborhood in my opinion as it is getting dark. All because of COVID. What a complete joke and what complete idiots. Go where you are welcome and where they have balls to tell trespassers to get off their property and only allowed seating for PAYING customers.  Just terrible customers service.  Also did they not hear COVID number are down. Let's move on people.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jul 13, 2019~Morning crew rocks! Not sure if it's different employees morning, and then evenings but I can totally see AND taste the difference. if you like a whole lot of milk in your drink, rushed service and seeing dirty countertop with no caps on the milk (um bugs?..sneezes?), used coffee cup caps, the ice scooper on the dirty counter, the ice bin open for contamination, and drizzle spilled all over .. then go past 2pm. if you like an adult tasting coffee, not burned espresso, and amazing service then go in the mornings! yes it's extra busy because people are going to work but 1. they apologize if you wait 2. they're super friendly 3. they always greet and remember my doggy!! a bad coffee  can mess with your day, they don't mess up and they are extremely organized! Good rule of thumb for Starbucks.... always add less milk-  we can always ask for MORE but you waste product and time when you make an iced latte taste like milk...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 12, 2020~Always has a long drive thru line. Tried this place 3 times and they always messed up my order. They keep charging me different prices for the same order each time as well.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 10, 2020~Thank you for always making my drinks perfect. I pulled up Amanda greeted me and then said your usual and had my three drinks down pat. They are not normal drinks either. This day I had a migraine not a good start to my morning and she made me smile. First time this has happened to me with my order. She has a good memory. Thank you to all the employees there for always being so kind every time I am there.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Feb 24, 2019~Let me start off by saying, 'I'm not a coffee drinker'. Everyone once in a while I like having hot chocolate or tea and was happy when they turned this former Burger King into a Starbucks. However that start to slide downhill from there. First off, the place is nice and roomy with plenty of places to sit. The person at the counter said it's the largest Starbucks in the state which sounded cool. We arrived at about 07:50 PM which we were told the lobby closed at 08:00 but thought that meant they would just not let anyone else in at that time. We placed our order of one peppermint hot chocolate and a regular hot chocolate with pastries. Well, a few people order after us and were given their orders but didn't think much about it at the time. We were then asked if we received our order yet. We let them know we didn't in which we repeated what we ordered and they still got it wrong. Mind you, it was not busy at the time.Then, who I believe was the supervisor, proceeded to tell everyone that they had to leave now. Now believe me when I say, I completely understand that people want to clean up and go home at the end of the day but in my humble opinion, kicking people out of an establishment is a customer service no no. Especially if they're open until 09:00 PM at the drive thru. I would most likely not recommend this Starbucks to anyone looking for a place in the evening hours. Most likely you'll end up being thrown out on the street.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Oct 30, 2020~I just wanted to acknowledge the extra step these wonderful employees go. They have signs through their drive through, inspirational. Made my entire day!! The little things you do really do make a difference, keep doing what you're doing guys!! You're awesome
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Feb 1, 2020~Skip this location.  The drive thru is always painfully slow.  Drive a mile to I-17 &amp; Bell, way faster there.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jun 26, 2019~I get very frustrated with this Starbucks on Wednesday  mornings because they are particularly slow... this morning I am extra frustrated. I arrived in the drive thru at 9:05 AM (when my order was taken), I had maybe 4 cars in front of me, it took until 9:21 for me to receive my drink. I have never waited in a Starbucks drive thru this long before. I was then 10 minutes late to my meeting this morning. Please stop putting inexperienced baristas on in the AM hours as so many people are on a time schedule on their way to work. In the past, if I ever had to wait more than 10 minutes in a Starbucks drive thru, they have passed out 5 dollars of rewards points and I felt as if that was kind for the inconvenience. However, to roll up to the window, and not even have the barista apologize for the wait is unheard of. Very disipointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 21, 2019~this starbucks is so sweet &amp; welcoming!! my friend and i ride our horses through drive throughs all the time to get food and coffee, and the starbucks closest to us usually isn't very nice. we ended up over by this one so we decided to give it a try. they were so sweet and excited. definitely our new favorite:)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jun 8, 2020~Every time I place my mobile order it's ready when I arrive. All of the employees that work at this location are amazing and very friendly. I have yet for them them to be out of stock with anything I've ordered. I would recommend this Starbucks to anyone in the area!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~May 21, 2019~This is my first time at this location and it might be awhile before I go back. First off the screen is not working so you can't see your order.  I gave them my order and they repeated it back to me correctly. So I pull around and wait. I get to the window and the guy says you got the cold brew, tall water and blueberry muffin and I said no I got the iced caramel macchiato melted. He looks at me like I was making it or something and says hold on and starts talking to the girl taking orders and I said you guys repeated it back to me correctly, and he says we are really busy. Um ya I get that.  I wasn't really annoyed till they gave me my drink back layered and did not taste that good. I know 1st world problems but if I'm spending that much for coffee and you want a tip then do my drink right.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 7, 2020~The most unprofessional experience I've had with the baristas compared to any Starbucks ever
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 6, 2020~I want to start by saying I absolutely love Starbucks and spend too much of my money there and too often. With that said, this visit was the absolute worst because the girl in the drive thru, Emily, was a nightmare. She was rude from our very first encounter at the speaker, as in I pulled up and when she spoke, you could tell she wasn't in a good mood. After every drink, she would very rudely ask `"is that all`" like I had just interrupted her from doing something. I admit it was a large order, 7 drinks and a pumpkin bread, but her job isn't to judge the orders, just to take them. Plus, a good employee encourages customers to spend more money, not scare them away with rudeness. At the end of my order, she gave me the total but I realized I'd forgotten a drink so I let her know `"hey, I'm sorry but I forgot a drink.`" Her response was `"so you're adding ANOTHER drink`" in an extremely frustrated tone, like I'd just asked her to hand over her paycheck to me. Bottom line, Emily was very rude and needs to be trained in proper customer service. I've been in the restaurant/food/beverage industry my entire working life so 13 years now and I know customers can be annoying but that's no excuse for this girl Emily. I wasn't being one of those annoying customers...I wasn't being rude or difficult so she had no reason to be frustrated with me right off the bat. I've worked drive thru's before...in fact I worked in the same building when it was a Burger King. I've dealt with my fair share of difficult customers but I've never been so rude to a customer in my entire career. Working in sit down restaurants, I've had to take care of difficult customers from beginning to end, so a good hour at least, and I still never treated them poorly. She was just taking my order in a drive thru, only having to deal with me for a few minutes tops...I pulled up in a great mood but left with a sour taste in my mouth all because of this girl Emily. She needs more training in her customer service skills, her upselling skills and her basic human decency skills. That or she needs to work in a position away from customers or at a job that doesn't have customers. I don't think I'll be going back...at least not to this location. There's 3 other locations close by with much more caring employees who actually seem to like their jobs or at least know how to pretend.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~5 years ago~This is My Headquarters for all my meetings.I know all the Baristas by their first Names.Their NEW MANAGER, , Taylor Alviar , is a 10in all Areas. Her team is well versed in providing Professionally Customer Service. Taylor listens to her Teammates as well as her Clientele! The outcome is consistent return visit by Customers just like me. I am a Loyal Starbucks Customer . The store is always A+ Clean and well stocked with Promotions and CupsFor me , Th his is My FAVORITE STARBUCKS location In all of Phoenix and Scottsdale
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~May 2, 2022~I just went to this Starbucks knowing they were about to close and I believe the baristas name is alexTDs anyway I just wanted to ask if she knew where there was another location that was open and she just looked livid super rude and horrible customer service she might need a hobby or something because as much as Starbucks Pays she just looked pissed off that she had to close and she was giving BROKE vibes lol
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Dec 4, 2024~Tried a few new items. Did not care for the new summer berry refresher though. It tasted like lightly Flavored water. The boba had no taste also. But really enjoyed the pineapple cloud cake. Soft, fresh and topped with pineapples and cream, this was a good pastry.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~May 15, 2024~RUDEI am finally leaving a review after multiple encounters with the most unfriendly barista (Alexa) I have ever come in contact with. (Made sure to look at her name tag this time) The first time I thought, oh maybe she's having a bad day.... But I see now that she is just not meant to be around humans. It must take a lot of energy to be so unfriendly. The second I pull up to the drive thru and hear the unenthusiastic voice... it's just... so negative. The best way to describe it is as if we are ANNOYING her and bothering her by being customers. Never out of all the Starbucks and how I often I go have I come across someone like this.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jul 9, 2024~As a 40 year Starbucks customer, originally from Seattle, and gold card holder for 10 years, the few times I've been to this location, the same (female) evening manager insists on ignoring customers (making them/me wait unnecessarily), being rude, including arguing with me about the gold card refill perk.Today was my last visit to this location, ever.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Apr 12, 2024~This is a newer Starbucks well located at the corner of Thunderbird and 7th st. The staff is very courteous and professional. The drive thru is very busy. There's some nice outdoor seating and longer than average hours. I rank this an A Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Sep 30, 2021~I stopped here for the first time to get some coffee real quick. I got me a Ice Green Tea Sweetened since it was noon and 95 degrees 2 weeks ago. Nice staff and great neighborhood Starbucks to chill and have a drink. Nice atmosphere, Id visit again.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Jun 14, 2023~I hesitate coming here in the mornings their is this one barista who says nothing other than the total , she seems rude and bad vibe. She literally hands you your drink and looks away into the window inside.   I understand they are busy not everyone will receive a goodbye but tucking yourself inside to avoid eye contact is weird. (Their is actually a review below  of a barista with light brown hair and glasses ) who fits the description. Girl needs a new job if this is her.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~May 15, 2024~I'm not much of a review writer, but I just had to give a shout-out to this Starbucks, as I am very impressed with the quality of staff and the top-notch customer service.  Oh, and the coffee is good too.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Sep 14, 2023~The baristas and manager in the evening shift today 3/5/24 were very very rude. Upon ordering they were rushing me to take my order. When I pulled up the window to pay for my items. 2/4 items were incorrect. I had ordered 2 coffee frappes with whipped cream. I know the coffee frappes don't come with whipped cream so I ask upon ordering my drinks for it to be added. When I got my drinks they had caramel syrup on the whipped cream and the baristas and manager argued with me stating that the coffee frappe comes with whipped cream and caramel syrup and they do not on the Starbucks website. They took the drinks back and made new ones and once  again they were wrong. They had no whipped cream even though I had asked for it a second time.They were so rude about the whole situation and I am very upset. The manager is supposed to be professional and she was the rudest of them all. She was shoving the frappes in my face with a disrespectful tone saying if there is anything else they could do for me. I felt discriminated and I visit this Starbucks frequently and I'm not planning to come back.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~5 years ago~I guess friendly but I don't need a lecture with my coffee. I got a pup cup for my dog that had so much whip falling off the sides. When I asked for a little more cream that lectured me on they would need to charge me, for a splash. She said she would let it slide this time &amp; handed me my coffee back filled to the top (way more than I asked for) so now my coffee is all cream. Who likes a splash of coffee in their cream? At least now I know why she charges extra, she dumps the creamer in. I never knew making a simple request could be so hard to comprehend. I look forward to my coffee drink &amp; even more so my regular Starbucks crew on 16th st &amp; Bethany home who always make my mornings.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Sep 15, 2022~Made my day extra special this morning! I have various locations I drive thru and this morning I found a happy fun inspiring little message on my delicious London Fog latte!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Nov 10, 2020~the Starbucks is never open. Every time I come here I want to get myself a nice big caramel frappuccino because that's one of my favorite things to drink. Also my four year old son absolutely loves drinking this as well and it brings him so much joy. Only to drive 20 miles to this Starbucks to find it close. There's always a big sign in front of the store that says it's not open. I do not understand
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Jan 29, 2022~First time at this location. We're from Marana AZ visiting for the weekend. Very nice location to our resort. The Starbucks located there won't take our cards. Bret was very nice and personable.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 19, 2021~YALL I DONT WRITE REVIEWS OK!! but this Starbucks has just got it going on! The line may seem scary upon arrival but you're literally to the front of the line so fast and efficiently that it's literally never really a wait. The staff here are just so cool, friendly and FAST!! I just think they deserve recognition today! Thanks for making life a little easier!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Sep 12, 2023~This is the new location, behind the stripmall where the old, smaller Starbucks used to live.  This new building has a drive-through window, lots of parking, soaring ceilings, floor to ceiling windows, concrete floors.... this is starting to sound like a real estate listing, but the atmosphere is surely worth mentioning because you'll feel like you're in Seattle or Brooklyn when you arrive.  It's super trendy and upscale, almost elevating the neighborhood it currently sits in.  Perhaps a harbinger of more renovations to come...There's a communal sized table, bar stools and ducts... plenty of duct work for those who like that loft look.Service is good.  Drive through is crowded unfortuneately.  This was a welcome upgrade to this old-school neighborhood.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Nov 6, 2020~This is a new location and it's gorgeous inside.  NY or Seattle loft-like feel with exposed ducts and high ceilings.  Great atmo.  Drive through (huge improvement on the prior location in the adjacent strip mall).Yes, service was a little chaotic and lackluster but in fairness, it's crazy busy at this hipster location now that it's opened.  People in this area were dying for a decent Starbucks and the prior one in aforementioned stripmall was run down.Close to North Mountain park.  Easy access for those crossing town on Cactus.  Nice upscale place for the area.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Apr 15, 2018~I rarely write review but this girl was beyond rude to me for no reason to my shyness I rarely talk but she took it personal. Girlie pop with light brown with a ponytail and glasses. I don't understand why she was so rude. I said thank you for my drink &amp; she say your not welcome because I'm shy. Girl bye.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 4, 2023~We visited on Christmas morning.  The store was beautifully decorated. There was holiday music playing at a nice level which added to the festive ambiance.  The staff were all dressed in festive attire and were so friendly.  Our drinks tasted great and were made quickly from scratch.  This was a great way to spend Christmas morning!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Dec 25, 2019~The SLOWEST Starbucks drive through I've ever been in, and there were not that many cars in line. Most of the staff inside were moving in slow motion and looked miserable (when I finally got up to the window, I noticed)
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 6, 2022~The service is to die for. They are always nice and interactive. They will make you feel welcome. One particular barista was Shayne, he is the definition of perfect.. Friendly, patient and informative. Had me try my drink since it was new before I left and that's super convenient.
break
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~5 years ago~There is literally a Starbucks on every corner in N Phx. It's a blessing and a curse. Always good for a coffee on the go, all these drive throughs are game changers. I'd recommend going to C Phx or downtown to drink coffee, chill, and support local
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Dec 10, 2020~I never leave reviews but the way the barista preparing our mobile order treated us I had to. The manager of this store needs to speak to the employees about how you treat a customer. We will never ever come back to this location after this experience!!! So rude you don't treat people like that ever. She made my drink wrong and when I asked to fix it she got mad and said she has other drinks to make.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Sep 11, 2021~My friend and I came here after hiking on north mountain. Building was clean, staff friendly and efficient, several chairs and tables, and plenty of parking. Would come here again as they were great.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 30, 2019~This is for the 7th street and thunderbird location . They are so awesome ! They always know your name and greet everyone with a smile ! If things aren't right they fix it immediately !They even know both of my dogs names and always offer pup cups when I do a walk in order ! Love these group of people !
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Sep 16, 2020~I come here everyday. I actually spend 100$s at this store believe it or not. Today I'm on an important call with my mother. I run to get my coffee should take all of two minutes but instead. I grab this cup of milk pictured here. I have to hang up go back in and ask what's up. Takes about five minutes of...the manager to yell at me that I'm wrong for asking why my coffee looks like this. The barista continues to tell me that they give an 2 shots in each coffee they serve you no matter the size they just add more milk.. and more ice... so it's just looks weird... so ripping people off?! Essentially?! You give people the same amount of coffee in every size and more milk and ice so what you're telling me is IM GETTING RIPPED OFF?! And I'm stupid for asking about 5$ coffee that has NOTHING BUT MILK... Yeah I will never be coming back. Thank you for the gentlemen who remade it and asked if it that was right. Yes, I finally got coffee. If I wanted a cup of milk I would have bought a jug of Milk! Which is five dollars! I paid for coffee... customer service tip the customer is always right... I literally can tell visibility here this isn't right! So you just lost on a thousand dollars a year customer. Cause I drink coffee from here everyday... light ice or not still three shots in a venti end of story.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~May 21, 2020~Newly opened Starbucks on the corner of 7th and Thunderbird. This spot offers a large parking lot and a drive-thru which their last location didn't have. Same hours and same menu from their last spot, but this place is open and have plenty of seating both indoors and out for those that want to just sit and relax while having their tea or coffee.On the occasion that I came, I think they had just been in their new location for about a week. They were still training the new staff, but they worked quickly and efficiently to take and fill my order. The guy at the register was very friendly and answered questions I had with knowledge about a new drink. He spoke clearly and actually looked me in the eyes while speaking with me.Drink came out quickly and tasted just how I like it. No complaints here. Store was clean and organized. Sugar and cream was filled. Tables wiped down and floors swept. Will come back to this location again.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Oct 5, 2017~My drink was made with more of one ingredient. Looked nothing like what my order usually looks like. They were kind enough to remake. But when I tried to tell them how I liked it they didn't listen to what I was saying and added more of the ingredient that I asked less for and told me that's what they did. I will not be coming to this location again...
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Nov 10, 2022~I rarely write bad reviews but I felt the need to do so this time . I usually go to another Starbucks but on Monday (6-24) my boyfriend and I came here . There was one car behind us and one car in front of us . When we were ordering we felt so rushed and we felt like the girl was kind of rude . We got our drinks and they were fine done e didn't think too much about it because everyone has some off days . The next day Tuesday (6-25) at around 6 am we came here again . Once again a different girl , named Lisa rushed us on the radio and when we got to the window she had our order wrong . We had asked for my drink in a reusable cup . The first thing she asked for my reusable cup . My boyfriend kindly told her `" oh no she wanted hers in a reusable cup , we want to buy one `" to where she said `" Oh that's different you're gonna have to wait a minute then `" .. looking very bothered . We kind of just looked at each other and shook our heads but we just sat there and waited. Then she opened the window and told us the price. As my boyfriend handed her his gold card he said `" I have a free reward and can you reload it with $15.`" She said ok and closed the window. Next thing we know some guy named named Ross came to the window and said `" For future references , if you have a free reward you need to tell us before we reload the card .`" We just said ok then laughed because we did tell them at the same time and so we figured that Lisa probably did the transaction wrong . Finally we ask for a cup of ice water ( before they even handed us our last drink) and Lisa says `" Next time you have all these requests can you just come inside.`" I couldn't believe it . I am an everyday Starbucks drinking and this is the first time this has every happened . I never have `" sooo many request `" and it's never a big deal for some water . I have never been treated so rudely. If it had been my fault I would not be writing this but not only were most of the issues their fault but then they tried to blame us like it was our fault . Even if it had been my fault ... CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT . I've worked in customer service for a long time . I get we all have bad days but do not take it out on your customers . Safe to say I will NOT be back to this location again .
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jun 26, 2019~Leaving the store just now. Frustrated and very disappointed. The mobile order that I placed was not ready when I came. Barista tells me that the sticker was not issued. I could not refresh my feed in the store in the app, so I couldn't prove that I actually ordered it. She offered it to make one but then got pissy with me about doing me a favor. I'm driving away to the next store on the third third Street and Bell Road where they have way better service. And sure enough the order just showed up in the app. Barista on 3st/bell made it. Every time I come to 7/TBitd there is an issue of some sort - unpleasant if not rude employees etc.  if you can drive to 3/Bell- please do, way better experience! Will be calling Starbucks. Unbelievable
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Apr 27, 2021~Let me just say that I love Starbucks. But this location is horrible. My husband and I get Starbucks from this location a few times a week for atleast the past year. I have turned a blind eye to drinks being made incorrectly (ordered a frappuccino but got the hot version) and lack of food items but will no longer continue to go to this location after my last experience.  My drink was so hot that it actually scalded my mouth badly. I've been drinking coffee for many years...I've was even a barista for 3 years and this drink was too hot to safely serve. Won't be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~5 years ago~Just came to order Starbucks, barista was very rude, had an attitude and must have been in a bad mood. We ended up cancelling our order and leaving due to her demeanor.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 31, 2021~This has got to be the slowest walkup service I have ever had at a Starbucks.  I would recommend going to another place
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Apr 14, 2022~THE WORST STARBUCKS IN THE VALLEY. they are extremely incompetent for one and then have an attitude on top of their incompetency. First off the drive-through is a nightmare because the soundboard is facing seventh Street and they can never hear what the fuck you're saying so then you try to go inside to prevent that issue and just nothing is flowing correctly and no one seems to know what's going on. I spend $150 a month at Starbucks through multiple locations and this is by far the worst spot.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Oct 22, 2018~First time here.  I went at 6 am and there was nobody there, no lines. I went thru the drive thru.  I didn't look or drink until I got home.  They gave me half a cup of coffee, I am not stretching the truth and I don't mean an inch or two from the top. I'll try to post pics. I looked up the phone number on Google and it is someone's cell number and they didn't answer, probably too many complaints.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~May 5, 2019~This is the best Starbucks ever. I have been going here consistently since the pandemic started and can attest to the quality and reliability, as well as the incredible friendliness, of this Starbucks team.  Sometimes, they even provide us with personalized notes or stickers to make the day a little brighter. I feel badly that I order through Uber eats instead of directly with them, but I plan to provide them with my patronage when I do go in person more! Although, let's be honest- What's better than a steaming hot macchiato delivered right to your door?? Not much when youre teleworking and the world is on fire. THANK YOU, Starbucks in 7th/T-bird, for bringing `"Uber eats Zach and Erin`" happiness these past several months! We adore you!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Aug 25, 2020~Came here on a cold night to get a warm drink because the location at 19th and Bell was temporarily closed.  Pulled into the drive thru at 8:01 and was told they could not help me.  2 different Starbucks within 10 minutes, and got zero service.  Terrible service.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Mar 4, 2022~Starbucks was great! Uber Eats service was horrible!Starbucks had their order on time and Bray was Great but I would Highly recommend NOT use Uber Eats!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 1, 2021~My daughter and I always do mobile order. This is the first time we used this location. Unfortunately they got the orders wrong  We did not have time to get them corrected but how hard is it to do SOY milk and light ice. We got both drinks with coconut milk and extra ice. The stickers on the cups were correct but the actual order was wrong. And of course I was charged for the SOY. We will NOT be using this location again.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 6, 2020~I have never had to write a bad review about a coffee shop, especially Starbucks, however I have given this location the benefit of the doubt since it is the closest to where I live, only to be disappointed yet again. The employees at this location have proved to me 5 times that they have selective hearing. Super simple drink, screwed up 5 times in a week. Usually I am in a rush and don't have the time to bring it to their attention, however today I had the time. I let the barista know that my simple beverage should have cream in it... she literally poured HALF of my drink out in front of me, and doused it in cream. Never mind the fact I paid extra to add an extra shot of espresso, and flavoring... half of it went down the drain. Then when I ask it to be made correctly, the cashier rings up the order incorrect, again. Consistency is key in my mind. If I order a drink at one location, it should be the same at every location... not the case at this store. Save yourself the frustration and just go elsewhere for your coffee needs as this store is a waste of money, time and energy.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Mar 17, 2021~Clean, efficient and friendly staff, this location has no problem making keto/special dietary consideration coffees and teas. It's been tough to find a location that suggest low or no carb options, but this one's got it. Drive up is available too.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~5 years ago~I come here at least 3x a week but I want to say that yesterday June 3rd I came up here after the worst day ever, my mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and helping her through the pain and the frustration has honestly been more than I can bare and trying to put on a brave face while working is tough. I came here to get my usual egg sandwich and a tea but realized I left my wallet at work and could barely pay for the sandwich, the nice lady at the drive through said it was fine and gave me the tea anyway. I don't know her name but I just want her to know that small act of kindness had been the best thing that had happened to me all day and I actually cried over it while driving back to work. Thank you so much whoever you are, I hope that you see this.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Jun 4, 2019~this location is alright sometimes, but most of the times I come they either don't have an ingredient or a drink that I want, there was one time I ordered a hot medicine ball and the guy gave it to me but it didn't have one of those stopper thing you put on the hole, so when I took it and drove away a it burned my hand, I was very agitated.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Sep 19, 2021~This is a cute Starbucks, nice staff, pretty speedy service. They have a tiny patio area and it's basically just the sidewalk in front of the store.It was very busy when I went but it was raining for once in phoenix. The service was speedy and though it was packed, still friendly. I know I'm repeating myself but I have no patience when it comes to slow baristas. There was a lot of space in the shared lot to park and lots of seating available inside even considering the large crowd hiding from the rain.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Apr 27, 2014~Slowest Starbucks I've ever in my entire life been! Every morning I have to go out of my way to another Starbucks because this one is on my way but I wait at least 15 minutes in line every single time! They either need to pay to have more staff and get rid of the big profit margin... Or they need to fire who they have an actually get people that work
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Feb 15, 2020~Meh. This was odd experience. I attended this location with my mother about 730 am, and we are greeted  by a kind woman named Emily who worked the cashier. We ordered blonde brew coffee with soy milk, as well as a dragonfruit refresher along its an order of eggs and a croissant, we proceeded to the patio and my mom received her coffee, removed the lid to put in sugar and the milk had curdled. She was immediately turned off and asked that I take it back and just get her an iced tea, i returned to Emily and she told me they change the milfs every 20 mins and then read me my total for the venti iced tea... i look down at the full cup of curdled coffee  and she says I'll pour it out. I said okay paid for the 3rd drink. Starbucks treatment of people needs to be better.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jun 3, 2019~My most favorite Starbucks! The baristas are amazing. They go above and beyond to make sure I'm taken care of. I love the new store!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Nov 22, 2017~Utter chaos... Six people working behind the counter, half of them assigned to the drive-through alone. The one register worker frequently left the register to fix food orders rather than take the remaining orders from people standing in line.There were several people ahead of me in line when I walked in. Each one of them had a major issue with their order.Starbucks might want to have a talk with the store manager and get their processes a little more rehearsed.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 7, 2018~Poor customer service. Drink was horrible. Taste like I am drinking a glass of milk since they decided to put my grande drink in a venti cup to make up their lack of attention. Took my order at the screen and then had to repeat it all at the window.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Apr 3, 2021~This store is amazing! The baristas are friendly, always smiling, and make me and my kids feel so welcome. Even if there is a mistake made, they're always quick to make it right!I never go anywhere else!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Sep 6, 2018~This is my favorite Starbucks! I've been to so many starbucks in Arizona, more than 15, but this one is the best. They always make my drink exactly how I want it, it's always consistent, the attitudes of the employees is awesome. The coffee never tastes burnt or old, my espresso shots never taste dead. The wait is never long! Thank you for being exactly what i need from a coffee shop!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~5 years ago~Good Starbucks. Staff rocks. Lots of outlets for power if you need it. Only problem is it's always so cold in there. Seriously, coldest building I've ever hung out in. Bring a sweatshirt!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Dec 8, 2019~Educate your baristas on coffee... My girlfriend went on a coffee run and asks me if I want something. I tell her I wanted a tall cafe au lait. I said it is probably called a misto here in Arizona. (In the south it is cafe au lait.) SOOOOOOOO simple. Coffee with steamed milk. That's it. The barista didn't know what misto was, didn't know what cafe au lait was. Even after an explanation was super confused. Says, `"Oh that's a latte.`" ARGH. No... It's not. Don't want the caffeine blast of espresso shots. Regular coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 13, 2016~Best Starbucks around. The evening staff are above and beyond awesome. When I go in there, I feel like I'm stepping in to Cheers. They all know my name, what I order and ask about my family, my business, my basketball injuries.Tip them well and they'll take really good care of you!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Mar 9, 2011~I came with my 6-year-old nephew today on a coffee run &amp; we were asked to leave (after we had already ordered) because he forgot his shoes. Really? A 6-year-old forget his shoes on a quick coffee run down the street from our house and you ask us to leave the building??!!! This is totally unaccommadating for families!!! Not to mention we had already paid &amp; we had to wait an inordinate amount of time to order! I am not coming back especially with my family and kids.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 19, 2018~Love this location!! It's brand new so it's very nice! The customer service is great, everyone is so sweet and so convenient since it has a drive through! Definitely loving that we have a closer Starbucks (since I'm addicted). We visit this location very often, love it!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 7, 2018~I've been to this Starbucks a few times and each time have been very disappointed. Today was the last time I will go to this location. I asked for a white chocolate mocha and got something that looked like iced milk. I told the guy at the window it was the wrong drink and he didn't even want to hear it. He said no it's not but already late to my location, I just took the drink and left. Also, as you can see the drink isn't even labeled.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jan 1, 2019~Another great review for this Starbuck's. I would like to recognize Petros. He always gets my order right, and he is very friendly. It doesn't matter how busy he is, he will take the time to say hi. I like to come to this Starbuck's whenever possible. Matty and Melissa are great too. And of course Dallas. Dallas is great with my adult son who has autism.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Nov 13, 2017~Boyant is a great employee!! He is always in a great mood when I'm there, and my order is always correct!! One day I came first thing in the morning, and we waited outside until the manager came. Boyant kept apologizing and kept us in a good mood while we waited. This is my favorite Starbucks, and even though the new store is opening next week with a drive thru, I will still go inside just to visit with the staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Sep 15, 2017~This is my favorite Starbucks!! My two favorite employees are Dallas and Melissa!! They know what I like, and know me by name. Everyone is nice, but these two go above and beyond!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Aug 28, 2017~Not sure when they moved to this newer building. Busy location with a drive thru. Used mobile order to place my order about 5 minutes before I arrived. My order was waiting for me despite being fairly crowded. Nice outside seating and large parking area. Easy access.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Feb 25, 2018~Just saying, I frequent many Starbucks throughout the valley and don't bother using mobile order at this location. They took much longer to get those orders out than other locations. I will say that their black iced tea tastes better than other locations so they've got going for them.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Feb 10, 2018~This location needs to learn the menu.  We were charged $1.00 more for our regular order than normal and then.... the drinks were not right!    The gal at the window handed us the first drink which was overfilled and told us to be careful because it was all over the top and outside of cup.  She didn't offer a napkin or anything.  I will not return to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~5 years ago~SERIOUSLY. The last time I was here I ordered at the counter and it took eons. And the staff was less than impressive with their guest service. This time, I ordered with the App and arrived 15 minutes after ordering to find that my drink still wasn't done. (The app guessed a 4-7 minute order) I definitely get the `"No time? No wait`" promise with the app.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Mar 25, 2016~S L O W. Only two people working this afternoon. Maybe a one time fluke? There was a self proclaimed new hire working the register and someone else making drinks. The latter was very mean. She mocked the new hire in front of guests (who encouraged it with laughter). I don't know. I was really uncomfortable with the way she spoke down to her coworker. Anyway. There we're three people in line and it took me like 20 minutes to get my drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~Mar 15, 2016~Nice and new Starbucks but there WiFi sucks. can't listen to online lectures here cause they keep cutting out or buffering. I like the atmosphere though.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Nov 4, 2017~My local Starbucks always call in her for frappacino and they always he fast and friendly service.Only downfall no drive through
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Mar 24, 2016~This a the typical, poorly run Corp store.  Inattentive and disappointing accuracy in filling orders   I go to the Safeway and get wonderful personal service from Espy and teammates. Better managers and training are needed at this amateur run joint.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Aug 9, 2020~When I have to go to Starbucks (and because of my girlfriend's Caramel Machiatto with too many shot addiction i often do) this is the one that pisses me off the least. I have had a string of bad luck with service and drinks at other locations but the people working at this location really have their shit together. The espresso is hardly ever even burned! Almost everyone who works here is sweet as daisies and they even occassionally let me out with my black coffee for free. The location is generally quiet and well behaved as far as patrons go so I don't even mind hanging out for a bit to work on my crosswords.This location does a great job of reminding me that Starbucks was once a neighborhood coffee house with good business values.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Apr 28, 2008~This is my neighborhood Starbucks. Let's face it: Starbucks is the fast food of coffee. You are looking for consistency and efficiency and you get it here. Even when the line stretches to the door the staff are smiling and friendly, moving through the orders as quickly as they can. And, despite the criticism that they're `"corporate,`" those barristas know my name (and my drink), even when I don't remember theirs! If I've been on a roll and coming in daily, they are courteous enough to start my drink even before I get to the register. When it's been a while, they remember my drink but check to make sure that's what I'm in the mood for on that visit. They have started a rewards program where you can get a free drink for every 15 transactions or with a whole bean purchase, free refills on brewed coffee and tea and they won't charge you for (select) syrups and `"milks.`" Plus you get a free drink for your birthday. Another perk: I have Starbucks to thank for a lot of the more recent downloads on my iPod, thanks to the Pick of the Week. I grab one of those cards by the register whenever a new one is out and redeem the free download and I really have `"discovered`" new artists.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Dec 16, 2010~This is my favorite Starbucks by far. Every barista here is awesome. Always friendly, know my drink, drink is always correct
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jan 29, 2015~If I could give this store 0 starts I would. The baristas were very rude and kept giving dirty looks in the drive thru window. I will never come to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~May 8, 2020~Another large Starbucks location with tables aplenty!  The weather is perfect now mid-day and the hipsters are out.  Pros of this location:Cranberry cheesecake-desserty thing samples on the counterThey spelled `"Erin`" correctly, and normally.Cons of this location:I can't find any outlets! Perhaps that's why all the chairs in the corner are full?  Good thing I charged up at the last spot, which had outlets below all of the tables that I looked at.This one, too, is a little chilly.  It's November in Phoenix so naturally half of us are bundled up in sweaters (albiet flip flops) and the other half are in sundresses and short pants, but I thin it's cold for all of us here. I can see goosebumps on my fellow caffeine fiends.The pros outweigh the cons and the ladies behind the counter are lovely and light-hearted, so I'm a fan.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Nov 15, 2014~This is the closest Starbucks to the Pointe Tapatio Cliffs.  Keep that in mind because if you ever stay there you will not be able to find any kind of coffee after 11:00 AM.  That's another review.This Starbucks kept us going morning, noon and night during a visit.  They never messed up our order, had fresh pastries every day and everyone was quite friendly.  The only reason it's four instead of five stars is, well, it's still Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~3~5 years ago~So I'm a coffee fan through and through, and Starbucks to be sure is near the top my list usually. While this Starbucks is fine, staff service seems to be lacking. Service is make a break, and unfortunately it's not making the grade today.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Feb 27, 2012~This is the worst coffee shop I have ever been in. Terrible service long lines and more. very dissatisfied
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jun 17, 2018~The staff at this location has ZERO sense of urgency. It drives me crazy! Be prepared to wait in a long line and cross your fingers they get your order right when you've waited 10 minutes to get a coffee. I would offer this advice for such a popular location... Have someone taking orders of customers waiting in line! Every morning you have a line that expands all the way to the front door. This location would be ideal if management spent some time with their staff on time management.Wake up Starbucks! Let's get going!!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Nov 26, 2013~Best Starbucks  Ive been coming here since it opened and I've never had a bad experience! All the Barristas are so nice and very friendly and helpful! I love the convenience of the drive thru. Recommend for sure and I will keep going back!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Mar 28, 2018~This Starbucks... oh my goodness! Whoever was taking drive thru orders today 12/1/2018 was quite possibly the nicest human I've ever encountered. He was so sweet and well spoken, helpful, and make something as typical as ordering a coffee SO lovely!!! He even helped me pick out a new breakfast item from the menu when I didn't know what I wanted. He made my morning. I wish I knew his name so that I could write to the company and sing his praises.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Dec 1, 2018~Usually i am very respectful of times and simply just nice with service workers. but i sat in that drive-thru line for 15 mins only 10 mins after 8pm when they said they close at 9pm. The worker was leaving in his car the store and closing the store when i finally gave up and drove out of the drive-thru. Are you kidding me :/ they weren't even closed yet!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Aug 27, 2019~I usually come to this Starbucks And they always Make my order right. But today was the worst experience I went through the drive through To order 3 drinks and they took like 20 minutes to give us the drinks and there was only 2 cars in front of us. When we got to the window they took another 5 minutes And the girl didn't apologize For making us wait so long and she also forgot To give us 1 of our drinks so we had to tell her. She looked new but she still should of apologized .
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Jul 9, 2019~This location has plenty of parking and seats available inside even on a crowded day.  There is not a lot of outdoor space, only a small patio on the side that's part of a sidewalk.  Staff was friendly, but service can be a bit slow.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Dec 1, 2015~Usually a line but not too bad.Service good as is the selections of pastry &amp; coffee.Heard they were taking over the corner behind them where Shell gas station was but seems to be on hold.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Nov 18, 2016~Nice Starbucks to hang out for a little while. There's even a community library in the back with lots of books including children's stuff. Friendly service and in addition to the regular pastry and sandwich offerings, they have Vosges chocolate here (yum).
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~5 years ago~Never been to a worse Starbucks.  Went to the drive thru and Kim was rude and unfriendly. She was more concerned with continuing the conversation with her coworker. No sense of urgency unlike the other locations I've been to.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 10, 2014~They always make drinks correctly, it's almost always clean (even when they are busy), and they are always very professional.  And they take care of people who love coffee.  I once asked what they had brewed and it wasn't dark enough roast/too acidic for my stomach.  One of the baristas made me an amazing cup of the Italian blend with a press.  It was wonderful.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Dec 15, 2016~Total chaos (even for a starbucks).  The unfriendliest staff. Can't even say sorry when they make a mistake
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Mar 31, 2018~The staff is always very friendly.   I love the iced green tea!  Always ask them to not add water.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jun 28, 2016~Been here a few times and the baristas are always very nice and super quick with your order. Place is also really clean. Will always come back given the chance.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Jul 4, 2015~Plenty of tables and windows. The corner location offers w nice view. It's always populated and the crew is friendly and fast. The plaza is easy to access and the parking is not bad at all. It's clean. Good coffee and fresh pastries.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Jul 8, 2015~This place needs to get their stuff together.    I should not have to tell them that blueberry oatmeal needs blueberry and water.     Not busy so that is not an excuse.   Then the guy put cold water in ... still waiting to eat that.  Smh
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Aug 13, 2017~The girls here are always cheerful and make a great mocha frap no whip with drizz. The positive energy and expertise there with the level of foot traffic, deserves the kudos. Thank you STRBKX and Kudos for training and selecting the best.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~May 1, 2016~Have been there twice for the cranberry bliss and both times have been out . How can that be ? It is a seasonal product . The lady was rude about it as well
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 13, 2017~ best starbucks around &amp; probably one of the best i've ever been too... &amp; i'm not just saying that because i work there, but it really has a great atmosphere, huge lobby to come study or just hangout, &amp; the drinks are always good. :]
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~5 years ago~The new store needs a huge lesson on customer service! If there is 6 people behind the counter and you have to stand at the counter for more then 4-5 minutes with not one person saying `"hello`" or `"hi I will be with you shortly`" nothing! Just walk past you 5 times with no words. Twice now I have a experience that in the last week. I understand you are busy in the drive thru but a simple greeting or acknowledgment would make it a whole lot easier to wait 5 minutes before you are helped.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Oct 3, 2017~All Starbucks are not created equal. This location is good. Staff very friendly and helpful and the coffee was good!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 8, 2013~Great staff! They are so genuine and treat you like a person, not another transaction. This is what coffee shops are all about. In a rush? Brew at home or wake up earlier.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Feb 13, 2014~Wonderful staff, great positive atmosphere!  Service was quick and product was perfection!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Feb 6, 2014~Don't judge a book by it's cover! I recently started coming here and from the outside it looks small and corner-ish; almost like a diver bar. However as soon as you walk in the door you feel as if you have walked into a Costo. I could almost play basketball in the store. The spaciousness is really important to me and you can pick a good seat and survey the entire store. The wall strip of never ending outlets to plug in whatever electronic device is more than useful. The staff are all really affable and cater to your specific needs. Def a great local to read, study, or just get some work done!
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Aug 21, 2014~This is a pretty neat starbucks location. It is well kept, clean, clean bathrooms, and good service. They have yet to mess up a coffee order for me and my co workers. The coffee is consistently pretty good, and the place is quiet if you want to relax and read.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~2~Aug 5, 2015~What's happened here. `"Do you have a blonde roast?`" `"No, all we have is Pike.`" At this point you're usually asked if you're willing to wait while they do a pour over or an Americana...not this barista. Got my `"Pike`" and headed for the napkins...empty. `"Do you have any napkins?`" `"No, we're out.`" .... Not up to standards this particular evening.....
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Jan 25, 2017~This is a great Starbucks! Their service is always fast and my order always accurate. The baristas are very friendly, Cody especially! I try to get to this Starbucks as often as I can.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~5~Dec 3, 2015~A great safe place my junior goes there for study time with her friends and they even brought in a pizza! They are quick and accurate and nice
Phoenix, AZ 85022~4~Sep 21, 2015~Always friendly, fast service, plenty of tables to relax both inside and out. Great location,  easy in easy out, it could only get better if it had a drive-thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~5 years ago~HORRIBLE! First let me say, I have made friends with almost everyone at 19th and tbird and 31st and Peoria and have most of them as friends on fb so I know it's not me. I have been to this location many times and never really had an issue.. Until today. I had asked if she could make my sandwich after our drinks were made so it would be hot. So of course she put it in first and then placed our drink order. I just brushed it off thinking that she'll make our drinks since no one else was in line but she just stood there until a line formed taking their orders. The supervisor Cheri  (she's the blonde chick who's style is kind of like a pin up) comes out from the back, sees the line and us, and leaves again. Now I'm getting a little annoyed. She finally comes back and starts throwing lids and things around and you can feel the negative energy. I remember this chick from before and she's always had a bad attitude. We finally get our drinks and I just let the barista know that I had wanted my sandwich made after but didn't make a huge deal out of it. That's when Cheri decides it's finally time to release all of that obvious anger she's been holding in and starts talking shit. I don't say anything and we leave. She is a very rude person and I know her type(works in customer service but doesn't want to drop her attitude). I know I can't be the only one who's noticed (ie other customers and I'm sure employees/corporate). She needs an attitude adjustment. Working customer service you do not act like that.
Phoenix, AZ 85022~1~Aug 28, 2016~I normally love this Starbucks and would probably rate it a 4, but today's service Sunday afternoon was so shocking, I'd like to make the point with 1 star. The barista who took my order was so incredibly rude asking me to `"hurry up`" because she had customers when the place was almost empty and there was only one person behind me in the queue who was still looking and asked me to take my time.  An elderly lady in front of me had asked me a question and I was taking the time to answer. It was a beautiful Sunday and this kind of friendly talk among customers is the kind of thing that makes a Starbucks a local hangout that justifies the $4 price tag for the coffee. There was noone pressuring this barista who felt compelled to be snippy and give one liner retorts as though she had some place better to be. The place remained almost empty the remainder of the Sunday and no wonder.  Perhaps she had too much coffee, but she could really learn to chill and help create the friendly atmosphere that makes the shop a worthy Sunday destination. If the customers are cool and relaxed, what's this woman's problem?  I think I'll try LUX just 10 minutes away on Central.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Feb 7, 2024~Make my drink correctly! More than 50% of the time my drink is made wrong... The manager even told me to change my name to `"no milk`" and somehow I still get milk in my drink :-/
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jan 22, 2024~This Starbucks on 27th Ave is the best!  In Dec when they were closed for remodeling I was forced to go to another location on HV Rd and was reminded of how this place is awesome!  The friendly customer service, always getting my order correct and how streamlined they are.  Always friendly customer service, thank you for that!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jun 16, 2023~The Starbucks crew at 27th Ave., and West Agua Fria in the the target store are simply the best! They remembered my birthday. I might go in there a little too often! They all signed a card and gave me flowers. They are absolutely the best, and make me feel so loved!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Sep 23, 2023~Terrible drinks inside target Starbucks. Barista did not make any of our shaken espresso drinks correctly. I asked the barista if it was the right drink as it was too sweet and he did nothing to try and fix it. Won't be coming back here again.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~May 9, 2023~Best Target Starbucks I have ever been too. Very clean, open, great staff, fast service and made me feel like I was a local.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jul 29, 2019~Delicious drink made by the server!!! I always forget to get the names of the servers but I appreciate them a ton! She made my drink really good, I got a Venti vanilla bean frap blended with blackberry &amp; straw berry infusions! Blended with extra ice and cinnamon dolce powder, caramel drizzle in cup and then add whip and caramel on top :)Always have the best service when I come to this Starbucks location in Target, definitely my go to in the area!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 20, 2018~Yet another starbucks because of my wife. This is at best location. Next to AMC and well maintained like majority of stores. It has enough seating as well. Nice coffee next door. They do happy hour and season special drinks as well. So full fledged I would say.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Sep 14, 2020~Jess at this Starbucks was so friendly and quick! Our drinks were delicious and I appreciate the fact that she talked with my daughters along side of me, that's hard to find!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Nov 3, 2022~As an Uber eats driver I experience bad service here and there. And even at this location a couple times. But today I didn't appreciate the kind of service I got today with Kristen. Who was handling delivery orders this morning. I went in to spoke with her and told her what name I was there for. She told me it would be a few minutes. I noticed she looked at me several times as I waited on the order. The order had one drink and one food item. I waited almost 15 minutes until I finally went up to speak to Kristen about an update on the order. Her helper pointed out the order was the one and only bag that was already prepared and ready just sitting there for at least 10 minutes. When I asked Kristen if she knew the order was there the whole time and she just shrugged her shoulders and rolled her eyes. I was the African American in there and I can't help but feel racially discriminated against. I will not be coming back to deliver or pickup for this location and I will be notifying Uber as well.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Aug 10, 2019~This place needs a serious manager who knows what they are doing I walked in and first notice that the new cups are stored hard up against a trash bin. Physically touching.  So apparently they dont care much about sanitation.  Maybe the dept of health will. I dunno.  Second.  I was the only one in line.  Everyone else in there had a drink and was seated.  I ordered.  The barista made a drink.  Not mine.  Made another drink. Not mine.  Made a THIRD drink. Not mine. Mind you.  I was THE ONLY ONE THERE.   How are you making three drinks while staring at the person who just ordered and waiting for his?  Customer service isnt a thing?  We're just robots making things in senseless order?  Again I circle back to poor management failing to give its team proper direction.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 27, 2018~Simple, kind, accommodating service. Inside of a Target to deal with crazy Holiday shopping. Stephanie stayed on top of coffee rhythm. She's great and she could move like lightening.   Another pleasant holiday experience!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Dec 9, 2024~Monday morning 6 AM the barista with the long, thick brown hair needs to not have an attitude when she makes drinks wrong!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Mar 19, 2024~The staff was friendly but it was a 20 minute wait for coffee. The interior is tiny and crowded. The tables come out on arms from the wall and are really uncomfortable if you need to work while you wait. Id probably skip this location in the future.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Aug 11, 2024~I love Starbucks but NOT this one. Omg... line always takes forever. Got extremely sick from them adding the wrong milk at least twice. Rude drive through. Never again. 0 stars
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Aug 9, 2024~We just picked up our drinks from Starbucks and we are very disappointed. The curly hair girl at the window said that we needed to give more time from when we placed the order to come for pick up. Keep in mind we came after the suggested time.Also my wife's drink didn't have an ingredient she asked for and mine was not blended/ had enough ice and lacked flavor.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Sep 20, 2024~They would rather rush through drive-thru orders than make it right. This has happened multiple times to me at the location. I ordered a hot vanilla latte and got milk with a shot of coffee and syrup. They can't even take the time to steam drinks. This morning was the fifth time, and I'm just done with this place.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Feb 27, 2023~This is a drive through ONLY Starbucks that even with long lines, doesn't take a lot of time. I found myself at the end and it took about 5 minutes to get my drink. The service is kind and good. The drinks are always good.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Feb 4, 2024~I'm truly a patient person, with the exception of grabbing a coffee before work when I only have 5 minutes to spare but this Starbucks so incredibly slow. The line is always very long. The staff is very friendly though. The ambiance in the inside is nice with the updates. Two stars for that. I know good things take time but on average I'm in line for about 15+ mins. I'm writing this while waiting in line. But friendly staff! Yay there.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jul 2, 2021~We swung in here on the way home from our staycation for a potty break and a treat. It was a nice spacious clean location. My husband got his Nitro Cold Brew. The girls got their strawberry and chocolate Frappuccinos that were made perfectly and look so yummy! Service was super super friendly. The drinks were made fast. Their bathroom has a security lock code on their door. Thank goodness it was clean and had plenty of paper products including potty protectors.A great experience to end our mini stayca  in town.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~May 10, 2024~Always. Tried one of the other ones, but definitely back to starbucks, they are truly my personal assistance!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Apr 27, 2024~I don't care about waiting, which is a given when they're busy, but to go through drive thru getting a bacon gouda sandwich and then getting all the way home and it has no bacon on it.  So I return to get a new one and the girls there are snotty and not friendly at all.  Especially the one making all of the sandwiches in the oven, she does not appear to like her job at all.  No sorry, no, thank you.  Nothing.  Customer service apparently isn't their forte and I will never tip them again.   Not that they care, apparently.  If I could give less than one star, I would.  They don't care about their customers or their mistakes.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Nov 18, 2023~Waited in the drive through line for 15 minutes and they managed to serve two cars. I watched people pull out of line to walk inside for service and come back out before the line moved at all. Eventually myself and several others gave up and left. I try and avoid this location as they are usually exceptionally slow or inaccurate in drinks but today it was the most convenient choice. I could have driven to another location further away and at least gotten my drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Feb 4, 2024~Service is awful at this location. Unfortunately drinks and food aren't good quality either. Store is very empty but somehow always messy.. would recommend going to the target across the street and using their Starbucks, they have much better customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Mar 20, 2023~5 stars for the customer service, every time I come to this location they're always so friendly and nice. Not as busy as other Starbucks I've been to but even if there's a long line of cars it goes by pretty fast. I definitely would recommend this location!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Dec 7, 2019~I get it, it's a Starbucks in Deer Valley. Ton's of office buildings, thousands of workers and its the only drive-through Starbucks in the area. Despite the numerous times I have checked in here, my son goes to a specialist nearby and its the only place that has a holiday drink that I like at the moment. Why did I rate this place so low? It's because it's very and I mean very inconsistent when it comes to waiting times and drinks. I walked inside the other week thinking `"Well the drive-through is long so I guess I should go inside`" Nope... For the first time in history going inside the lobby to order your drink was much slower. When I mean much slower, it took 15 minutes to get my drink. The few times I been here they always forget to add flavor to my drink so I get a blank Almond milk iced blonde latte instead of vanilla or chestnut praline (first world problems right) They do have a table with coloring books if your coming with your kid...or if you need something to do while waiting the 20 minutes it takes for your coffee. I only gave this place 2 stars because the one lady who works the drive-through (the older blonde lady) is the nicest and most caring worker there. The other week I had one worker give me an attitude cause she thought my name was `"Arkada`" instead of Arlina and accused me of trying to take my own drink. When I told her exactly the customization was in the drink was when she decided to hand it over and guess what...it was still wrong. If you don't need a blonde roast and you work in this area, your better off going inside the Starbucks in Target. If your near Happy Valley Road, just go to the Starbucks there.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jul 6, 2021~Tuesday, July 6, 2021 @ 5:30pm Attention District Manager:Why is this a service challenged location? You had 5 employees working &amp; no one wanted to acknowledge us standing in line - why?
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Oct 22, 2023~Customer service is excellent:) My order is a bit complicated due to my allergies and they nail it every time and put love into their drinks. Never had issues, they manage to get the line moving and still provide good drinks in a timely manner. Great management.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Jan 3, 2023~Service is fine people are nice and definitely keep things moving.  But CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN why I wait 10 min for a drip coffee.  Back in the day (10 months ago in this case) they would turn around and put coffee in a cup and 45 seconds I was on my way.  Seriously what the serious F!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Nov 24, 2018~Last trip here.  Though convienent to where I work I have had the following experiences; waited 30 min for a coffee, ordered through app and coffee was wrong, called they were nice said I could get this replaced the next time I'm in well that would have been great if they weren't out of what I wanted.  Really?  Oh and then it's the little things, no stoppers.  I'm in supply chain order what you Update: I think they finally have things figured out!  Changing to two stars until I know for sure.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 18, 2017~Last trip here.  Though convenient to where I work I have had the following experiences; waited 30 min for a coffee, ordered through app and coffee was wrong, called they were nice said I could get this replaced the next time I'm in well that would have been great if they weren't out of what I wanted.  Really?  Oh and then it's the little things, no stoppers.  I'm in supply chain order what you need.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Nov 17, 2021~It's your stereotypical overpriced drink place. The employees seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with orders. What's cool is that they have one of my favorite brands of juice being sold here: Evolution Fresh. Unfortunately, it costs around 37% more than if you were to buy it at a grocery store. It looks like my favorite drink, matcha green tea frappuccino, is a part of a secret menu because it isn't listed on the store menu. The employees were nice while there though.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Mar 24, 2023~We always love getting coffee here before our nail appointment. The cafe IS open for dining and seating, they are always friendly, and very quick getting orders through.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Mar 24, 2018~This Starbucks gets pretty packed sometimes. There's not a lot of parking. There is 2 other Starbucks in the area which is good cause it's a busy business area. There's a patio outside. When it's summer they turn on the mist to help cool off. I love the caramel frappacino. My sister loves the vanilla bean frappacino.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Feb 24, 2022~I like Starbucks but they tend to never get my order right. Not sure if their headset in the drive through is broken or what but I find it frustrating every time I ask for 1 pump of syrup they also default to their stores 4 pumps lol
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Feb 14, 2023~I have been coming to this location for 4-8 plus years. I typically get the same drink every time. Well yesterday morning I came in and due to issues with My BP I switched my drink up. So when I got there I went to the register and confirmed my drink was decaf vs caffeinated. To my surprise the batista advised me that my mobile order had not come through, but no big deal she will put it in. In the meantime I located where the order went, called them and canceled, but they still charged me since it was a mobile order. Now I'm back speaking to the young lady helping me who was very nice and empathic. Another barista comes up with a mean look and attitude ugh no she has to pay. I asked why that I had already paid and with a very condescending tone it's a fry's we don't get that money. They are not a Starbucks. I said ok, I did not know that. how would I request a refund no and she just walked away. So I paid another 6 dollars for a coffee fine... I walk over to wait frustrated. I hit my vape, she very rudely says don't vape in MY store. Which is not a big deal, but the tone and shitiness. My feelings were hurt and I was just confused by the treatment. I said can we not be a **** to me please. When I grabbed my coffee and asked why she was so rude.  The other  worker said I'm sorry I didn't catch the full thing. I just left Thinking wow that was awful. This rude employee teegan has been there 6 months rarely smiling always looks upset. every morning she gives dirty looks, management has made it very clear that her behavior is completely acceptable and I can just screw off. This is the worst part. I walk in this morning and Craig, whom I have never once seen at the store walks up rudely interrupts my phone call even when holding up my hand gesturing give me a minute he proceeds to talk, resulting in me needing to hang my phone up. He tells me I am no longer able to get my coffee there. I can agree I should have not used a cruise word SINGULAR ONE Which was not directly to her just simply asking her not to be **** to me. Brought tears to my eyes. I go in every day. last year I got all the employees a Christmas card with a gift card. I dropped a 100 in their tip jar just because. I have left with incorrect coffees and chose to not say anything because they were slammed. Maybe if craig was there checking on his staff this would have never happened. I even tried to have a conversation with him afterwards and he refused to have any type of logical or rational conversation with me.My final outcome with his boss is that I don't meet Starbucks values, but not to worry I can still give them my money at other locations........ So I am valuable enough to spend my money at other locations but not good enough to spend my money at the closest Starbucks to my house that I have managed to goto for 8 years with no issues at all. Everyone has bad days, nobody's perfect. I Am appalled by how this was handled. I go in every morning. I ignore her dirty looks, eye rolls and nasty/ hurtful comments she has made under her breath and finally I had enough. if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, I'm going to call it a duck. I stood up for myself wrong to have used a swear word yes. no excuse, however the way it was handled is absolutely rotten, hurtful and has made me feel like I deserved the way I was treated..is this management or punish the customer because their spoke to his manager and she was even worse.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Mar 5, 2020~Today I placed a mobile order for four drinks and two of the drinks I had ordered them with no ice, apparently they did not look at the ticket order because they filled both of those drinks to the top with ice.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Mar 11, 2022~The young woman at the window with black hair usually in a pony tail is SO SWEET. She knows me by name at this point and makes the whole experience great! Great location all around and always gets my order right! -Catherine
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 10, 2021~This location was a good location a couple years ago before the new manager got rid of all the old staff and brought a bunch of people in who have no idea what they are doing! Every time I've been to this location my drink is made wrong somehow it's aggravating because this is the Starbucks by my house and i can't even go to it without wasting my money because my order is messed up. Josh with the red hair is the best tho! Other than that the general manager here is disrespectful and gives terrible service! Don't even waste your time.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jul 5, 2017~This location had changed soooo much since they first opened. The service is great, staff is friendly and drinks come out quick and correct. Applause for sure. Please get someone to fix the enormous pot hole in the drive where you turn in.

Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Dec 2, 2016~I put the following review below. Since then I would like to say this location has improved greatly. The wait time on a drink is now average for starbucks times. The drinks have also gotten better.This location is the worst location for time, you can easily spend 20 to 30 minutes just trying to get one drink and I'm talking every single time. I have even tried pre-ordering my drink online through the mobile app and have issues. If you dont have more that 15 minutes to wait don't go through the drive-thru. Go across the street to the Starbucks at Target or in the shopping plaza you'll be in and out, just no drive thru's there. My drinks are 50/50 on the quality. Never really get food.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Nov 16, 2022~I really try to give people the benefit of the doubt as my husband worked for Starbucks for many years. However, on several occasions I have mobile ordered and nearly 30 min later my order is still not ready. The estimated pick up time really needs to be more accurate.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~May 13, 2022~I don't recommend this actual location itself. I'm leaving a review because I can't reach anybody at the location. Just went through the drive through it's the closest starbs by my house. I've been going here for years. As well as my friends and family. I'm not the only one whom has had terrible services and well this morning. I just had the worst experience in the drive through. The drink that I usually order I know what it looks like I've been ordering it for a long time. There for I know what it taste/looks like. It wasn't that. It tasted gross with carmel in the foam as I asked for NO carmel so I turned to tell the lady that gave me my drink, and tried telling her this doesn't taste like... she immediately snatches the coffee out of my hands and she wouldn't even let me finish telling her what was wrong with it. Then she rudely handed me another drink that looked  more like the drink I ordered, but it tasted the same as the other one I had just handed back! I'm DONE with this location and the rude people whom work here. Where is the customer service now days? There was 2 sweet girls there always but I haven't seen either of them the last few times I've gone. Also I'm throwing my coffee out!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 11, 2022~These negative reviews seem a bit harsh, if you place a mobile order ahead of time you won't have any problem just picking up your drink and leaving. I picked up my drink at 11:10 and was out in the same minute. It is a smaller location, so the parking lot is tricky along with a very long drive thru line. But the workers are helpful, and quick. It was very busy! But they handle it well.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Oct 18, 2022~Horrible!! I come in here almost every single day with mobile order. A majority of the morning crew knows me by name and my order. I'm an ex partner so 99% of the time I'm understanding. Today I went in to the lobby to order a couple of drinks at 10:51a. It was 11:07 when I finally decided to say something to the girl with the Medusa piercing. She was blatantly ignoring me and never acknowledged me. No one in the entire time I stood there asked me if I was waiting for drinks. I said excuse me to MELISSA and she didn't even look up at me. She then proceeded to tell me that my order went in at 10:51 and that I had not been waiting for 17minutes. I told her to check the time and she said it's 11:08. They always complain to me bout how they have crazy customers come in and now I see why. The girls that work here get flustered when they are busy and are so rude to customers countless of times. If you don't like making coffee in a busy coffee shop go work somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Feb 8, 2019~Well Here I am again at yet another Starbucks of course that's me I had to stop that just about every Starbucks and have my special tea drinks. Now being contrary to popular belief I do not drink coffee all day long in fact when I go to Starbucks 95% of my purchases are either ice Chai latte or ice refreshing drinks which are really good as always I do have to give a 5 star because it's Starbucks after all.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 11, 2020~This Starbucks is close to my house and I usually get coffee before work using the mobile app. My coffee has always been ready before or when I get there. All of the staff I've interacted with are super sweet and professional. Today (Veteran's Day) I waited 30 minutes for my coffee because they were so so slammed. I was late to work yesterday for this reason. 5 stars still for me because today the pick up window barista was working SO hard to accommodate mobile orders and walk-in orders. They were seemingly printing out of her machine by the dozen. There were many guests surrounding the counter and she maintained her composure and fast-pace, continually apologizing and thanking people for their patience. I love that attitude. I do kind of wish there was a `"come back later`" voucher or something on the mobile app. With the unpredictable business of this Starbucks, I think it might help employees and customers alike. With three ways to order, drive-thru, mobile (and Uber) and in-person, volume can just build up so fast without the customers or employees knowing what they're in for.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Mar 20, 2017~Not a big fan of Starbucks until recently, this was my first visit to this location.I used to stay away from Starbucks because I try to do low-carb and even their sugar free beverages may end up having tons of them.Recently learned to place orders online, and I placed my 4th mobile order here. I highly recommend mobile order, if you give them the 10 minutes or so, some stores have your beverage ready for you to just pick up, others have a sign to ask for it.Here they had a sign, and Jacob was very friendly and professional, he provided my drink and made sure to ask if everything was OK, he even added more whipped cream for me.This time I decided to try the Misto option (half coffee, half steamed mild).It tastes great (great find!). I did park and walked in to pick up my order, but this location has limited and funny parking, there was a tree in the middle of the parking lot, not sure if it recently fell, or it has grown wild and no one cares.Drive thru highly recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jul 1, 2022~Omg just absolutely terrible service, extremely slow. Go to the next one that's closer to you
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Oct 19, 2018~Eight people working15 people waiting for coffee drinks Worst Starbucks customer service in the World!Entire staff is slow and unorganized!At $6 per cup... you would expect excellence!Get it together Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jul 21, 2019~Lost my back pack here and called 3 days after, they said they 'through it out'...weird that a place throughs a out lost and found in a such a short amount of time (especially sense it was an expensive back pack)...asked the manager about it on the phone but she was too busy to call me and then never called me back...i just don't trust this place. ENTER AT OWN RISK*Hope this helped
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Nov 6, 2018~This Starbucks rocks! I come here a couple of times a week to decompress and read. Some of the baristas know me by name and know my order based on the time of the day I come in. Sometimes it can get really busy during the lunch rush so try to avoid coming in around that time!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Aug 20, 2020~I regret every time I come to this Starbucks so freaking slow. In driv thru 15 min and still have to cars in front. Last time I will come to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Aug 11, 2018~I liked that this one is drive thru! It's very convenient when you have kids and don't want to drag them into a store. They were quick and the baristas were nice. Not a bad experience at all!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Apr 4, 2022~Went in to pickup an order. Noticed one gentleman with a mean look on his face. Noticed he gave horrible service to those he serviced. When I mentioned it to another employee and told him he should smile, they ignored me and told me to have a nice day. So no I don't recommend this location to anyone.The only Starbucks in the valley I have issues with. Management should be aware.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Mar 1, 2021~Iced caramel macchiato with no caramel ? Frap was also flavorless, tasted more like water than coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 2, 2020~Don't Uber eats from this location. No matter what you order it's wrong every time. I ordered a venti Carmel macchiato today with 2 extra shots, 2 Carmel syrup pumps, Carmel drizzle and whip. Nothing! Just coffee. $15.36 for a coffee to be ubered 1.5 miles away. Someone needs to learn to read at this store because last time I ordered this drink I got a iced one instead! Can't read the Extra Hot on the label huh? Refunds mean nothing except that I won't be waking up with my espresso this am. I'm done ordering from here. If your going to be prepared for dissatisfaction for sure. There are 3 other locations that are better. 2500 Happy Valley Rd, and the two at Deer Valley Center.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jul 11, 2017~Wow. Slowest Starbucks I've ever been to in my life. Unless you're the only one here waiting for a drink, plan on waiting at least 15 minutes. The inside of the building is nice and everything, but don't ever come here if you're in a hurry or you'll be extremely frustrated!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Mar 26, 2017~This is a really nice Starbucks! Usually Starbucks feels a bit cramped and small, but this one has a lot of open space to walk and to wait for drinks. My iced caramel macchiato only took about 1 minute to come out! This location has a drive through and a ton of covered patio seating outside. It's located in a nice area with wide roads and limited traffic and congestion. I'm so happy that I live only 1.0 miles from here!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 13, 2017~I usually come here almost every morning and I always order ahead my orders are always correct and ready for me, staff is always friendly and it's always clean. My drinks are always great and I've had some of the food as well everything has been good. It does get busy and the parking gets full pretty quick but I'm usually in and out with no hold up
Phoenix, AZ 85027~2~Dec 26, 2019~I'm giving two stars because they haven't ever messed up my order, but customer service I am pretty disappointed. I had a issue with debit card being left at a drive threw. I wasn't really expecting anything from them but a little apology for also their mistake (yes I'm at fault too) but they made it like it was such a horrible inconvenience for them, even though I had to drive back 25 minutes back to get it. I understand they are busy but there is a serious lack of customer service, this isn't the only instance. This is just current and finally fed up. Will go to a different store.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jun 3, 2017~Big Starbucks. Friendly folks. Lots of parking and lots of room outside at this one. Definitely one of the better Starbucks in the area. Good for large groups or meetings too.... and Michael makes an awesome French press! If you haven't ever tried one you should. Its Sublime!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~May 29, 2019~I think local Starbucks are feeling the sting of Dutch Bros competition. Face to face employees have a much improved demeanor although it's glaringly fake. That's fine though, snobby Starbucks baristas never bothered me before and they always got the drinks right. Since the attempt to be friendlier had been pushed my order hasn't been right a single time. My order is actually pretty simple, cold foam cold brew add cream and hazelnut. Give me back the begrudgingly accurate barisatas please.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Aug 17, 2019~Great customer service and fast service as well. Accidentally ordered drink from wrong location when I showed up here they just made me same drink without extra charge.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 13, 2016~I am almost certain this is the Starbucks of the reject baristas. I have been to a ton of Starbucks all over the valley and the United States. I have NEVER had such in incompetent baristas. They always ask dumb questions or even just make the order wrong. For instance I asked for extra hazelnut typically they just do extra no questions asked. However at this Starbucks they ask how many pumps do you want? Like I have worked there before and know the recipe. Also I ordered a ice Carmel coffee. He handed it to me and it looked very dark. I tasted it and it had no cream in it. When I asked why is there no cream he replied that I didn't ask for it. I have never had to ask for cream before. Another time while pregnant I asked for it to be decaf and they told me they can't do decaf ice coffee. I have ordered this also in the past no problem. It doesn't take rocket science to know instead of icing a caffeinated coffee you just ice a decaf . I am done giving this place a chance every time it's a whole go around for just a simple order. I'll get my butt out of the car and go to the Starbucks in target across the street.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Oct 10, 2020~Stuck in a drive through line of 30 minutes!!! Come on it's coffee people. I am an idiot for waiting,  but once you're in the line your stuck and cannot get out. Last time I come into this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~May 4, 2016~Wow... Worst Starbucks experience EVER. No one greeted me. I was the only person at the register and it took four minutes for anyone to even acknowledge that I was standing there waiting to order. In that time, two people were told to attend to me yet no one came over or said hello.  I counted four people working.Upon ordering two drinks, the Americano arrived lukewarm after five minutes. I waited another two minutes before asking where my Frappacino was. No one had even thought to start it. It took an additional ten minutes for them to finish my drink order. The Frappacino wasn't full to the top, so they loaded it with whip cream. The dome cap was a waste of resources because there was nothing for it to dome over.I paid almost $9.00 for two drinks and hated every moment of the experience in addition to being disappointed with the outcome.BUCK UP AND GET ORGANIZED OVER THERE!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 21, 2018~This is, without a doubt, the slowest Starbucks in the state of Arizona. Possibly the slowest in America. Unless you have an extra 20-30 minutes to wait for your drink, I don't recommend this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Sep 9, 2018~I am very disappointed in the service and drinks from this location. I had a mobile order that they hid behind the counter. I waited for 8 minutes before I asked if they had started my drinks. Not one barista asked me what I was waiting for. They had the drinks ready behind the counter which I could not see. When they gave them to me 2 drinks were incorrect. I didn't notice until I got in the car. So I had to drive back and have them remake the drinks. The barista that remade my drink did a horrible job. It was a hot grande drink that he only filled about 12oz. So not only did I have to wait a long time, get drinks remade, and still didn't get a decent drink, they did nothing to try and make up for their mistakes.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Jun 9, 2016~This place is just okay. There really is a different experience between drive thru and ordering inside. I can't really tell which one is slower though. You figure when you order 2 drinks, they come out at the same time but no, I got my first drink then 5-6 mins later my second one came out. The batista taking my order barely said a thing. Just the usual 'what can I get for you' and just okays and stuff after. The annoying part about any establishment is when they assume you are done ordering. Ask `"would there be anything else today`" rather than give me my total. I usually go through the drive thru and drinks and pretty quick, the only thing that takes long are the people in front of you. Starbucks can't control how long it takes someone to order so I won't hold that against the place. I think the mistake may be having mobile ordering. When an order comes through,  it's like all work stops on everyone's orders who are actually at the building so that they can make the online order first. I understand the concept, people like their things quick, but if it makes one customer happy but irritates everyone else who's been in line, is it actually worth it? I saw probably 3 or 4 people get their online orders after I had been sitting there for some time waiting. Some staff is friendly, some is not. The first person I ran into here today was the manager as soon as I walked in the door and she just kind of looked at me as she sped passed even tho i made an effort to smile at her. She was stocking or whatever she was doing. So I guess she was too busy. I do like Starbucks and have yet to have an order messed up so of course I'll be back. I just want you guys to step up your game, if not in speed of service, maybe customer service so we actually enjoy the fact we have to wait 10-15 minutes for our order.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 14, 2018~I tried using my samsung pay but the associate waa not familiar with their machine as to where to place the phone, all the while shes sighing and rolling her eyes.  The next customer was paying with applepay, same attitude. Very rude customer service. Age made have paid a factor but be knowledgeable
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 19, 2016~This is the slowest Starbucks I've ever been too. The drive through takes 15+ minutes no matter what time of day. And inside is even worse. Please don't make this your morning stop if you are on a time crunch. And secondly this is probably a bunch of the most uneducated group of baristas I've ever met. And they aren't even nice to top it off. Please Avoid this Starbucks till get better baristas that care about quality and speed. Because right now this team has neither
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Oct 26, 2018~Three separate team members told me they'd `"be right with me`" and then continued to serve customers in the drive through line. If you drive into this location you're golden, but if you walk in then prepare to go thirsty.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Aug 30, 2019~I go into this store pretty often and especially on happy hours. Everytime I have gone they always get my drinks out quickly and are friendly. I went into this store yesterday for their happy hour and couldnt help but notice there was only 5 of them working their fastest. I mentioned how difficult is must be getting all those drinks out with so few of them in which one of the girls responded `"we try our best`" with a smile. They got all 4 of my drinks out in the cafe fast but I still felt really bad for how hard they were all working. I hope they get more staffing for the next happy hour for their sakes. Thank you awesome baristas!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Nov 22, 2018~This is BY FAR the worst Starbucks. There's always a long wait with the people taking their time to make the drinks. Today it was a 22 minute wait. (This was a mobile order too) I started avoiding it and going to the new one on 32nd st and union hills when I can. But I would recommend only going to this Starbucks if you have time for about a 20 minute wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Apr 3, 2019~(Update!) I walked in the following day to get a sandwich and mentioned my coffee episode from the day before, and the manager overheard me talking to the cashier, gave me a cold brew for free today and rushed it out. This is great! I have to acknowledge that while I had a bad experience yesterday, they made up for it today. (Yesterday's review) I've been to this Starbucks several times as it is close to my house with few problems. But today I walked in to get a coffee quick before work. I walked right up to the register, ordered a cold brew (not a time consuming drink), and stood there 10 minutes without them making it. I was late and there was no sign of them making it so I just left. I work in the service industry so I know I'm not the only customer they had, but the cashier was just standing there watching the two guys make drinks and they were obviously behind. So I'm out $5 today, late for work and have no coffee.

Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Oct 19, 2020~Way too long to get through the drive through. I have been sitting in the line for 20 minutes already with 11 cars ahead of me. Won't be back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Oct 9, 2019~I have no idea why this Starbucks is rated this low. I actually go out of my way to this location because the service is amazing! They are always so friendly and quick, they have never gotten my order wrong, and they really are a great start to my morning.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Sep 11, 2018~This location makes the worst drinks. Absolutely no consistency. At least one time a week they mess up my drink order....and I don't have time in the morning to go back so they can fix their mistake. I'm going back to Dutch Bros!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jun 2, 2019~Not super close to me but I drive the extra 15 min because the staff is always professional and very nice. Thanks Keri and Hadley.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Mar 7, 2016~Nice Starbucks. New store. But the WiFi is totally fracked. Never seen speeds this slow. Ever. Something very wrong.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 30, 2018~The worst experience I've ever had at a Starbucks. They aren't even busy and they forgot my order twice. The drinks came out as expected as we patiently waited for our food order. After about 5 min I asked about our order, I could see a bagel sitting out but no one was even preparing the sandwich. They then gave me the bagel which was not toasted as ordered and barely warm. They said the sandwich was on its way. A few minutes later we inquired about the sandwich to find out they totally forgot about it. They did refund our order but it doesn't change how I was made to feel. Frustrated by the lack of common courtesy and follow through. It was obvious that the drive through was given the priority, I was made to feel like I was an interruption.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Nov 8, 2018~So today I went to starbuck's drive thru as I do almost everyday.It was taking a bit longer, was getting mad. When I get to the order box as always Melissa's nice voice was on and was very apologetic saying that both of their machines were down, sorry that they was taking a little longer as well as offering lots of options for me. I ended up with a coffee with my pumpkin spice in it and all the stuff that normally goes on my drink with half milk steamed, it wasn't half bad, I was pleased with it. The only thing that would of made it better, if it had been free. Not sure she had the authority to do so all I know is I was mad until I heard her letting me know what was going on. Thanks for making sure I got my caffeine fix one way or another.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Aug 4, 2017~The Girls here are super nice Shout out To Melissa!! And Maryann they are super in drive thru.Melissa so glad to see your back in the window yesterday we missed you on Wednesday we waited 20 mins my boss and I both said Thursday so glad she was back in window today, love your bubbly spirt and your speed of service. We just wish you worked more.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~May 22, 2016~I'm torn between the stars. During the week this Starbucks is pretty quick and very pleasant. On the weekends, the staff is rude, doesn't care about orders and I literally wait in the drive thru for 20 minutes waiting to order and get my drink. I just visited this location today and when I pulled up my drink wasn't even ready. The guy handed me my drink 3-5 mins later and the waffle cone frap topping was missing. When I asked him about it his response  was `"oh this was a waffle cone frap?`" Really?!?! My drink doesn't taste good AT ALL.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jan 4, 2020~I just got the worst guava white tea ever. Didn't taste until I got to work. No guava flavor at all!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 14, 2015~I am beyond stoked that this location was opened! I'm definitely a frequent visitor.  Service is excellent too!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 2, 2016~Unfortunately you will not be seeing the customer service at this location that Starbucks is known for. I waited in line about 30 minutes and had to repeat my entire order to the cashier at least three times over. When I finally got to the front and pulled my $20 bill out it ripped in half but they refused to take it. even though he spoke to the manager. It wasn't like I had a handful of pennies! most restaurants have some tape for the rare occasions when a bill tears. It really sucked because I waited so long for my peppermint mocha. I actually had to go to the bank and get another $20 and come back. I went inside to tell the manager.( she was the one who actually refused to take it) from now on I will definitely be using ANY other Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 8, 2019~Got my order wrong. Cashier didn't really care, gave me a different price at the menu than what I got when I got to the drive through window to pay. Customer service could be better
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Sep 19, 2017~Always out of ingredients for drinks, I've come to this location countless times on my way to work with a mobile order, and I'm not sure why it took me so long to realize I just need to go to a different location, because I'll wait around for 10 minutes before asking where my mobile order is, at which point they'll claim they were trying to let me know they were out of that drink (but really just continued to make others drinks, see me standing there, and not say anything). I think it's unbelievable that before 10 am you're out of ingredients. I'm never coming to this Starbucks again. Tell whoever does your orders to order more.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Apr 7, 2017~This is the SLOWEST Starbucks I have ever been to.Holy cow, I get so bored waiting in line or in the drive thru. I have never waited less than 15-20 minutes in this drive thru, I always have to make sure I have extra time if I want coffee from here. The baristas are super nice when you pre-order, but make sure you speak up and let them know you are there, otherwise you will be standing there forever.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 10, 2019~Slowest Starbucks I've ever been to. Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes for your order almost every time. Doing a mobile order does not speed things up
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Dec 11, 2017~This Starbucks never ever gets my order right ever. No matter what I order they never pay attention and give me the wrong item.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Aug 15, 2016~Slowest. Drive thru. Ever. I try not to make a judgment based on one experience so this was my second time going through the drive through and I literally put my car in park while I was waiting, both times, it was that slow. Not sure why. But 2/2 means I'm going somewhere else. Also the first time I went they royally messed up my drink and nearly made me diabetic with the sweetener. Thankfully I tasted it before I pulled away. Hopefully they get their act together there!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~May 16, 2016~I work really close to this, so my co-workers and I go here often, there has not been a nice experience in this Starbucks ever! They have made my drink wrong so many times that at this point I expect them to have to re make it every time. I has not written a revue because they are so new I was giving them a chance to get over the learning curve, but after 3 solids months and today's experience I have had it! I purchase a simple teva tea this morning, I walked over this afternoon, and just wanted more hot water.. Which they wanted to charge me again for the tea!! This does not happen at any other Starbucks! Not to mention that baristas are not friendly, they have 5-7 people and it took us 30 minutes to get 4 drinks! Don't come to this Starbucks if you want good customer service, because you won't find it!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Oct 17, 2015~The baristas are friendly and the store is always clean. Love having a new fast drive thru in the area! Huge patio is a plus as the weather cools down
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~May 18, 2016~Very rare that I complain but within the last 3 weeks the service has become so careless along with uncaring. I work in this industry and am a little more forgiving when things are not perfect BUT when I have pointed out several times that I have not received my food or drink while 5 people behind me have received everything and are on their way while I wait for my tea and pumkin loaf...unacceptable. Last time I come here, will save me 15 min of my day. :(
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Dec 19, 2016~I love the baristas here...  contrary to what I've read, I've never had any of the baristas be rude to me.  This is a VERY busy location so expect a wait time from morning to about noon.  To avoid the rush, I usually use their mobile ordering option on my way to work and pick it up at this location...  and it's 95% of the time always ready for me when I walk in.  I absolutely recommend mobile ordering to cut on the wait time, just give yourself 10-15 min before pick up. Also, if you order the wrong thing or they don't have a food item you ordered, be aware they can't give you refund because you technically didn't pay for it there... if they can't accommodate you with a different item then you will need to call the 800# and request one.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Aug 31, 2019~Love the staff, very friendly !!! The drive thru is very quick no matter how long the line is!!! Love their Matcha with soy milk, as well as their Iced teas!!! Heaven on Earth!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Aug 2, 2019~I went to this Starbucks before 8:30 and went through drive through but no one acknowledged me so I looked online to see what time it closed at but they didn't close until 9. I drove to the window and there was a girl who looked at us and then went to lock the window. While I was trying to get her attention a young man appeared to tell us that they're close but I told them that online it says they don't close until 9.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 10, 2016~Never been pleased with this location but today was really the last straw. I've had rude employees who look and sound like they hate their job. And before, it was small slip ups, like they missed an extra pump of caramel or they pushed my second drink down the line and I had to wait twice as long. But today they completely messed up my drink order; it's no where near what I ordered. And when she called it out, she said it correctly. It's written on the cup correctly. But it's no where near what I ordered and I am no longer going to come to this location. Sorry, but I think a retraining needs to happen.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Jun 12, 2016~Typical Starbucks: good coffee and snacks. Lines are normally long if u come in the morning. One nice thing about this Starbucks  is that it has outside seating with misters.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 20, 2015~If anyone writes this place a bad review, please just give them more coffee :) the workers in this place are the biggest sweethearts !! I go in here a lot with tons of orders and they have all the patience in the world when I'm ordering. And they're super fast. Def one of my favorite spots !
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Feb 26, 2016~This is my local/fave Starbucks. They got mobile order on point. Just like any of your local B-Bucks, it can get busy. I recently discovered that you can add fizz to yo tea here. Say what?! Life changin'...
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Oct 18, 2015~Baristas were friendly and efficient even at 6 in the morning on the weekend. As a barista at another coffee house myself, I know that can be tricky! That friendliness is also something I haven't encountered much in my trips to various other Starbucks. With a great team, anything is possible though. They clearly had great rapport behind bar, and kept busy cleaning and stocking the whole time I was in the store. Thanks for the great service!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Dec 23, 2015~The girls are amazing and friendly, quick and always have a smile!! Two thumbs up to this new establishment!! So happy to have a Starbucks I can use a drive thru ..
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Sep 14, 2018~They closed at minimum 20 minutes early! Very very disappointed. This is my typical spot to stop on Friday night (which is my Monday morning.) absolutely ridiculous.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Mar 14, 2016~Just walked out of this Starbucks and am VERY pissed off. Coffee tastes like CRAP. I asked for extra shots and they just used regular brew. NOT cool.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Apr 21, 2017~Ordered a dark roast on the mobile app... I know a pour over is required at the hour I ordered (after 11am). I walked in and saw the barista pulling out of the pike pot and put it over with the mobile orders. I asked if this was the dark roast and she said yes. I said are you sure because I saw you fill this cup with pike. She said I put a shot of espresso so it's fine. What? I'm not getting what I paid for because you're too lazy to do a pour over? She was wearing a black apron which I thought meant coffee master... she obviously has no focus on coffee. The other one standing next to her was just laughing. Yes, she offered to make me my pour over in the end, but only because i caught her lying to me.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 12, 2016~Have only been here on the weekends - every single time it is a twenty minute wait in the drive through, no acknowledgment of long wait, drinks not ready, poor quality. We've gone multiple times and this has been the experience each time, not going back.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Oct 11, 2016~Let me tell you I come here everyday but today Melissa was in the window that girl has it going on.Thank you Melissa I got in and out!!!!!! Your awesome girl!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~May 5, 2016~Very disappointed with this Starbucks! It took my husband and I five times of going to Starbucks and having them mess up our order for us to finally write a bad review, and it's upsetting to do so because I truly do love Starbucks coffee. So when this one opened we were so excited because of how close it is to our home, but today was our most recent visit to this Starbucks, and yet again they messed up our order. While waiting for our drinks and warmed up blueberry muffin we overheard the woman next to us telling her friend how she had to have them remake her drink because they messed it up the first time. When we finally got our drinks (Mixed Caramel Macchiato) neither of them were mixed, and mine definitely tasted funny, then I tried my husbands, and his was absolutely disgusting. We then waited a few more minutes for them to give us a warm piece of banana bread, NOT the warm blueberry muffin we ordered. We told them the order was incorrect, so they swapped it out for a cold blueberry muffin. Again NOT what I ordered. Our experiences at this particular Starbucks has been very upsetting. We have always been big fans of Starbucks because of the consistency no matter what location your at. This one really let us down. I would be very surprised if we ever go back!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~3~Nov 29, 2017~I had bad experience with this Starbucks location. Most of the time I have been there the drink does not come out right. I ordered cafe mocha with whip cream. They forgot to put the whip cream and the coffee was terrible. I had to throw the drink which I have never done at any starbucks location. Some days the berry hibiscus will be good and other days it would be really flavorless. There are few times when the coffee came out good as well. I am guessing certain people who are preparing the coffee are not up to the standard. I go to this location as it has drive by, else I use the starbucks which is in aqua Fria highway.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~4~Nov 12, 2015~Best triple espresso thus far, even thou they claim all Starbucks are the same, espresso here made by Batista lady Vickie Is a delight.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Apr 2, 2016~Love this place. The service is always top notch and Katie is a great representative of Starbucks. She is very friendly, attentive, and is great at what she does. Joey is great as well. I use the mobile app most of the time and when I arrive the coffee is ready to go and i'm in and out. I would recommend this place to friends and anyone who likes a good cup of coffee or any Starbucks original drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Jun 29, 2016~By far, this is the slowest and most lame Starbucks I have ever visited. The drive thru is ridiculous. I work at Safeway Corp across the street and this store needs to step it up.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Feb 9, 2018~This morning was bad. I did my mobile order from home, a 7 min drive, I get there and waited 15 more min for my drink. I ordered an Iced Vente Coconut Milk `"Mocha`" Macchiato with 4 shots of Blonde. What I got was a Iced Vente Coconut Milk Blonde, no mocha no carmel or if there was I couldn't taste it. I understand you were busy, but I would appreciate it if you would make the drink correctly.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Nov 22, 2017~I love this Starbucks! Dom is a great barista! I come here to do homework everyday and it's such a great environment thanks to all the great baristas. The coffee tastes great every time!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~May 14, 2016~This Starbucks is a joke. I waited In the drive thru for 30mins ON THE WEEKEND with only 5 other cars in front of me. When I got to the window, the young girl opened the window, didn't acknowledge me,didn't take my card, give me my order, instead, she was chatting with the other employees standing like there line isn't wrapping around the building. I'm not one to write reviews, but this Starbucks pissed me off. Definitely left a bad taste in my mouth for Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85027~5~Jan 13, 2016~This is by far my favorite Starbucks in the valley!!! Everyone there is beyond friendly with great customer service!!! (Shout out to Jeremy) They all seem to love their job and they always make my iced green tea latte perfect!! :) I live all the way out in Avondale and this is my go to place to study!!
Phoenix, AZ 85027~1~Oct 7, 2016~I travel a lot for work, so I frequent this Starbucks maybe twice a week sometimes. I have become increasing dissatisfied with the service, it seems they can't keep good employees long, there is high turnover and They have made my drinks made wrong several times. I probably wouldn't be posting this review, but tonight topped it off. I pulled in at 8:59pm, the lights were still on, signs and all, and there was one car in front of me. The car in front of me pulled to the window and got his drink, and drove away as I'm sitting still waiting to put my order in. I waited a few minutes, attempted to get somebody's attention through the speaker, but no response(they HAD seen me)Meanwhile, the two baristas inside kept moving around watching me out the window, but saying nothing. As I approached the window, they went around the corner and hid, yet there were two drinks they had left on the counter(presumably theirs). I sat there waiting for them to come tell me something such as`"we are closed`" even though I was there before they closed, but they intentionally ignored me. Once again, more increasingly poor service from this Starbucks. I spend hundreds every year, and through business dealings and other occasions at times thousands in a years time, I'm thinking maybe I need to take my business somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 15, 2024~Oh man, I'm sad to see the ratings so low for this Starbucks. It's my most frequented one *because* I love the staff there.  They are always cheerful, polite, and kind to us and I know that's gotta be hard in the world today. I really appreciate them for it.  There's one barista who knows me by name which is probably an indication that I'm there far too often ;)  But in an impersonal world of chain restaurants, it's such a sweet thing to be recognized.There was a period of a few weeks where our drinks were consistently `"off`" if they had any special changes, but that was several months ago and they seem to have sorted it out.  Now everything is what I expect to get.My kid and I used to come here and work when they were homeschooled and we were always greeted with kindness. It felt like a true `"third place`" not just a faceless chain.My other shout out for this particular location is that the cafe is open until 10pm and drive thru orders until 11:30pm.  Hardly anything is open that late in Phoenix!  This is greatly appreciated after later evening kid activities. Last night our family went in for hot chocolate at 9:30pm after our kids' school play and it was awesome to have a family-friendly place to hang out for a few minutes.Bathrooms and the cafe itself are clean. Straws, etc. are well stocked and easily accessible. This has been a family favorite for 4 years now.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Dec 7, 2024~There is a sign on the door that says the inside Starbucks is not open only the drive-through from 1 PM to 6:15 PM. I was hoping to have some tea and get some work done today.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 13, 2024~There's a reason the ratings are so low for Starbucks now. And there's a reason I go to Dutch bros instead. $6 for a small (8oz), iced caramel macchiato with only ONE shot of espresso. Which tastes like I'm drinking a cup of milk. Whereas going to Dutch bros, you spend $5 for a 16oz (small) cup and the coffee is delicious there. I used to be obsessed with Starbucks, but I'm highly disappointed how they've turned out. Never coming back.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~May 18, 2024~Matthew that was working the drive-through yesterday was so kind and helpful!  Matthew, you really made my day!  Thank you :)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Mar 2, 2024~This location ALWAYS forgets my splenda, and it's really annoying. Any time I go there, they always mess my drink up. It's very rare if I get a drink made the way I ask for them to make it. I'm very disappointed. It's like they make the drink by the quickest and easiest way possible. They seriously need to look at the sticker that's on the cup because 90% of the time, they just use the coffee and milk and skip the rest! It's ridiculous! I'm not asking for that hard of a drink to make either...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Sep 14, 2024~The worker had attitude after I told her i wanted a venti not a grande and told me I didn't specify what size I wanted and I told her as a worker you should ask me what size if i didn't tell you
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 26, 2024~I'm a big fan of Starbucks, and still use my gold card, but I just left there very unimpressed... i ordered a grande hot soy chai and a ham and Swiss croissant and a bacon, sausage, and egg wrap. My drink was made right away, but my food items took an additional 15 minutes to be made - and there was no one waiting for their order besides me in the lobby. The barista apologized and said they forgot to start my order- then gave me my food items burnt and hard. I would have asked for them to remake them, but I was already running late and the barista was more distracted with the conversation she was having with her manager...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Sep 29, 2023~When I place an order, I anticipate a straightforward transaction where I pay and receive my order promptly. However, in this instance, I experienced something different. The woman at the drive-thru window decided to express her opinion, informing me that my disabled child was seated illegally. It's disheartening that she presumed to have knowledge on this matter, especially considering she has no license and certification in SEBB. My child was not placed in the car illegally, and the presence of a handicapped placard should have been a clear indication of a disabled child. I let her know that her opinion was not factually correct and I'll be going someplace else for my drinks from now on. This happened at 10:15am, I'm sure she's very bright and has a warm personality. But she should stick to what she knows and stop spouting off misinformation to customers. Parents with disabled children already get enough negativity from people who don't understand what's going on. We really don't need it first thing in the morning from a drive thru window.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 10, 2024~Zero stars! If you're that mad and bitter in the morning, you should not be working at a coffee place. It seems like the girl that was taking the order was having a nervous breakdown. There were literally three cars in the drive-through lol I went to a different Starbucks, then I usually go to which was a mistake. I've been to this same Starbucks in the afternoon, and a man was rude to me this time it was a woman! I mean everybody here has an attitude. I'll never come to this Starbucks again. They also took my stars and my money! She gave real misery energy like find somewhere else to work if you don't wanna deal with people. I was nothing but nice to her, and she was a witch.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 11, 2023~I ordered a drink for my daughter with decaf. I got a drink that was not decaf and the lady said go around I will remake one for you. I then went around again and she gave me a drink and a broken straw. How could you.. I already left not knowing she broke the straw so my daughter had a drink but straw was not working after her drink was same height as the broken straw.. sham on you lady who was talking on intercom Sham on you!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 21, 2023~I came by after work in the drive-thru for a quick snack before I got home. A sweet, sweet girl named Tara (I hope that's the correct spelling) took my order in the kindest way. She was very pleasant to speak to and so patient. Usually at such a later hour, I expect employees to get a bit cranky (which is totally understandable), but she was bright and motivated to do her job. Food and drink is good as always, but Tara should for sure get a raise for her performance. I wish I could've tipped her more! Definitely returning for the good service.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Feb 26, 2023~I like to drink pour overs. Pour overs are a basic premium coffee product that should be respected for the pleasure they provide. Everytime I go into ANY starbucks to get a pourover, the employees try to talk me out of it. This last time I ordered a pour over, the employee not only tried to talk me out of it but made fun of me to the next customer for ordering one. Starbucks markets itself as a gourmet coffee shop that cares about all things coffee but it doesn't seem like the employees are getting the memo. I am SO ready to support the next coffee business that acts to displace starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 27, 2024~Closing times inaccurate. Internet sucks. With Starbucks being the most expensive Internet cafe with the crappiest services. I encourage everyone to one star them into oblivion.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 17, 2023~This Starbucks is the best in the entire valley!!!!!! My drink is always perfect. Quick and efficient servers/baristas. After so many mishaps at other locations, this is the only location I will go to if I have a choice
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 8, 2023~I've been coming here for awhile the staff is normally so kind and they move really quick .but today some young  gentleman was taking my order at the drive through and he was being so rude and rushing me by saying `"what else `" in the middle of me speaking then when I pulled up we waited for about 5 minutes before we paid or anything so finally we decided to just leave because it was not worth waiting for.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jun 24, 2023~There drinks are pretty consistent but when I ordered a coffee cake that $hit was like 2 days old and crunchy
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 12, 2023~I honestly don't know why this Starbucks has as many bad reviews as it does. Everyone is always so nice! All times of the day, doesn't matter. My drink order is always right at this one too.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 11, 2023~I have had several poor experiences. I only go to this location if I have to. I definitely do not do Uber eats at this location because they don't give me my straws even though I check the box, they're inconsistent making my drink, I caught a girl talking about me (believe me I confronted her) and they close the lobby way early and make mobile orders sit in the long line in the drive through. I pretty much go to the other locations as this one is poorly managed and inconsistent.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Apr 26, 2024~Very poor customer service. Starbucks 98% percent of the time has beyond excellent service. I randomly stopped at this location for the 1st time because it was on my way but  never again personal was beyond rude and lacked in customer service, sure didn't represent the Starbucks at all . Didn't smile, body language was a nightmare, didn't give me a receipt even though I asked for one and still messed up my order and asked me to move forward I refuse to move because I was waiting on my receipt and another barista brought me the receipt make drink and also body language poor and l had to ask for a cup of ice again and for my receipt also. Baristas lead by example and surely this 2 baristas need 1 to leave outside problems outside work environment or just quit because we cust value Starbucks and they all should represent Starbucks embody core value, speed and service! Visit was 4/26 @ 5:42pm
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 25, 2023~This is the third time I've mobile ordered a chocolate chip protein bar through drive thru and they've given me a peanut butter protein bar. It is frustrating being the label clearly says chocolate chip but they seem to rush every time and just grab the first protein bar there... then I have to walk back into the store and grab the right one, what was the point of mobile ordering it.. I've also had drinks made completely wrong from the recipe like the caramel apple spice. They made it with espresso and milk.. a drink that is supposed just be steamed apple juice, syrup, drizzle and some whip... This is the closet starbucks to me but I always seem to leave disappointed by something.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Apr 11, 2023~I order on the app and never have any issues. It's a busy Starbucks. Plan accordingly and do yourself a favor and order ahead on the app. It just helps to ensure that your order will be correct. I come here every Saturday and don't mind the drive thru line. Not the happiest workers, but not rude either. I think they just get overwhelmed at this store. No complaints here.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 22, 2021~Gotta love paying for a $5+ dollars for a tea and taking two sips and it's all gone because they fill it with all ice..... never going to this location again. Makes sense why it was the only empty Starbucks.....
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 21, 2021~So it's been awhile since I've been to this Starbucks. Honestly I go out of my way and avoid this location like the plague. And to add insult to injury the parking is a nightmare due to the construction in the center. Against my better judgment I decided to give them another chance. My bad. I had to go into the Hallmark store to mail a package. I mobile ordered before entering the Hallmark. Paid to ship my package, walk back to my vehicle and drive over to Starbucks. Parked in a red zone because once again the lot is a sh*t $how. Walk in with a nice lady who was getting herself a afternoon treat. She didn't mobile she ordered at the counter. Imagine my surprise after waiting for 10 minutes nice ladies drink is ready, we exchanged niceties  and she is on her way. I inquire about my drink. It's not ready yet! No $h*t. So I watch Abby start to prepare my cold brew with salted caramel cream. Now I don't mean any disrespect but a blind man could have made my drink faster. She worked at a sloth pace. Long story short it took 23 minutes for me to get my coffee. And I'm pretty sure she put white mocha instead of caramel syrup. I order this drink at least 3x's a week. I know how it's supposed to taste. 2 others had mobile ordered and their drinks took just as long to make. What's the point in using the app when it'd be faster to order at the counter. 43rd &amp; T-Bird Starbux I'm done with you.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Sep 22, 2016~First, I have to say that I am a pretty regular Starbucks customer. I have a Gold Card and spend roughly $17 - $20 a week depending on my mood. Second, this is not my normal Starbucks location but I do visit it a couple times a month when I am in the area for errands. It is not my go to location for a couple of reasons.One, even though they have a convenient drive thru it takes a ridiculous amount of time to get your beverage. Even if there is only 2 cars in front of you it takes 15 minutes, on a good day. Two, for some reason my drink is always more. At my normal Starbucks my go to Venti iced coconut milk mocha macchiato is $5.78. At this Starbucks it's $6.25. Three my drink is usually not correct. Last visit I asked for 2 extra pumps of white mocha. After pulling a way I take a drink and almost spit coffee all over my truck. Reading the cup the girl put a +6 instead of just 6 pumps. I believe it normally has 4 pumps. Horribly bitter from all the syrup. Today, I order just a plain iced coconut milk mocha macc and once again I get in my truck and drive away I can tell they did not use coconut milk but regular dairy. I can no longer drink milk. For reasons none of you want to hear! And it didn't have the normal caramel or mocha drizzle.The inside is usually clean, tables wiped, trash picked up, restrooms in order. And they have a nice little patio for nicer weather. But with the repeated mistakes and higher prices and increased wait time I think I will stick to my normal, they how's it going, the usual Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 7, 2023~I come here every morning almost I ask them for lite ice every time and when I get to the window my venti drink is filled with ice. What is so hard about going easy on the ice. The drive thru really need to be a little more attentive
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Dec 5, 2022~I came to this location tonight and ordered a Venti iced Royal English tea latte. First they handed me my drink hot and I asked if they could remake it iced cause I ordered it iced. The girl at the drive through window proceeded to tell me that I could not order this drink iced because it was a hot drink only. I informed her that I always get this drink so I know I am able to order my drink iced. She went to ask one of her coworkers in the back and came back saying that if I wanted my drink iced it would take an extra 5 mins to make it iced....I agreed and waited. She then came back with what looked like an iced water and handed it to me. I am very disappointed knowing that this drink is on one of Starbucks menu items and it wasn't even made right.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Mar 27, 2023~SO disappointed!!! Monday March 27th @ 7:56 am. Ordered a refreshers beverage and I kid you not, only 1 cup of beverage, the REST just PACKED with ice. This is over the top ridiculous as I paid $7 for this drink. The dragon drink was also so watered down that it didn't taste right. On the plus side, the server was lovely and they remembered to add my reusable cup discount.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 12, 2023~On Saturday March 11th @ 7:45am my friend &amp; I walked into this Starbucks.. there were no cars in the drive thru &amp; 1 customer at a table. We approached the counter. And waited and waited and waited... We looked at our watches over five minutes had passed. I asked and we should leave. There were 4 people working 2 at one end 1 making coffee &amp; 1 seeeping the floor . Not one of these girls looked up, acknowledged us, or even said just a moment, I'll be right with you nothing... When we finally did get our coffee, I asked for a grande with a little bit of ice. When I got the drink it was full of ice with a little bit of milk in it, I asked the girl is this a little bit of ice.? She commented`" yes ma'am that's it!! &amp;looked away. We were in a time crunch to go to our meeting. Otherwise there is no way I would've excepted that drink. We paid over five dollars for our drinks and food and this is the service week yet? Absolutely not nobody deserves to be treated this way looked at this way or talk to you this way.!!  my recommendation to everybody is do not do not go to this location. The staff are extremely rude. The drinks are not made correctly! Yelp requires you to hit one star I would hit negative negative negative stars on this establishment!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Apr 9, 2022~World's slowest drive thru... waited in line for 20 min and it's 3:40 in the afternoon
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 2, 2020~Very rude employees ‼ I asked for coconut milk in my drink and she out 2% and when in asked her to change it she got mad and rolled her eyes. Also , The set of where to stand is redicoulous and if your mask slips down a little bit they are rude and ask you to leave if you can't keep it on correctly.. even though they have the plastic sheilds at register and I was standing on the black dot 6 ft away‍.  I truly believe businesses should be providing clean masks at every entrance.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 12, 2023~we waited 5 min to even be acknowledged, was getting ready to leave then they finally took our order and both drink orders were wrong when we got them.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Dec 25, 2019~Great customer service! Came here on Christmas around 9 a.m. Friendly greeting by lady who took our order. Got a sausage breakfast sandwich that had egg and cheese on it with English muffin. To drink got large Americano for hubby and large caramel macchiato for me. Food was hot and good. Coffee of course was delicious. Timed a car going through drive thru. Took 11 minutes from end of line to getting drink at window. About same wait time inside store. Very busy both drive thru and lobby but all workers working diligently and efficiently.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Dec 12, 2022~Poor planning. How can they be out of both cold brew and nitro cold brew in the morning? Those are my 2 go-to low calorie drinks. They said have to wait 2 hrs for them to make it.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 3, 2023~I'm so tired of coming here and the coffee isn't made right and some of the workers are just rude I spend money almost everyday and it definitely isn't worth it. Zero stars if I could tbh
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Nov 1, 2021~This place never has the crunch topping for caramel ribbon crunch. Sometimes they run out of caramel too. Wish management could figure this out. I keep having to drive to other coffee shops around me and this is my closest Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Feb 9, 2018~One of the nicer Starbucks I've been to. It is always so clean and organized and the employees here are always so friendly, however, the drive-through at this location really sucks first thing in the morning. And because of the location of where this Starbucks is located in the shopping center, it makes it hard for the people trying to enter and exit this location as the people at the drive through block the entrance. This last time I came here, I only ordered an iced coffee and it took almost 20 minutes for it to come out due to all the people at the drive-thru. This was a bit disappointing since I was in a rush to get someplace and was hoping to be in and out. They only had 2 people working to make drinks during the rush hour, which I think they would've had a lot more workers to make things run more smoothly. I'll try and remember not to come to this location during rush hours or when I'm in a rush as it can and probably will take a long time just for a simple drink. I'll come back any other time though.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jun 30, 2020~If rude had four daughters these chicks would be it! I accidentally left my mask at home, I tied my sweatshirt around my mouth... my sister and I walked in and you would've thought Beyoncé was trailing behind us the way we got starred at...( super awkward) the barista rudely asked if I had a mask, I said no .. with her bare hands she gave me one, ( ew, germs!  she should've handed me the mask with gloves ‍) the barista asked me to cover my nose, which I declined... as expected per my treatment from waking in the door .. she was rude... meanwhile another barista mask wasn't covering her nose! When my sister was asking question about the coffe she wanted to order... it was as if she was disturbing them.. they would rudely respond back to her with one word answers to her question.... which made her ask more questions.. honestly, it was way too early for all this drama... on the bright side... she got her coffee super fast! Any who, let's do better y'all! Some people might have health conditions to wear covering their mouth is the best they can do without compromising their own health. If someone forgets a mask, be polite about it... graciously hand them one without those judge eyes!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 16, 2020~Had to ask 3 times in drive through for a quad shot vanilla latte. Paid 6.46 for a drink. By the color and taste it was not a quad. Poor service and expensive drink and still got it wrong.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 18, 2020~Drive thru only had 5 cars but took 20 minutes. Slooooooooooooooooooow. Thanks for your patience does not cut it for a company that used to be known for customer service. Second strike...in drive thru with one car ordering. Took so long I parked and went inside. Took forever for barista to self start as she shot the shit without starting my food order. As I'm waiting giving the death stare, the girls don't say excuse me at a crowded bar and one mumbles bitch. Awful service prob due to lack of leaders and teamwork.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Apr 12, 2019~Drive thru only had 5 cars but took 20 minutes. Slooooooooooooooooooow. `"Thanks for your patience`" does not cut it for a company that used to be known for customer service
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Feb 23, 2020~A lot of people come in to do their work here. The staff and manager are amazing, they greet you when you come in. 10/10 recommend. Not other Starbucks I been to makes you feel so comfortable.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 25, 2020~I asked for a warm banana nut bread and this is what I get. Still packaged, and cold! Wtf!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jun 28, 2019~I Stop by this store almost daily because my coffee is always so perfect ! Love love love !!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~May 29, 2019~I love Starbucks, I mean who doesn't. It's not the drinks that is the problem it's the location. Not well kept, tables are sticky &amp; stained, staff are slow &amp; not well trained. Messes up my order, 2 times in a row. 2nd time at this location, not recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jun 24, 2021~The coffee and service is consistently average but this store is always dirty/disorganized. It's pretty standard affair for the trash cans to be over flowing, stock/boxes to be piled up in the lobby, the tables to be dirty, and your shoes to stick to the floor. If it wasn't a convenient location I'd probably go else where.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Oct 3, 2018~Typically wouldn't rate a Starbucks but the amount of locations I have gone to, this one happens to be the best. The employees are the nicest people ever. They always make my drinks right and are pretty fast!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Oct 3, 2018~My favorite location! The baristas are always friendly and take the time to get to know me, my children, and even my dog! My drink is always made to perfection and the drive through is so convenient for this mama of four!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 26, 2021~The guy at the drive thru with purple hair is super condescending and had an attitude. Also tried to correct me on the order I have had for nearly a century. Please correct him or just do not have him interact directly with customers. Thank you.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 31, 2023~So we were told when my fiancé and I ordered that they did not have the cookie crumble for the drinks we wanted. We agreed that was fine and ordered them any way. Pulled up to the window and paid like normal and while waiting for our order I happened to be holding my fiancés hand and leaned over and gave her a couple kisses. Nothing out of pocket or over PDA at all. When the manager brought our drinks to the window we were asked that if we returned to the store to not have display of affection as they have minor employees that are uncomfortable. I returned with a this has to be a joke right and was meet straight faced with a no it's becoming an issues lately and my management has asked me to tell people who are displaying affection to please not. What in the safe space is this country coming to. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location or possibly Starbucks all together. Disclaimer it would only let me post if I have them a star rating but negative stars are not an available option.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Dec 24, 2020~This Starbucks is by far the worst one I've ever been to. I only come here cause it's across the street from home. The drive thru always takes forever. Even when there are only 5 cars but, but 6 employees working. Also, EVERY. SINGLE. TIME we order food, they say they are sold out. I once tried to order 3 food items, and each one was completely sold out. I'm not sure what the odds are of everything being sold out all the time. The girls that work here are very nice, so i feel bad writing this, but i had to be honest. I've been coming to this Starbs for over a year.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 9, 2018~I frequent this location because it is closer to work and home. Even tho the one barista Tarak moved on to another job, I still remain having baristas who know my order and make it right. From Angie, Amy, Jacob, the manager Kristie, the super tall guy with a bandana and this one other small girl her name starts with an L. They are the best!! I love to come when they are working they always have a smile on their faces, are friendly, they know me by name too. They are what keeps me coming they are friendlier than the evening crews. Ohh and on Monday my boss bought drinks and Angie knew the drink was for me. She is such a sweetheart.. made my day.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 28, 2021~Literally go anywhere else.. they're really giving out food that expired TWO MONTHS AGO. the customer service response was a joke- they don't care.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 14, 2022~The other day i went into this Starbucks location and i wanted a simple unsweetened ice tea. Taylor that took my order had complete attitude! super unprofessional and disrespectful, The other barista Abby gave me my order and completely gave me the wrong drink! The tea was so sweet i almost went into cardiac arrest!!! I went back and told them that this wasn't what i asked for and they both laughed at me and called me `"a fat old lady that has memory loss`" and tried to say i messed up my own order and told me if i want a new drink i would have to pay again. So i did, and i pretty sure they SPIT in my drink!!! how disgusting especially during covid? i should sue to be honest. This isn't my first bad experience at this location and i hope theses two girls get fired immediately.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 21, 2021~Paid for a cup of milk when I thought I ordered a flat white. The inconsistency at this Starbucks has really fluctuated over this past year. I don't know how it's acceptable to serve a milk drink when I thought I ordered coffee. Disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Mar 17, 2020~I like how I got a drink the other day with a joke written on it. That's adorable. Keep it up. It definitely brightened my day. Also, Isaac Hyslip is my favorite barista. He's always polite and more than that, he's consistently friendly and positive every time I go there. Keep up the good work ya'll.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 5, 2018~Very slow service you would think only 1 person works here and then you find out they have a whole crew of baristas. I think I waited in drive thru line for 20 minutes.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~May 22, 2017~Just very slow, I understand making the drinks but when I go up to window it's really quick. Too many people want to work here but don't want to work
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Feb 22, 2018~Nice large outdoor patio, good service. Large inside area also. Busy Thunderbird road makes it a bit difficult to hear each other outside but it's hard to be inside during the springtime weather in Arizona. Drinks were made to perfection. Drive through here is always busy so allow some time. Service with a smile, Starbucks drinks and Arizona sunshine, come on, what's not to like?
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Feb 15, 2018~Large patio with comfortable chairs you enjoy a well prepared drink of choice in the Arizona sunshine.  Friendly, hospitable staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 5, 2019~Starbucks is starbucks is starbucks, as far as the menu is concerned. This location though probably has the best vibe of any of the cafes that I have been in. The employees are really nice and they have been quick in all of my experiences. I usually go through the drive thru but it was too busy the last time so I went in. Glad I did.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 9, 2021~This place is infested with flies. You can't sit down without 5-6 flys swarming around you and landing your drinks/food. Not only is it annoying, it's also a health hazard. I don't understand why they don't do anything about it.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 7, 2022~I went yesterday and not only was a charged for a bento when I ordered a grande she also put a tiny bit of caramel when I asked for all over the cup but whatever so I came back today and asked for a caramel iced coffee and I thought I tasted kind of off so I look at the sticker on my cup says vanilla...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Apr 24, 2015~Came through the drive-through to get my regular iced coffee with white mocha and a cool lime refresher. I noticed that there was cones blocking off the drive-thru but continued to the window anyways, where I was informed that there was a nationwide --actually I was informed by the staff that it is worldwide-- system shutdown of some sort.  They were unable to accept payment but the Barista, Maximo, was so kind and gave me a free iced coffee for me and my mom. My poor little mommy has never had their iced coffee, 2% milk with white mocha pumps. She was chugging her coffee faster than me, lol... We both approve.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 15, 2021~Terrible service today just left over charging me I will not be back to this location ever again and they're out of straws for the right size of cups giving us a small straw for a big Venti cup
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 27, 2018~Nasty dirty table.  No wonder we have a flu epidemic in this country!  It's too bad Starbucks has gone so down hill. Filthy seems to be their new norm.  Bummer.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jun 25, 2019~They welcome people when they come in. Very nice staff and quick service. Lots of tables and chairs to sit with 4 lounge chairs and outdoor seating available also. They have a drive thru and plenty of parking next to a mini strip mall- specifically Sally Beauty Supply. It's one of the nicer ones I've been to.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Mar 2, 2019~This Starbucks has really great employees who usually do well handling drive thru orders with speed and diligence, they're also polite and strike up casual conversation while you wait for drinks/food.  The only downside about this location is the drive thru. It wraps around the building and when it gets busy, people cut each other off to get in the drive thru line while blocking the exit. I wish this location would be remodeled to have a better flowing drive thru line!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Aug 26, 2012~I have a love-hate relationship with this Starbux. For a long time it was my absolute favorite place in the valley. To come and read, study, have coffee with a friend ... It is spacious, nice, great atmosphere. Then they started hiring some slow, pretentious morons and it all went down the drain. Lines at the register and drive thru were annoying beyond description. At the same time a lot of people started coming there and on weekends it is almost impossible to find an empty chair. On top of everything they crank up AC that you literally freeze if sit longer than 30 minutes. Well that's the bad. But it is still best place for casual coffee date in the area. It is never dull or boring and atmosphere is always uplifting enough.Update;The new stuck up management can suck it. I'm not pain in the ... about customer service usually, but when newly hired shift supervisor comes to a customer that comes every day (multiple times) for years and says if he leaves tea bag on the floor again (it happened maybe 2-3 times, better than on the tables I would say) she won't serve him again, then I have problem with that. It happened to a friend, I was present and the rudeness and attitude she gave was just disgusting. I'm writing a complaing for this one for sure!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Sep 1, 2021~Love the location. Love the drive thru and how quick it is. Always nice. Starbucks is low key expensive but still so yummy. Very clean and had a really nice sitting area indoor and outdoor. Good to do your work because of the fast and free wifi. Highly recommend this location!! Favorite one by far AND to add on it's the only location that closes at 11pm rather than 8pm like all the other locations. Good for a late night starbies run!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Oct 16, 2014~So I was skeptical to come here after reading some of the recent reviews, but I found the baristas really friendly. She greeted me with enthusiasm and she was in the middle of making my drink (vanilla bean frap) when she came to get the payment and I asked her if it has the same amount of caffeine as mocha frap.She told me vanilla bean frap has no caffeine (whoops). She then told me if I want something to taste like that but with caffeine, I should get the cafe vanilla. She offered to remake my drink even though I said no and didn't want to put her through the trouble. She insisted saying I want you to enjoy your drink so I let her and I actually do enjoy my drink.I like this place- long hours, spacious with plenty tables and comfy leather chairs. They have outdoor seating too :)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Mar 4, 2019~After trying a disappointing new Starbucks location recently, I just have to give this one the excellent rating it deserves. I only knock off one star because the lines can be long &amp; parking is not ideal in this location. But the employees are wonderful, the place is comfortable &amp; welcoming &amp; in all our years coming here the service has always been accurate &amp; fast...never a problem.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Oct 2, 2013~`~*After a girls lunch and shopping, you want a drive thru Starbucks!*`~We drive up and I tell my mom my order literally, 3 times (grande java chip frappachino) and she's still like...a what? So when it's time to order she tries to say it but starts laughing.  We end up laughing really hard.  Finally she composes herself and manages to say `"a granda`". Which makes us laugh more.  The Starbucks girl adds in `"a granda???`" So funny.  Eventually I order my drink and then she gets an equally complicated drink (hot grande skinny toffee nut latte)!This place has down to earth employees and the girl that works when my mom goes in the morning always goes to extra mile!!Our drinks were perfectly crafted and we had no wait at all in the drive thru. I wish this was closer to my home/work but I usually go to the Starbucks on 24th st and camelback or 16th st and Bethany.  Both are decent but the drive thru on 16th can be hit or miss.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jun 19, 2019~Coffee is coffee and tea is tea. But when you have Nick working the drive thru you get the best service, laughs, and some awesome drinks! Thanks for making me and my best friend laugh yesterday Nick! We will be back to see you!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Jun 10, 2016~Typical Starbucks, though maybe a little roomier than most.  Good table for laptop time.  Otherwise same normal not-so-great coffee but good and friendly service.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~May 10, 2019~The store was clean, and they had my stuff ready quickly. The staff was very pleasant. My only complaint was that the restroom smelled like cat litter... Not sure why...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~May 5, 2016~Even when it looks like there is a long line, they are pretty quick! Everyone is always friendly at this location. It's my daily go to location!! The drive thru could have been a little more organized when they originally built it, but hey it's still a great place!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Mar 13, 2019~I have to say that this Starbucks location has been a disappointment. We tried it during a busy afternoon two days ago and they lost our drink orders resulting in a wait of over half an hour. Then this evening we decided to try again. It was supposed to be open until 11pm, but was closed before 9pm.  We won't be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 3, 2018~If I could give them zero stars I would. It's Saturday morning and the level of clientele is moderate (inside), but Aubrey decided to take our order and walk away to make food for the drive-thru customers. Feeling only half satisfied, Aubrey would not let us pay, while a line of 9 disgruntled patrons began to pile up and ask questions. Then the girl making most of the drinks (a saint from heaven, name unknown) was directed to make our drinks (we still haven't paid for). With plenty of time to think about the drinks we just ordered from Aubrey, we decided to make one bigger, so we told the saint from heaven about the well thought out upgrade. With my card in my hand ready to pay, another employee decided to take our order again, and Aubrey intercepts the employee so we could tell her our order again, and the saint from heaven mentions she is already making the drinks. Out of nowhere, Aubrey decided to cough up some unnecessary attitude, to the point where my boyfriend lightly sang to her `"why you gotta be so rude.`" Her Starbucks teammate openly laughs as Aubrey looks sickened by the oh so true lyrics.Also, another time we waited 35 mins on a Wednesday around 2:30 to get our coffee, so I emailed corporate with no response. Please BLACKBALL this terrible MONOPOLISTIC corporation. SUPPORT LOCAL
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Apr 10, 2018~For the most part the employees are nice. This location though runs out of a lot of things. Once I was there at 9am wanting a bagel and they were all out of cream cheese. If you come late afternoon, the majority of the lunch sandwiches are sold you.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 24, 2018~The baristas here is what makes this Starbucks great! They all go out of their way to ensure every customer feels welcome.  Vanessa and miles make the day with their smiles and bubbly personalities.  I love it here
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Apr 11, 2015~A nice modest-sized standalone store, this place could stand to be twice the size given the constant volume of business from early morning well into the night. Staff is consistently, courteous, and though everyone behind the counter always seems to be in a blur of motion  there's always a little wait but nothing extraordinary.  If you really NEED it faster you're probably consuming too much caffeine anyway.  If you want it faster go to Circle K,  pour your own for a fraction of the cost and you're on your way, but if you  or a few ahead of you at SB want one of those hand-mixed custom-made caramel masochist things - expect to wait a little. Overall a satisfactory representation of the Starbucks experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 28, 2015~This is one of those times I wish you could give a zero star rating. I am so done with this location. Practically every time I go they take forever in the drive-through, they are rude, and usually my drink is wrong. Tonight was no exception. Granted it was 25 minutes before they closed however with only one car ahead of me why should I have to wait eight minutes before getting to the window. Then when I get there, they haven't even started my drink (yet somehow miraculously have three other drinks ready to be delivered at the window). And then I realize I just paid $3.19 for a glass that's 80% filled with ice. I think they just invented a new drink `"hint of green tea infused water.`"The straw they gave me broke the camels back. I'm never coming back to this location. You probably shouldn't either.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Aug 20, 2015~I've never had any problems with this location. Most of the bad reviews say that it took forever to get a drink, but I've never had a problem with that. If it's going to take a while, like if they need to do a pour over, they always warn me in advance. I come in here all the time to use their wifi and chill out for a few. I'm giving them 4 stars as opposed to 5 because their tables are always a little dirty and sticky, but this location is always very busy so I am cutting them some slack.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jul 27, 2014~I am a customer who goes to Starbucks EVERYDAY.  I have been doing this since I was 20 - so its been over 20 years.  I moved to Arizona 3 years ago and there are two Starbucks closest to my home, though I travel all over the state and experience various Starbucks.  This particular Starbucks gets the majority of my business.Sadly, the customer service here is horrible.  There is never a time you do not have to wait..either in the drive through or if you go inside.  I am not against a business being busy, thats good news for all of us in business. However, it is terribly frustrating when your standing in an endlessly long line and there are three employees gathered by the door that goes to the back room sipping coffee and talking about when they should take breaks, what they did last night, what happened with the boyfriend and how much they are frustrated with other co-workers and their manager....A customer behind me finally stepped in and said `"do you work here?`" which all three replied `"yes.`".  Then they went on talking.  The customer, who was an elderly lady, went on to say `"are you not suppose to help us? Do you do something else here?`" All three looked at her confused, then looked at each other and laughed out loud.This is my typical experience at this Starbucks.  There is a large amount of customers and a large amount of staff but the staff just don't seem to care about the length of the line and everyone who is waiting.  The customer service that historically Starbucks was known for has gone out the window and they have become the average business providing average service.  Which is unfortunate... I happen to coach people in training sessions and use to use Starbucks as an example - now I just can't do that.Here is the conversation I heard today while typing this... the person making the coffees at the front and the person who is supposed to make the coffee at the drive through stopped to discuss who was the slowest co-worker on the team.  They carried on for about 7 minutes about who they thought was the slowest and why they disliked working with those folks etc etc.  Meanwhile, no drinks were being made.I wish I could say that I won't go to Starbucks again.  My addiction, however, will not allow me to do that.  I am willing to drive the extra miles to a Starbucks that provides great customer service but I cannot give it up all together.I think Starbucks needs to go back to the basics and assure that the name they have made for themselves is saved before its too late.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Apr 6, 2011~Im so glad I can update my review of this place...Let me tell you all the past and what happened this past week.  My girlfriend and I always frequent Starbucks and this is one of the locations that she is a regular at.   Every day, if not twice a day, she comes here and will order a Venti Iced Caramel Macchiato, no ice (because she has sensitive teeth), skinny and mixed well.  What they do with no ice is that they add milk to fill it up.For almost 4 months now, she's never had a problem with that.  But this last week, after getting her coffee she noticed that her usual coffee was no $.75 more.  What??  When asking the girl behind the window to explain, she said that was for the few ounces of milk.  Last I checked, a gallon of milk was about $2.00.  So you're telling me for barely 3/4 of a cup, you are going to charge $.75?  WOW.She asked to speak to the manager, who you could tell loved being the manager of a Starbucks.. Oh the power.  She kindly mentioned that she was a regular customer and this is the first she's been charged for this. He rudely replied `"well we have to charge for milk since you dont want ice.  Do you want your coffee or not?`"  I wont say what i was thinking, but she did.. lol.  She said `"Ill take my damn coffee and never be back here again!`"  Seriously, every other Starbucks we visit and its probably 4 or 5 total,  have never charged to add milk.  In fact, she's such a regular that they usually start making her drink when she walks in.Was it worth it Starbucks on 43rd??  Get a new manager who actually is nice to the customers.  Im done.  NO wonder this place has horrible  reviews.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 6, 2011~Im not judging this on the coffee at all.. this 2 stars goes to how slow this place is. I was once in the drive-thru for 20min..  when we pulled up, they gave us the coffee for free.  Ever since it seems I average 10min per visit.  That's hella long. TIP:  If you are going in the mornings before work. DO NOT use the drive thru...  go inside, it's much faster.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~May 1, 2011~Driving 4 miles out of my way to go to THIS Starbucks. Why? Because THIS Starbucks is Larger, more table tops for homework, and open MUCH later than many of the Starbucks in the surrounding area.I believe this was some sort of old Fast Food restaurant before... you can tell because the bathrooms are totally.... crappy :)AND it is true what is written in some of the other reviews- this place spends a large fortune on the A/C... Brrrr! You can go sit in their outdoor area but there are misters out there and they will turn your pages all wavy. I say, bring a Northface and tough it out!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~May 17, 2012~I'm surprised that this location hasn't gotten better reviews. I go to Starbucks EVERY DAY (ha! sometimes twice!). So I've been to many different locations around the valley. This one, by far, is the best.First of all, I've only had the best experiences as far as customer service. Even when I make outlandish requests, they're always super nice.But the most important reason is that it has a different atmosphere from the other ones. It's open and airy and spacious with lots of light, and good indoor and outdoor seating. I love the 4 person desk they have in the middle - very clean, minimalist, with blue globe hanging lights. This is where I come to do my work. I've tried other Starbucks locations, and it's just not the same - I can't really seem to get into being able to do work for long periods of time. Yet I keep searching for one that's similar.If any of you know of another location like this one, by all means, let me know!Update:  This location no longer has my favorite 4-person desk worksace. Boo!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Apr 6, 2015~How long does it take to get a hit beverage? This place is dead to me. Can't ever get anything right and then when they do it is soooooo slow.This is the most convenient location to me but I'm not going there anymore. Done and done.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 16, 2017~I love this location thunderbird and 19 they no my name as I come in love them love them awesome crew
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~May 16, 2020~Awesome starbucks to go to! Wish they had more tables because it does get busy and can be hard to find a seat. The wait isn't long, especially if you order ahead.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Aug 18, 2017~I love coming here. Staff are genuinely helpful and kind. Wifi is fast. Nice place to chill and do some work with your comp.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~May 3, 2019~this Starbucks is really close to my house and I go here every morning. One thing I found out is to never order in person. The girls never know how to ring up the correct prices or drinks. They over charge you for everything due to them not knowing how to ring up the order correctly. And then they try to kill anyone who's lactose-intolerant because they don't listen to what you order and they try to put actual milk into your drinks. I have to sit there and watch them make the drink just to make sure that they're not going to put the wrong milk in due to the cash register girl bringing up the wrong type of milk. And then when I say something about it I have customers getting mad at me. IMy gut health is not up to you to decide whether or not I should just let it be. so if you do need to order from the Starbucks order through the mobile app so you're getting the correct pricing and the correct drink order. Still double-check it just in case some idiot behind the register decides to mess it up again.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jul 10, 2014~This has been my favorite Starbucks location for a number of years. However, my recent visits have left me feeling frustrated and wondering why I ever liked it so much. This is mainly due to the customer service. This morning I went through the drive thru. My baked item had not been warmed, and the woman in the drive thru never gave my total. She took my card and I don't even think she made eye contact.The lines inside are forever long, no matter what time of day, and I've experienced baristas complaining about their jobs while people at waiting for drinks to be made. Great atmosphere, very poor customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jul 8, 2017~This is my go to Starbucks when in town. It's big, clean, and friendly. It can take a while to get your drink but that's because it is always crazy busy and the lines are forever long. They move quickly and efficiently though, and I've never had to send one back. Mobile order is definitely a god send..
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 31, 2017~Just don't go. Long wait, terrible service, they served the 3 orders in back of me and only when I complained did they start on my 1 chai!! And, the chai tastes watered down! Terrible, terrible!! Go to McD's across the street. Not worth it!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Feb 16, 2019~The baristas are very friendly. I was looking for a Starbucks that was open late. This store is always crowded.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Dec 25, 2012~Love this Starbucks location!  I have been a customer of this location for over 6 years.  I am always greeted with a cheerful barista and my drinks are always correct.This is a very busy location.  Kudos to the employees on cranking out the drinks, even when the lobby is full and cars keep lining up in the drive through.  I appreciate the smiles and pleasantries even when you are under pressure.I have to say that I LOVE the new improvements to this location.  The lobby is much more spacious and modern than before.  So much easier to use my laptop with the new tables, and the chairs are so comfortable.  It's so nice to relax with friends while enjoying the new, upscale renovation.Thank you for brightening my day baristas, especially Alyssa!  You are always a ray of sunshine.  This location is the best!  Keep up the good work and yummy drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Feb 10, 2010~So, I study at coffee shops a lot.  A whole lot.  I've gotten to the point that I feel that I'm getting a little uppity about what I expect in a caffeine shack that I'm going to be sitting, wholly immobile except for my eyes, for hours at a time.  Realistically, I can deal with blah service.  I can deal with less than amazing coffee.  I can even deal with a little bit of a mess.  But there are two things about this starbucks that absolutely drive me nuts.First off, the place constantly looks dirty.  And I mean dirty to the point that I'd prefer to not put my book bag down because I'm worried what it might come into contact with while it's down there.Secondly, the place has either the most powerful AC unit in AZ or it's completely possessed.  There are constant waves of hot, then cold, air that pass through this place.  You have to take your sweater on and then off again in the space of 5 minutes.  A deal breaker?  No.  Annoying as all get out?  Very much so.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Sep 19, 2014~Drive through takes way too long.The staff is rude and unwelcoming.The amount of coffee you get for the price is terrible.There are so many better choices when it comes to coffee! I'm just glad I had a gift card because I wouldn't spend my own money at (this) Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Apr 24, 2014~I usually do the drive thru and they are usually pretty fast even though they are packed crazy busy all the time.  I'd recommend the drive thru and not walking in as when I do go inside I feel I'm waiting longer then when I'm at the drive thru.It's expensive yeah, but what trendy coffee shop isn't over priced.  They all are, get over it.  If you don't like it then buy some Fry's coffee and make it yourself at home and quit your whining about the prices.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jun 19, 2017~There was a big bug in my drink. They offered me no compensation for the time I had to turn around and go inside the store. They gave us replacement drink and wanted me to shut up so it seemed. I also used free drink reward for one of two drinks my husband I got. They did not tell me what new total was and did not even ask if we needed receipt. So we came home with no receipt.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 22, 2017~This is the slowest moving Starbucks I have ever been to! Waiting in the drive through for over 15 minutes with 2 cars in front of me. I can understand a big order but come on people get it together!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Dec 7, 2017~This is my go to Starbucks! I use mobile order and it's always ready when I need it! Their evening team tends to be a bit slower than their morning team but  that's when their peak is so it's as to be expected! Any time they always get my order right though and everyone I've met working there is friendly and happy! The atmosphere is filled with fresh light making it feel spacious and open, they have a great patio too!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Apr 30, 2016~My wife and I were wanting to get a specialty frap but we did not want to stand in line so we chose to order using the mobile app$pay. We sent the order in at approx. 5:10 pm on a Saturday, not the busiest time at Starbucks from what we have already experienced. We intentionally waited for a time when they would be able to process our order in a timely fashion. We gave them an extra ten minutes before arriving to pick them up, hoping to walk in and grab our order without more than a name as we have been able to do at other locations. In fact we chose this location over 19th &amp; T-Bird because we felt like they usually give us better service at 43rd, that was a mistake. After 25 minutes of sitting politely at the waitbar, I finally wandered in front of the coffee bar and had to really be a pest to get eye contact.This is a vastly different experience than what Starbucks would like to be training for. I felt like even after I was looked at, I had to clear my throat, say 'excuse me' or do something to warrant attention from the baristas. I really enjoyed Tarek, who is clearly an off duty employee, held the short female barista's attention daftly for ten minutes while my order sat there unmade, while she made Tarek's two cups of coffee and chatted him up like it was am ice-cream social. I was chuckling as the empty cups with our names on them being passed over to serve customers who were ordering presently. At this point my order was over 30 minutes on the clock and still not delivered. I guess the online ordering thing is just not worth it. I should have stood in the line and waited for Mother Starbucks to decide when I was worthy for my coffee.  Sadly disappointed because the service there has not been this bad before. Probably will pass it on the way to Arrowhead or back down to 19th.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Nov 8, 2019~This is quite literally the slowest Starbucks I've ever been to and the service in general leaves much to be desired. Nothing wrong with the actual product though. My advice: work on getting your drive through moving. It is a terrible idea to have the drive through take 15-20 minutes to get through.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Nov 8, 2017~I picked out my favorite sandwich from the case (price $3.75). I get to the register and order. it rings up for MORE than the advertised price on the printed sign in the display case.I bring this discrepancy to the attention of the cashier and she tells me basically, too bad, the price I will be charged is whatever is in the register system.Then 2 more of her colleagues chime in and basically say the same thing (with no apology, and with a tone attempting to make me feel like I am in the wrong for EXPECTING to be charged the advertised price...)To compensate me for the added charge, you'd think they would:1. Apologize (at the very least)2. Adjust the price to reflect their POSTED price3. Offer a free brew coffee4. Call a manager***NONE of these things happened.***They sent me on my way in disbelief of the atrocious business practice of 1) Charging MORE than their clearly-advertised price and; 2) Having a poorly-trained staff and no process in place for when a something like this happens.These staff members truly had zero interest in whether they were providing an exceptional (or even ACCEPTABLE) customer experience.Shame on your Starbucks at 43rd ave and Thunderbird in Phoenix.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Nov 6, 2017~Darien was awesome! He was so nice and friendly! I will definitely be back at this Starbucks. They were fast and efficient!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~May 19, 2019~Every time I go to this Starbucks they're always super nice and excited to help. It's always enthusiastic when answering the speaker in drive thru and just happy in general. I once spilled my drink when putting it in the cup holder and they replaced it for me even though it was my mistake. By far my favorite Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 25, 2019~The online mobile portion of this store is the worst of I think all the stores almost every single time I have ordered via mobile app I have had to wait for them to make my order. 2 of 5 times if I would have just went thru the drive thru I would have been there and gone before I even would have gotten my online order. Then when you asked where or when your drinks are going to be ready the either get upset or act like they have just been hit by a mass wave of business and the store is not even busy (not customers in line - everyone seated) super disappointed with this Starbucks. Enough benefit of doubts I won't order from this Starbucks again average wait time after online order time an additional 15 mins
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 19, 2019~Really nice place. Food is good very friendly, we come here a lot. Here is a lot of good restaurants and places around this shopping center
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 15, 2017~Sooo slow and disorganized. Ordered two drinks and it took 15 minutes just to get to the window 3 cars ahead and when we got there only one drink was ready. I'd avoid this location
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Sep 28, 2016~Nice place. Always clean. Friendly staff and usually fast considering there's a never-ending stream of cars in the drive-thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jul 7, 2016~Nice place. Always clean (including the bathrooms). Staff is friendly, I think. Some are enthusiastically friendly and glow. Others are friendly, but working too much to give that glow. It's a busy place.There are some cushy chairs in one corner, but I usually opt for the long table. Perfect for working in small groups, with another person, or just chatting with whoever is sitting around. Even the customers seem nice (not that I've met all of them). It's better to park in the big lot than try to get in the few spaces along the driver-thru part of the building. Say 'hello' if you ever see me there! I'm always ready for good conversation with friendly people.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Feb 24, 2017~And again,It doesn't look that great from outside, but it's pretty nice on the inside with multiple choices of where to sit/different type of  chairs. They have big comfy chairs, the long tables, high top tables, outdoor seating, and some seats with counter space by the 'pick up' station. There's basically unlimited extra parking to the west side of the building which is nice because there small lot fills quick when busy as well then it can be a pain to get in and out of. The baristas are friendly and helpful. The wifi hasn't been working for me at this location though. My drinks haven't been staying consistent and it's aggravating especially because I don't want to complain for them to remake it! I've been coming to this locations for a few years, and will continue to go. My drink that is consistently different is a peach green tea, a few extra pumps of peach, and light ice. Which I had today, and was totally different from ever before was almost like it had a splash of lemonade in it. Also had a protein bistro box which I get decently often along with other food items is why I usually go to Starbucks, and it was delicious with 0 complaints the last few times! Why does this location have 3 locations on here?? Well I'll put my review in each!

Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Feb 10, 2017~I like the look of the place, always very clean and friendly. But they are slooooow as molasses. I started ordering via mobile even if I plan on sitting there for a while just because it takes so long. Even then, they don't start making it until you show up. So don't come here if you're in a hurry.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 19, 2016~This place can't make a trenta a simple youth berry ice tea!? Unbelievable....when other Starbucks made them for me without a problem! Ridiculous...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Apr 9, 2016~This used to be my favorite Starbucks but lately I avoid it. I recently went inside to grab a quick iced coffee and it took 25 minutes.  They don't just pour quick coffee drinks like other stores. They put every drink in line for the one person making inside and drive thru drinks. The person working cashier could easily make the basic drinks and their turn around time would be significantly shorter.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Mar 10, 2017~Let me start by saying I am a huge starbucks fan. The location on 41st Ave and thunderbird is atrocious. They are super slow and the drive thru line takes forever!!! I seriously dread coming here, so I go out of my way most days to the location on 27th Ave and peoria. I am currently sitting In the drive thru and have been here 10 minutes now with only about 5 cars ahead of me. The line has not moved. I'm not sure if they are understaffed or they lack better management.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Sep 30, 2016~Great customer service. My coffee is always made the way I like it. Ryan is a very kind and happy barista always ready to take your order. My breakfast sandwich is always available and in stock. The store is clean and tables wiped down. The bathrooms are clean, alwats have toulet paper. The trashes always emptied. Drive thru is fast and never much of a wait. I appreciate this starbucks during my work weeks. Thank you for your service!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 26, 2015~I just went through the drive thru and when I got home both the drinks I got taste disgusting! One is completely watered down and diluted with milk and the other tastes like straight up burnt nastiness. I tried to call to see if they could make me new drinks and after 10 tries with absolutely no answer  (phone just rang and rang) I'm done with this crap so called coffee place. Stuff off Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 17, 2015~This location is right by my house. I find that the employees who work here are seriously the most pleasant Starbucks baristas EVER! And the drive thru line is fast unlike another location that I usually frequent.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jun 14, 2018~This is probably the worst Starbucks ever!  4th car in line and have been for 20 minutes.  Dear owner of this franchise, this is EXTREMELY unacceptable, and we personally will never come back!  It should NEVER take this long.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~May 14, 2016~This is not the quickest Starbucks, but they are very friendly. I like coming in and sitting while enjoying my coffee. The ambiance is nice. The drive thru is good at 5:40 a.m. Any other time, better to walk in and wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~May 13, 2018~While this is my 'home' store, I am constantly annoyed with this location. Nearly every week, I place a mobile order consisting of 4 drinks and 2 croissants. After the allotted prep time, more often than not, I end up waiting another 15 minutes before my order is ready; meanwhile, I've watched all the cars clear the drive-thru. Mobile ordering is certainly not a convenience at this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Sep 3, 2017~my fave starbucks place. the baristas are friendly and nice. it's located near near ASU west campus so it's a bit packed during the weekdays. overall, a nice go to place to chill and hangout with friends.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 25, 2017~Super super slow in the drive thru!!! Took 20 mins with 4 cars in front of me. Ordered a flat white but there was no foam on top. Won't be coming back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Nov 4, 2011~I have to say the Customer Service here is awesome...I love the drive through also...they are always so cheerful and kind
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jun 6, 2008~is today bad customer service day, or is it just me?cashier stood and gabbed FOREVER with some woman while a small line (including myself) just stood there. and waited. uhhh ok. and then after running my sbux card, asked if i wanted a receipt. `"no thanks!`" i said (and i was being nice today, too!). girl wouldn't take no for an answer, not sure why.... and started muttering (seriously!) about my account balance and i might need to refill my card, blah blah... yeah, i dunno. it was awkward and... weird. and really? why would i put more money on a gift card... for me?then barista boy. (yeah, this story isn't over yet) starts chatting with aforementioned `"some woman`" (who really needs to stop talking so people can do their jobs), and THEN bb starts making the drink of the guy who ordered AFTER ME. this is the rare occasion that it would have been faster for me to leave the starbucks, get in my car, and go through the drive thru to order my drink. (we all know how sbux drive thrus are...)and needless to say - the drink was crap. now, i know you coffee connoisseur's will say that sbux coffee is mostly crap. and to some degree - i will admit that sbux is not the best (oh, my poor seattle pride!). but this was exceptionally crappy. will not be visiting this location again. i'd like to take this moment to petition Peet's Coffee to start opening up locations in the valley......
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 14, 2014~Everyone that was there is gone ad it's gone downhill. I feel bad for the customers that have to wait over 20 minutes in drive thru because there are not enough employees there. So sad.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Aug 8, 2012~Best place ever and super awesome people working there. Busiest bux in the valley so might be a wait, but deal with it...it's not fast food. And who stops to get coffee when you're running late? Tip your baristas!!!! No it's not built in. ;)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Sep 9, 2014~It's pretty straight forward. THEY ARE THE SLOWEST STARBUCKS ON THE PLANET!!  Good coffee as always, but it seems like a 20 min ordeal each time to get my iced coffee!!  PLEASE SPEED IT UP.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Dec 30, 2010~Coffee is good , cashier nice but time in drive thru was way too long! 15 plus mins with only 4 cars ahead of me;( cashier comped my drink due to the wait time without me saying a word;)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Dec 23, 2014~Ugh this location is so frustrating. It's the only one on my long commute to work that's easy to get to. It's always busy but not for the right reasons. I can only speak for the drive thru but it seems as though there's only one person running the register and making the drinks. The other 5 employees are standing around. Guess that's why I never see the same person at the window for too long. They must hate being the only one who works and eventually quits. 3 times out of 5 my drink is wrong. For some reason they can't get a regular mocha and a white mocha straight. For me, Starbucks is a treat. I budget for one or two stops each month. So, I look forward to it. Unfortunately I haven't leaned I need to budget more time for it too because I can't usually wait for them to remake my drink. Terrible customer service too.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Mar 21, 2018~Ordered an iced decaf americano with soy. Pulled up, they handed me the drink and I noticed that it didn't say decaf on the label so I asked...they had forgotten. So, the cashier goes and dumps it out and remakes it and brings it over without the soy milk. When I say it was supposed to have soy, she says that she doesn't have any because she used the last of it in the one she just dumped out...
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Nov 16, 2014~The absolute slowest starbucks on the planet.  You will spend 20-30 mins most of the time just to get 1 drink.  This location needs a manager who manages.  Staff is also very unfriendly.  They make you feel like you're bothering them.   And half the time if not more, the drink isn't made right.  Too much milk, not enough ice, etc.  switched to 7st and bell and they are fast, friendly and drinks are right.  Went here tonight because I was in area, still slowest on earth, I just don't get why it takes just this location sooooo long.  Other locations can have 10 cars in drive thru and I'm out in 5 mins, this one can't handle more than one customer literally.  Hate this location
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jul 18, 2014~Ranked 3 busiest Starbucks in AZ! Cut them some slack people!! Always busy all day! With some good customer service what else do you want?! Yes the only bad is they take pretty long for a drink when you go inside but drive thru is fast.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 15, 2012~The Starbucks app shows that this location is open until 11pm and that is why I went out of my way to come with a friend here. Only to find out that it actually closed at 10:30 (according to the barista). As we walked up to the counter, the barista rudely barks at me `"What do you want?`" I was in shock. We quickly ordered our beverages and weren't even given an opportunity to order 1 of the 2 pastries out. Even if I had wanted to waste my breath and complain, no one seemed to care about anything else other than cleaning up. Very disappointing service coming from a Starbucks location.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 14, 2014~This is not only the worst Starbucks in the Valley but easily the worst Starbucks I've been to anywhere in the world. Corporate really needs to get some good management into this location. It IS possible to be busy while still providing friendly customer service and accurate orders. This location routinely does neither.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 29, 2016~This team is always on point and very personable.  I commute to work every day,  and this location is my favorite for the drive!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jul 14, 2012~I love this location! Friendly baristas, and I go there everyday (sometimes twice) as well! Yeah, the drive-thru is a little long, but there's usually some gorgeous eye candy guy behind the counter with glasses and a sexy smile, so why not just go in? :)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Jan 5, 2018~This place is always slow at serving.... i dont know if they are short staff or what what but everytime i come through the drive thru and even though theres only 3 cars in line it always takes me a good 20-30 minutes of wait.... wth, speed it ip people!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Mar 25, 2013~I love this place!!!! However, one thing that I am starting to dislike is the hours! They close really early on weekdays, at 10:00pm...come on guys, this is a place that is mostly used for people to do work and to study and closing at 10 is too early...most of us can't study at home because is loud and we rely on places like this to go study and it closes at 10??? IS THERE ANY STARBUCKS AROUND THIS AREA THAT CLOSES AT LEAST AT MIDNIGHT??? Im pretty sure that college students like me understand my schedule and with work and school we have to study at this time.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Mar 9, 2018~It was another pleasant trip through the drive-thru of one of my favorite places! This Thunderbird location is one of the best! They handle the zillions of car orders with prompt and friendly service. Beth was cheery and helpful as she created the masterpiece that is the Hot Chai Latte! Of course, I had to order the Bacon Gouda Breakfast Sandwich to complement my Grande beverage. With its delicious bacon and gouda cheese melted perfectly into the delicious frittata and artisan roll, it is an explosion of flavor of which I will never tire. Consider me a loyal customer, Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Oct 25, 2015~Great coffee and service as usual.  The customers here continue to amaze me with their idiocies!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Oct 3, 2015~Great service as always.  Amazing how ridiculous some customers act.  HELLO! The world doesn't revolve around you!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Sep 27, 2015~Love the coffee and service here.  My only complaint are the customers who think it's a playground for their kids and dogs
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Feb 20, 2015~The drive thru is usually busy. Don't think you'll beat the drive thru by going inside,  they cater to drive thru so you'll still have to wait just as long.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jan 23, 2015~Drive thru. Friendly batistas. Nice place to study or to just sit and enjoy your coffee. Difficult to make a left turn out of the parking lot, but other than that no complaints.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Mar 3, 2013~Love he drive through. If you do go inside the staff is super rad. They are knowledgeable and very fast. This is defiantly a busy store, so everything is always fresh! Great study spot. Free WIFI.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jan 16, 2018~I have been to many different Starbucks places and this one has yet to be the best one. Many other starbucks water down my drinks.The service is pretty good and fast. The employees are very friendly and hard working. The employees keep the line moving and never sound rude when they take your order.After the employee takes my order they get right to making my drinks. They also don't price as much as other Starbucks do. The amount of time usually spent there is about 20 minutes or so. I also love the fact that they can usually make all the secret menus. They have a great amount of varieties as well.  This Starbucks is a very nice and clean everything is well organized and set up correctly.This location gives a very calm and soothing vibe. It's a great place to come and relax after a bad day or simply just to get some peace. Also it is a very welcoming place and I love being here. I recommend this Starbucks to anyone that's tired of watered down drinks and bad service.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~3~Aug 29, 2013~Happy to report I have since been to this Starbucks (twice) and can say it has been a much better experience in the drive thru and inside. :)
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~May 5, 2012~Let me start with 1 star is too much. THE WORST COFFEE SHOP IN THE WORLD.Subpar drinks. AWFUL customer service. Slow slow SLOW!!I've seen lobsters crawl faster than that place. I will drive 10 miles out of my way and still get my coffee before this place. AND it's dirty. So long..
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 25, 2014~Honestly, the only reason I come to this location is because of how close it is to my house but I think I'll have to be finding a new location. My boyfriend and I waited 3 minutes at the order window after being told it would be just a moment, and then another 15 minutes to get our drinks with one vehicle at the pick up window in front of us. Once we got to the window, I got my tea and we had to wait an additional 3 minutes for our fizzio. No apologies for the wait. Unfortunately, I've found that this has become characteristic of this location. As far as the drinks go, my chai was good as usual, but we would not recommend the fizzio. It's not terrible but it does have a bad aftertaste. One star is because customer service really does make or break the experience, and this location seriously lacks quality service. I still love you though Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jul 15, 2017~Absolutely 0   Ok, this is the last time I come to this Starbucks! Every time I come here I have to repeat my order the way I want it a million times very poor listening skills the coffee is on the lighter side if you want stronger coffee taste you have to pay extra and when they don't make the coffee as you asked manager won't do a thing to make it right second worst Starbucks ever
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Feb 6, 2014~Stopped off at this location thinking I could walk in and get a real quick drink. Needless to say that didn't happen. I wouldn't have written this review just based on how long it took them to make my tall green tea latte, but I am writing this based on the fact that I had to wait for over 15 minutes for my drink and they served their `"regulars`" before me. I didn't see a VIP line there but apparently at this location they have an imaginary one. They served a gentleman who walked in after I had already placed my order and was waiting for 5 minutes. On top of that there were approx 5 people working at the time and only 1 girl was making the coffee, the rest were laughing and hugging and goofing around. Finally I asked how much longer and apparently they lost my cup with my order on it. If I didn't ask they wouldn't have even noticed that I hadn't received my drink yet. You'd think that because it was their fault they'd offer to comp my drink, but no. I work in the restaurant industry and this right here was just down right poor customer service. Don't know how corporate would feel about this.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 13, 2014~This is a very busy starbucks especially because of the drive thru, I've been going here for years but this is first time I'm leaving a review. Service has always been good and baristas pretty friendly, prompt and knowledgeable. AJ served me the other night and I have to say what a great guy and barista. He was so down to earth and professional at the same time. Kudos to AJ and his great customer service!!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 20, 2014~I go to this Starbucks all the time because it is so close to my house and let's face it I'm kinda addicted to their coffee! I usually go on my way to work (around 10am) and sometimes don't leave early enough and the line is particularly long so what do I do? I don't go! Because then that would just be my own fault if I went in and thought it was slow because hello! It's the morning at Starbucks, and this is the busiest one in the valley.That being said I think they do an amazing job! Most people there I encounter are very friendly and have great recommendations!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 16, 2017~Worst Starbucks on the planet.  I will never come here  again.  I will drink coffee from a vend machine before I come back.  I kid not folks get a coffee anywhere else please.  First, I used to come every day my usual is drink venti iced toffee nut latte.  If I go through the drive thru it is a minimum 25 minute wait.  My shots are always expired.  Most of the time they do not have venti straws.  The other day I ordered 6 drinks and was told after the drinks were made they had no cup holders.  I only have 4 cup holders in my car.  The barista offered to put them in a bag.  They spilled of course, out $11.00 for drinks and $50.00 for detailing.  Today, I went inside because the drive thru was so backed up it caused unsafe conditions.  I knew I should have just gone to the Starbucks in Albertsons.  I waited 30 minutes inside to be told that they were out of toffee nut syrup and out of whole milk.  I wanted a refund but the line was so long that I did not have another 30 minutes to wait for my money back.  Get some decent baristas, get some supplies, and get a grip.  I don't usually post bad reviews but this shite takes the cake.  P
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~May 13, 2013~Disorganized! Service slow. Hot drinks were not hot.  This used to be one of the best Starbucks around. What happened?
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Feb 19, 2014~My favorite Starbucks location.  Staff aways polite and friendly.  Clean with lots of space.  It's very convenient and easy to get in and out of parking lot.  Drive through gets me in and out in a hurry.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Aug 31, 2014~We spent literally 30 minutes in the drive thru and the line wasn't even long. To top it off our drinks were wrong! The barista barely apologized for the wait. And didn't apologize ... Not too mention it's not the Starbucks way of doing things. We still had to pay!! Never going to that location again!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Aug 29, 2016~There is an employee named Tarek ( I believe I am spelling that right) that has amazing costumer service. Very friendly and up going.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Aug 22, 2011~Ok people are way to hard on this Starbucks.  First off parking is tight but plenty of places to park if you don't mind walking some people still do this.  Be careful backing out of the spots on bias because people will cruise up to get in the drive thru line. The reason this Starbucks can be slow sometimes is this is the busiest one in Phoenix they compete with the one over at Shea &amp; 101 (I hear they go back and forth so just remember if you go to the busiest starbucks in the state you might wait). I go in here or drive thru here at least 5 times a week.  So ASU west is really close you have your study buddy thing going on, the hospital Banner Thunderbird is just past ASU west so these hospital folks come in.  Then half the people at the gym I go to go in here which is just down the way in the strip mall. The baristas do turn over pretty quickly in here but Bri who works in the morning knows me from my voice when I drive thru at 4 something in the morning on my way to work.  The other older ladies who work in the morning here are always nice.  The afternoons are your highschool/college baristas mostly....definitely some hotties.  There is a beautiful blonde who always wears this punk rock rasta belt gorgeous blonde hair wow she is worth going in here just to dump your coffee out at the door lol. I have gone and waited and also been through really quickly but every one is nice and given how busy they are most of the time I get what I want a strong ass cup of over roasted coffee in a hurry so I can deal with my life. So if you go here please take the aforementioned statements into account.  Also you know why I get in and out of here so fast..? I'm not a pretentious a$$hole I get a venti pike place roast......you coffee hipsters with your `"special orders`" really jam up the jerks who have written all the negative reviews about a really nice Starbucks. Thanks for reading.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~5~Jul 20, 2015~Today, we met the Coffee Master, and he was even wearing an apron that says, `"Coffee Master.`"  He revealed a secret coffee that is not really advertised at Starbucks... so here we go... (drum roll)...  It's the Americano Long Shot??  Shoot!  I think that's what it's called.  It's a coffee drink that will kick your bum!  Anyway, I didn't have it, but it sure is great to know they have it.  Aside from the great interaction with the team here, the customer service is really great!!  I like the layout of this Starbucks because it is spread out, and even when it's busy or crowded at times, you still feel like you're in a large space.  They have this long table in the lobby and I like sitting there cause the chairs are good for the back.  They have a decent size area for outdoor sitting and the ambiance overall is relaxing.  Thank you for the team at this location, you are all so very nice and professional, and I look forward to visiting this location soon.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Jan 28, 2015~This is the only drive thru starbucks in the area so that's why I've given them so many chances. .. but in the last 5 times I've been there, they've gotten my drink right once. Not only that,  when I tell them it's wrong the employees get an attitude. Bought a protein box and right before I opened it I realized there was hair on my apple. Pretty gross!
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Apr 28, 2013~5 stars for location! Woohoo! This is close by and convenient because it has a drive thru!  That is about where the stars stop! I have been tolerating the crappy customer service because of the convenient drive thru but today I decided that it just isnt worth it anymore.  The drive thru window opened and closed at least 5 times ...each time I could see my drink sitting there.  It looked sad and I am pretty sure I heard my iced vanilla latte calling out to me on the 4th and 5th try.  Finally a different person came to the window, no hello, no screw you....just a that'll be $4.86 (or whatever it was), I hand her the money, the window slams!  It opens again and finally she hands me my sad drink...no words.....I take my drink....WOW!  Never again!  I will go out of my way to the friendly Starbucks at Bell and 75th even though it is not nearly as convenient!  I am pretty sure `"Starbucks`" would be pissed if they saw you in action.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Aug 25, 2015~Makenize is awesome!!!!!! So friendly, we really enjoyed her customer service. I love the location and size of this Starbucks. It's a very busy location, so it can take a while to get your drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~May 4, 2013~I've never reviewed a Starbucks previously because, to date,I haven't needed to.  They are fairly consistent in delivering quick friendly service.  My experience at this store forced a review.  I walked into a store with two ladies ordering a drink and snack.  The guy at the counter proceeded to chatter relentlessly with them allowing a large line to form while he made small talk completely oblivious to my 10 minute wait and the forming line.  I am typically patient and quickly moved on to placing my order.  He then messed up my order.  I patiently informed him of this.  He tried again, asking my name and then called me by the wrong name with no real concern about getting it right....J-A-M-E-S....sound it out, not too hard.  Got past this to await my order.....wrong size.  Asked the apathetic/indifferent drink maker and she asked if I had a receipt....really?, my receipt?  I kept thinking maybe I'm on that show `"punked`".  Sadly no such luck.  This was an all too real example of how not provide customer service.  It would have made a perfect training video for any company trying to show examples of bad service.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~4~Jan 1, 2014~I've been to this Starbucks many times before and I know it switches on and off as being the busiest Starbucks in Arizona, probably because it's right next to ASU West. The staff is always very peppy and friendly. The only downside is that because it is one of the busiest, if you go at a peak time, you may end up waiting twenty minutes for your purchase.
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Jan 15, 2014~I want to start off saying that I have never had bad service there. BUT.... the drinks are hit or miss and I usually hit the drive thru in the morning around 5:30 and it is slow. Like if there are 2 cars I will keep going kinda slow. I notice that they take every ones order first then start making drinks WHAT!! `"Ain't nobody got time for that`"
Phoenix, AZ 85053~1~Oct 8, 2014~I will never go to this location again!  I am not sure if management has changed recently but let me tell you the customer service is horrible! The coffee is horrible! Don't even want to talk about the lines, If a business is that busy maybe they should have more help,or make sure the employees are actually working. I ordered my drink at the drive thru after waiting in a long line only to find they don't have an item to make my drink. This has happened on three occasions, I will go to the one on 43rd. ave. &amp; Cactus where the customer service is awesome and so is the coffee..
Phoenix, AZ 85053~2~Nov 29, 2014~I've been a loyal Starbucks customer for 8 years - we get 2-4 drinks in the AM and another 2 drinks in the PM so we definitely know our stuff.  This location used to be the best but in the last 8 months it has gone way way downhill!!  The staff morale, the quality of the service, the drinks, and the manager is the worst culprit.  She has lost many of the long term customers (fortunately it is across the street from ASU-West) and the turnover is crazy!!  No sooner do they get your drink perfect and then they're gone and another new person at the mercy of Kelly, the manager!!  I have sworn never to go back to this location but end up going back due to the convenience, but today was the last straw!!!  Rather than try to get the coffee right to the point of paying considerably extra, Kelley will argue with you over which way is the right way, not the way you want it!! If you can avoid this location, do so and maintain your beautiful morning!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 28, 2024~Every morning I stop by around 4:30 AM. They know my voice and they know my order. I truly love it. `"I can't say enough good things about Zack and Michelle at Starbucks! Their exceptional service, warm personalities, and genuine care for customers make every visit a delight. Whether it's Zack's attention to detail or Michelle's friendly smile, they both go out of their way to make sure every order is perfect and that everyone feels welcome. It's clear they take pride in their work, and it shows in the quality of service they provide. Starbucks is lucky to have such dedicated and amazing team members!`"
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 26, 2024~Went thru the drive-thru to get my niece a pink drink for her birthday and a cake pop! The girl was super nice and the drink yummy. Perfect.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 4, 2022~Stopped in after many months. Good news was they finally had the peach herbal tea. Unfortunately only open for pick up, drive through and no public restrooms.  Third Street and Bell Road is a better option.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Mar 5, 2021~Stopped in after a long hiatus, still busy pick up and drive through. Outside seating only. Coffee was hot so no complaints. Nice walk destination.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Nov 17, 2018~Yes....a Starbucks is a Starbucks but have been going here for 7 months. Impressed with the staff and their commitment to customer service and maintaining a quality product. It's a happy place.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 17, 2018~A Starbucks is a Starbucks. Have frequented this one for  several months as a morning walk destination. Place is clean, service is good and the coffee is hot.  They have a couple of low fat breakfast sandwich choices. These are ok...with enough Sriracha hot sauce anything is good. The pay card App gets you instore refills. The drive through is always full but they keep things moving. It's a coffee factory but a successful one
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 27, 2021~After getting a slushee at Quiktrip to cool off, I walked up cave creek road to find a very nice looking Starbucks.This property has a nice shaded patio and indoor seating is allowed.I was very impressed with Baristas Kade and Nick. These guys are professional, cordial and are fast and efficient with my drinks and were happy to add Venti ice waters with my coffees. I rank these two of the best Starbucks staff I've encountered.I got alot of work done and their hours are longer than most in the area.Highly recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 10, 2023~For some reason they close their lobby to people and I work for doordash, so i sat in their half hour line. The lady watched me walk to the door as she was locking it, then said `"yeah you can just wait in the drive thru`". As a doordash employee i'm not supposed to use drive thru's unless it's late and the lobby is closed due to HOURS, not in the middle of the day. I got there at just before 2 sign says `"Lobby closes at 2`", I've just never seen a starbucks do that, not a fan.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 29, 2023~Beware this place steals your credit card info. I haven't been to this location in (12days) and on the 28th from store 48148 (cave creek/bell)  I was charged a payment on my credit card. I've never ever had this happen ever in all my life. I always use my phone to pay. Last time I ordered a physical drink in my history was 20th which is correct. What's even more shocking never used my credit card to pay for my drink ever I my history. I don't think Starbucks has trusted security on their app so, for that nothing is saved in app. Here on out I'll scan my QR code and physical hand something. Unless baristas are stealing info themselves!!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 30, 2023~I ordered at 5:45 exact I was going to use my 50% off coupon they took so long I got to the window by 6:00. The guy was very rude since the start and told me the coupon wasn't available anymore and the guy snatched the money from my hand and closed the window while I was in the middle of telling him I did not want my drink anymore, he still charged me. Came back to me to give me the change and I told him again I did not want my drink anymore and he said `"well there's a trash can around the corner you can throw it away if you don't want it`" and I told him I wanted my money back. He got his supervisor and supervisor gave me my money back.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 5, 2022~If Jacee is at the counter or drive thru ask for someone else. The way she talks to customers is unreal, no customer service.  Worst &amp; most rude Starbucks employee I've ever encountered.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Sep 11, 2021~Besides the fact that they're out of countless items, they're customer service is lacking. You're pretty much screwed if you go inside to order at this location or use drive up. They primarily focus on drive thru customers, if you go inside to order you get to watch 4-5 cars receive their orders before you get yours. I just waited almost 15 minutes for 3 drinks. Oh &amp; they employees work like sloths which definitely doesn't help the situation.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 14, 2023~The drive through took forever and when I finally got to the window I asked about a 50% off deal in the app they were confused which one I was talking about so I tried explaining and she interrupted me and kept trying to explain they don't have it so when I showed her the app she went back and after a few moments came back and said I can do that for you. later my friend who got the drink looked at her app had a different deal taken off instead of the correct deal.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 18, 2022~Horrible customer service, always out of stuff, and just plain rude staff. Stay away for the place
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Sep 5, 2022~** No Inside Seating ** That was an instant turn-off. Drive-thru is open. Be prepared to sit in a line...for longer than you would want or expect from Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jul 25, 2022~This store has succumbed to the neighboring environment and will not allow inside sitting or restroom usage.  Then close the store or support the store needs to allow full service. Not customer service oriented.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Nov 8, 2021~I'm not a fan of this location's choice to have someone standing outside taking orders  with a tablet. The order taker stands 15 feet or more in front of the menu so you have no opportunity to look at the choices, you need to know what you want right away or you have to have a conversation with the order taker about it. I prefer to read menus, see the pictures and have a moment to order, as I don't always know what I want when I pull up. Especially since they change their menu frequently enough that I feel like I have to read the menu to make sure I know what is currently available. At the very least the order taker could stand next to the menu if they are going to keep doing this. Seems like they are copying Dutch Bros.... Not a fan. Might have to choose another location if they keep this up....
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Nov 18, 2021~I've never had an issue at this Starbucks before but today it was ridiculous. We show up and order our drinks (a chestnut praline latte and an iced peppermint mocha - no customizations) at 6:44 with two other people in the lobby who already ordered. We receive the first drink within 5 minutes or so and then we wait about 15 more minutes as they get the other two people out of the lobby but by then there's probably five more people, who ordered after us and still no drink. We see some people leave who ordered after us with their drinks and I go to the counter to make sure they got my drink. I was replied with it'll be out soon and she turned around and walked away. We wait another 15 more minutes before I go up a second time and tell them We've waited a total of 30 minutes for a single drink, and wasn't even replied with an apology from either employee and still had to wait another 5 minutes or so. They hadn't even touched our drink until I went up a second time and when I called to speak with the manager, she said what's the issue and I reexplained and then replied with well it's red cup day and there was a rush, even though I explained that we got there before the rush and was given a brief I'm sorry and that was it. I understand it gets busy but the lack of customer service they had will make sure we don't stop at this one on our morning runs anymore because we were to the point we just wanted a refund for our other drink so we could leave because we were both made late to work because of this.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Mar 22, 2019~Get your life together Starbucks. When someone asks for cream in their coffee, put it in. When someone asks for their croissant to be warmed up, warm it. Your job is not that hard. All you need to do is push buttons. Sincerely, A former Starbucks barista.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 21, 2022~This was the worst Starbucks! There was no seating inside so I bought my sandwich and coffee and sat outside. I went in to throw my trash away and asked where the restroom was and the guy told me there is no public restroom. WTF I am a paying guest. COVID is over it is here to stay move on!  I'll never come back.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 5, 2022~Seems to be a trend for bad customer service at this location. And I've witnessed it countless times. If it wasn't 2 minutes from my place I'd go somewhere else... had to have a drink remade (seems to be a trend too cause I guess making coffee is really hard) so I called ahead; got to the store there's one person in front of us and when it was our turn at the speaker we waited patiently for someone to come on until minutes go by and still nothing.. no `"hi I'll be right with you`" or `"sorry for the hold`" nothing. So I said `"Hello??`" And she finally came on. My partner told her why we were there about the drink needing to be remade and no response at all. So at this point we're getting frustrated so we just pulled up to the window. The window is open. There's really no one inside. One car behind us and nothing. The girl Her name is Jaycee? Was just standing there walking back and forth doing nothing. No one is coming to the window. She's still standing there and finally we said someone my partner asked `"is someone gonna acknowledge that I'm right here?`" And she laughed and said there's other people she's helping... who?? Lmfao and you really can't just say hi we're making your drink now... like the fucking window is open you're right there doing nothing! And the attitude on this girl. She should not be in customer service. So we asked for a manager ... I'm not a Karen but I was not gonna let someone talk to us like that when we spend a lot of money here. So Stacey came to the window we told her everything that happened. I told her I get being busy but at least communicate and acknowledge the person in front of you by simply saying something along the lines of `"sorry for the wait I'll be right with you`" or ANYTHING... so she said she'd talk to her and we asked for the employees name. Stacey tried saying she can't release that information ... I'm not asking for her last name and her address and schedule. I swear I want nothing to do with her I just want her name to report her to corporate cause she does not belong there. And finally Stacey told us her name is Jaycee. Which I have no idea if that's even her name. She looks really tall, kind of bulky. Shoulder length black curly hair dark skin and a RBF until she laughs that a customer is unhappy. Girl at best belongs at a Burger King scrubbing toilets. Doesn't have the attitude of someone who works at a Starbucks that usually has a reputation of good customer service. Called corporate though. They were more helpful and showed they cared and we'll see if something is actually done. Don't like dealing with people? Find a new job. And Stacey? You should probably too. Looks like your name is on here complained about a few times. Maybe we'll just start going to Dutch Bros where the customer service is always good and the drinks are decently priced and taste delicious every time.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 27, 2021~there was spit visible in my drink. just got home. feel sour. however the beverages, a mocha chocolate coffee, with whipped cream, that goood.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 4, 2018~Friendly employee in the drive thru. Order was correct and she was friendly and engaging.  Would stop thru again when in the area. Now if only it wasn't 9 million degrees here haha
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Dec 11, 2018~Great location nice friendly plp, always hot coffeeNice to see same plp they remember what u drink &amp; how u like it made service with a smile
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 24, 2022~This location shut down their bathrooms again. They also shut down their lobby so they could shut down their bathrooms `"by law`". When you ask why they simply repeat `"safety concerns`" and repeat it like a robot no matter what you ask. Do they really think they're all gonna get monkey pox or Covid if they let their paying customers sit inside and use the bathroom but they won't if they shut those down?? Oh boy. And if that's not the `"safety concern`" then what?? We don't know because they don't have enough respect for their customers to be transparent and truthful. Starbucks you really need to stop with the fear it's hurting your business. When did it become ok for businesses to do this stuff?? We are scared today so you can buy our food and drinks and give us your money but you can't use our bathroom cuz we're scared of everything  I just won't go to any locations where they take your money but shut down their facilities. It's not about safety it's about pushing fear and it's not stopping ANYONE from getting the sniffles.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 6, 2020~Incredibly frustrated with this Starbucks. I know times are tough right now, but this store needs to learn customer service etiquette. I was in the drive through line at 5:55 pm, waiting patiently, knowing they closed at 6. 4 cars entered before me and got their order taken. I was the last car in the drive through, it was 5:58 when the barista came on and said they were closed. I told her I've been waiting since before then and I was the absolute last car. She said If we don't close now we'll never close. Thoroughly confused as to how they'd never close when I was the last car and waited just as long as the four that entered before me. Just a tired mama that was trying to get her coffee after getting a break from the baby. Won't be using this location anymore.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 6, 2018~This is by far my least favorite Starbucks I've ever been to. I get a salted caramel frap every time. No special requests, so they should be able to execute it perfectly. I went the first time when they first opened in 2017. It was all ice, almost no flavor and very little liquid. I gave them a few months and tried again thinking they just needed to get into their groove. Same! All ice, no liquid, little flavor. I tried again this morning probably 6 months after my 2nd attempt and SAME. All ice and no flavor!! I know they would say if you don't like it you can ask them to remake it. But as a mom I'm trying to juggle my belongings and a child. I don't critique my drink until I'm in the car and driving away. Also, for a $6 drink they should know how to make, I feel I should be able to trust it's made right. Needless to say, 3 strikes and I will not be returning to this Starbucks again.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 16, 2018~I haven't had any problems with this location. They make my drink stronger than the one down the street. I just got one yesterday and it tasted watered down but this location tasted better. I like the employees and they work really fast. I had been when the drive thru was PACKED and went inside and got my order pretty quickly.They also have the canned refreshers- the other location down the street doesn't have them.Also it's still brand new and looks fancy, good location and cute outdoor seating :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Sep 24, 2017~Took a drink of my ice coffee and almost chocked to death. Not really, but it wasn't fun swallowing this.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Sep 17, 2017~Came here for the first time today, and went through the drive through. The wait was a little longer than the usual. When I got to the window I was handed my drinks and told to have a good day, and had to remind them about my food item. The service was good and my drink was perfect. Just make sure you don't drive off without everything you ordered while the iron the kinks out. This location did just open, and it looks like a nice location to sit inside and enjoy your drink or food inside.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 7, 2018~Ok. Here goes. I'm pretty fussy as my fellow Yelpers are aware and I have read the negatives posted here. Certainly, why would you spend extra $$$ to get bad anything. Right?However... I have to single out the most consistent, competent and ridiculously fabulous barista this side of a fashion runway....LONDON!!! Starbucks please take note here...seriously...this girl (London in case you missed it) is the epitome of great service with a smile. Starbucks should clone her as their corporate profits would exponentially skyrocket! Never an off encounter with her. We get her nearly every time at drive thru and not once have we had a less than perfect experience. She even asks in advance if our Maltese Turbo would like a pup cup. It's like reminiscing about how great service used to be. We have all had those dead eyed drones serve us with zombie like enthusiasm, but we go actually out of our way to visit this store. Today's grande Pink Drink was perfection. Thanks again for inspiring this review!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 21, 2018~Awesome customer service! Clean, quick and friendly! Thank you Starbucks  Would highly recommend stopping by ...... there are Starbucks everywhere, but the employees here are incredible
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Dec 17, 2019~I love this Starbucks! No matter how busy they are, they always manage to keep a smile on their face and keep that shit running! My drink's (almost) always made fast &amp; correctly. Also what happened to Ashley? She was my favorite barista! :(
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 29, 2018~Boy did I get a bad vente espresso frappe, tasted odd and had whip cream that I hadn't asked for.   A few sips and up it came, made a mess of my truck and the dress shirt I was wearing.I didn't go back but the Starbucks at Bell and 3rd St took care of me.  I won't be back at the Bell and Cave Creek store.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 8, 2018~I loved how friendly and fast the service was. I am really happy that they took the time to listen to my order and didn't feel any bit of rush even though they were slammed. This Starbucks store knows how to really operate !
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 19, 2019~Kariah was the sweet girl working the drive thru. Got my drink super fast and offered my dog a little cup with whip cream. Plus her makeup was on point. Would definitely go back and get pointers from her.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 9, 2019~The drive thru is always full and, can't simply can't break a $50 bill... all that wait for nothing. Should handle it better, I know they can change the 50 dollar bills. The worst place!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Oct 1, 2018~Not to busy on a Friday morning when I walked in.  Was able to get service right away.  Was able to get a Cold Foam Cascara Nitro.  Two other Starbucks I go to do not have the nitro machine so that was awesome.  It was delicious and beautiful to look at!  Only downside (minus one star) is that there are no comfortable seating options.  All hard wooden chairs.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Apr 4, 2019~The people are nice! They can't measure to save their life. They just always dump a ton of cream/milk into anything I order to the point I can't taste any coffee. Sometimes I have to have them remake my drink twice in one visit. This trip I mobile ordered it with light cream and they of course managed to dump the whole thing of cream in it.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jun 7, 2019~Really??Now you try to tell me i cant smoke in my car when i am getting coffee on the drive through?You guys are out of your minds and not you but there is no authority in this world that can tell me i can or cant smoke in my own vehicle,and if you don't like it tough beans,i am moving on to better coffee shops there is plenty around here,anyway who wants to pay an overpriced coffee and be told what to do in their own vehicle.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 8, 2018~I have come to this location many times before and my drinks have been ok. Today I ordered a hot soy latte in the drive-thru. It was half empty, full of foam, and the milk was wayyyyy hotter then normal. Seriously need to train the baristas better at this location--they have been drinkable before, but today's drink was awful.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 26, 2017~The worst Starbucks ive been to. Had to repeat our order several times and it was still wrong. When we were told the total, the amount was incorrect and we told them that the price did not sound right. They still R &amp; R card for that amount. Then voided it, then ran it again without telling us what the new amount was and what went wrong. Then she argued with us about why she ran the card without talking to us first. I am very disappointed in the service and we will not be returning. I recommend that you go to one of the many other Starbucks available.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 1, 2019~Bought a cheese danish with lots of black specks on it and wholes in the bread. No napkins
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 13, 2019~I've been coming to this Starbucks for over a year. Everyone is always very nice. Address me by name. Recognize my order when I go thru the drive thru. They also make my order before I'm at the register. Keep up the great customer service. I always like seeing those smiles. Always go out of my way to come to this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 20, 2019~This is the worst Starbucks I've been to they guy that was taking my order was giving me this look when I said what size drink I wanted and he rolled his eyes at me I was just trying to be nice and he was not having it i know maybe he had a bad day but that's no reason for him to make other people feel bad especially when he s working
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 6, 2018~This is my daily Starbucks as its very close to me. The staff is all very friendly and my drink and food are always correct. The drive thru is a busy one, but they keep it moving and always have a friendly barista at the window!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Apr 10, 2019~After reading the reviews on here, I was totally shocked. For one, anyone that says that someone else's job isn't that hard or that all they have to do is push a button is a total moron. Customer service has been proven to be one of the most difficult positions to hold especially in a busy fast-paced restaurant environment. As a former barista I can attest to the fact that one person's opinion of what heavy or light cream is, is totally different from another's. My experience has been that even though this store is often incredibly busy, the employees are always trying to serve you as quickly as possible and to use the measurements and recipes to create consistent beverages. When and if something is wrong or not what I was expecting they're always willing to remake it. I have seen many people treat the employees poorly over something as insignificant as a cup of coffee and yet still they respond politely and do their best to appease that person. I have found Cavecreek and Bell to be full of great employees who genuinely care about their customers and the connections that they create, and isn't that what it's all about?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 26, 2018~This is MY starbucks. I choose it over the others in the area (and there are many) due to the consistent good service. Not to say I've never had problems, but the employees are always quick to fix any I might have without hassle - very friendly and hardworking group. The place is always clean and orderly. Good place to study.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 17, 2018~I've been a Starbucks customer since the first store opened at the Pike Place Market in Seattle. I've been to many stores over the years and in four different states and this was the friendliest, nicest and most helpful store I've even been to. I was there on July 13, 2017, so whoever was working that morning, good job!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 16, 2017~Sunday evening I stopped at the fairly new location at Bell Rd and Cave Creek Rd. I had previously gone once before and had no problems. Sunday was different; besides having issues with my Starbucks gift card the drink was just awful!!!! When I asked how much was on the card they told me they were unable to say until I paid in cash. Which I did and they never came back to the window. If there was a problem with the gift card they should have been more helpful and at least returned it. There was not a line in drive through so there was no need to be rude. When I got home my grandson told me he would drink it as I did not want it, it was awful! He took two sips and agreed with me how nasty it was. Train your staff better, customers are not a joke as they help pay your salary. I would recommend some extra training for these two fellows. I am hesitant to even give one star.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 2, 2017~This Starbucks was a wonderful addition to our neighborhood! The staff is super friendly and efficient, Sam was so nice! The new Nitro Cold Brew on tap is awesome! Super smooth, rich, and gives you that kick start for the day. Richard was great, we will make this location our new home! Loving it!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 24, 2019~I have been to this Starbucks twice in the last week. The customer is paying for a product. The first time, I asked for my drink kids temp, not scalding; both times my drink was scalding when I touched the cup. After I left, I went back to the location, spoke with a Manager and said I was not happy paying $5 for a cup of scalding milk. His response was they are training people. I just came from there again, same thing happened, drink is scalding burned my tongue and it tastes like scalding hot milk with a lot of nutmeg. You really need to get your act together as customers are again paying for a product!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 4, 2017~Rebecca: I walked up to the counter at Star Bucks not knowing what to get for my sore throat. When Rebecca asked for my order, I started off by saying, I'm not sure because I have a sore throat. Before I could continue she said, I have the perfect thing for you. You introduced me to the peach tea concoction and I'm forever grateful. So soothing to my throat. Much obliged, Rebecca!Angel
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 17, 2017~Sandwiches are good and all yes its good. I have to drag this out because this app wont let me just say that its good. They want me to write a book
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 31, 2015~Brittany. Is a Starbucks. Worker she is very friendly and i.   Lovvvvvee her guest service
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 13, 2023~Worse Starbucks ever ordered a americano tasted like dirty dish water. Service was horrible person behind the counter made my order put in the pickup area did with other orders did not even bother to tell me it was there and was very rude
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Nov 16, 2023~Usually I have really good service when I come here. Today the workers seemed annoyed that I was interrupting their conversation with another co-worker. My bakery goods were not ready with my order. That was fine, but I didn't know the snowman cookie was in a basket. The guy was very dismissive about it. It was not busy at all. I left feeling like i was interrupting gossip time. Makes me wonder why I spend money on a overpriced drink so that I can be treated like a nuisance. My days going to Starbucks are numbered. Do customers even matter anymore?
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 15, 2023~took 30 minutes for a drink and a food item. then I'm told they just put it in the wrong spot and its been ready the whole time. poor crew and management would not go again.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 28, 2021~Just wow ! Julia took my order and wasn't friendly from the start. Right at the beginning when placing my order she made me feel uncomfortable, after taking the order she never asked for my name or if I needed my receipt, once my mother and I were waiting for our pink drinks , she got done and just threw our drinks to the side with out saying anything. Unfortunately my mother also noticed her attitude towards us. And yes I had to pretty much guess if that was our drinks , We never got a thank you or a word from her. So if you don't like to deal with customer service it would be great to change your job or just your attitude !
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Dec 28, 2021~This is by far the best Starbucks I've ever been to. The team always greets me with a smile! Julia tends to make my drinks most of the time, and she amazes me every time! No matter if I order something simple or complicated, she does her best! I would leave a 100 star rating if I could :) Thank you Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 24, 2019~I went in this location today. The cashier was not friendly. I was charged for a water which I've never been at any other Starbucks and shouldn't be with the price of their coffee's. When my order was finished and the barista was finished talking to another employee about Christmas plans, I asked for a straw for the iced coffee and she rudely tossed it to me, not saying a word. Rudest Starbucks I've ever been to. They should realize their are plenty of other coffee shops that welcome and appreciate customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~May 16, 2020~Awesome employees, always kind! :) They can be a bit busy at times but the order comes out fairly fast. Wish they didn't charge for water though, it's not expensive just an inconvenience.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Oct 28, 2024~I just went there right before they closed and the costumer service was great! I didn't know what drink I wanted and Anahi helped me decide! She made me as a customer feel cared for! Anahi is a great employee!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Nov 4, 2024~Holy cow this location has dramatically changed! They used to have an Northside and Eastside entrance, which is now only a Northside entrance. There is not longer a seating area inside, but there is outoutdoor seating. It seems like this is just a stop and go location. I had to go inside and order cause my app wasn't working and the drive thru line was going into traffic. I walk in and they asked if I was picking up, then they told me others were having app issues too. I placed an order with a batista for a carmel macchiato but I ended up with the apple macchiato... maybe applecrisp macchiato. Well it was, decent but not something I'll get again.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Nov 22, 2022~Nice location and it was surprisingly not busy. I order through my app for in store pick up. The parking lot is not the greatest, but they do have a drive thru!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Dec 31, 2023~Came here to study for a couple hours. Not too busy. Plenty of tables and outlets.Service was good, quick, consistent as expected for a Starbucks. Mocha frappe was great! They even asked if I want whip cream on top which sometimes they don't ask. That day I felt like it but sometimes I don't and it's kind of a Buzzkill.Good and chill atmosphere for studying. Though, not a lot of sunlight, and the tables are pretty cramped. If there are a lot of people there. Luckily, it was pretty empty the day I was there.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 22, 2023~Wonderful great service I received from this Starbucks. I simply stopped here for a souvenir and they had what I was looking for. The barista was extremely nice and provided great service. Inside, everything seem to be cleaned, stocked and organized. It definitely seem like a great Starbucks. Im a long term Starbucks member and definitely have high expectations when I visit.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jul 17, 2023~Great drinks.  Super fast.  Great online app for preorders.  Alway fresh and clean.  Drive thru is always fast and courteous
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Aug 22, 2023~If you have never tried cold pressed juice, I would suggest buying the Evolution brand that they sell at Starbucks. Admittedly, it's more expensive than buying these drinks on Amazon. I used my gift card to buy a bacon gouda sandwich, two Evo juices, and a vente matcha frapp. Unfortunately, this location does not carry the watermelon Evo juice. They got my order wrong so I had to wait extra for them to re-do my order. The whole order cost $21.50. The food was of average quality.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Apr 15, 2023~Food:Drinks are incredible the team has like a 95% accuracy rate if you add any modifications. They're also one of tastier locations. They have a varying selection of their food products so sometimes a regular favourite may be out of stock for a while. Merchandise: Very limited. They may have the seasonal cups but I rarely see them in store here. They're relatively busy so maybe they run out quickly which is understandable. Ambiance: I've never had a negative experience with any of the baristas. From seeing other interactions they all seem to be very pleasant. Whether drive up or sit down they are very attentive and caring. Unfortunately, if you do choose to sit down to sip, they don't have the cleanest cafe. At any given point their floors are not swept. And there are little flies everywhere.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Dec 11, 2021~Just an average Starbucks experience as far as I can tell...although I'm not sure all Starbucks have coconut milk, which I appreciated here. I was staying with a friend and went over in the morning to get a latte.The following day it was a little earlier and was too crazy crowded to stay, but I don't think that's unusual.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Aug 8, 2023~Great service.. costumer service was great. Thank you for my delicious ice coffee...........
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Nov 21, 2023~Awesome place to meet someone!!! Great coffee and a little expensive but worth it ! Love this place
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 14, 2021~Nasty everytime I go here I want a refund.The best thing you can get is steamed milk and that probably won't be foamed right.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Oct 15, 2019~Star for very friendly cashier/barista.  Star for amazing coffee and snack, as always.But, man-oh-man, no more stars for a miserable drive-through experience!  I get that they're making lattés and such, but it took nearly a half hour to get my order, from the time I started in the line to the time I pulled away.  I'd guess no more than 10 cars total, but everyone drives trucks there, so probably closer to 7.My impression is not based purely on just this one location either.  I've spent plenty of minutes at plenty of Starbucks in my brief time on this planet earth.  Even if I have the cars or exact time in seconds wrong, believe me, this was a much longer wait than usual.Still, the staff were friendly enough, despite the frustrations they likely had to face all afternoon.  The drink and nosh were fine.  Nothing out of sorts there.  Maybe things are faster inside, but I didn't have the chance to find out.  If I'm ever back out there again, though, I might have to give it a go.  If for no other reason than comparison.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Mar 9, 2021~This morning there was a barista gal outside and drive through taking orders which made it fairly quicker during rush hour. Decided to get out and sit for a while. They're pretty good at noticing when homeless people are lurking about begging. It's a beautiful sunny Tuesday and I got plenty of vitamin D sitting outside and a slight sunburn. Good thing I have a cool Grande soy chai latté.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 20, 2021~Titled Waited too Long for Too LittleDROVE IN TODAYWAITED 17 Minutes To get to window pay and come home to have my wife yell me we got charged for a Venti and she got a Grande in the Venti cup.As. Regular Starbucks Customer if not daily this IS NOT acceptable. $6.00 for the largest Hot Coffee they sell to be cheated. The curly hair soft voiced boy at the window better be careful.  Do this to a Karen Or Chad and Starbucks Co. May need Legal onsite.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Nov 21, 2022~While I don't have a good experience here with most of the baristas, Riley is always chatting and trying to build a decent customer connection. Almost always working the POS system and and ensuring customers orders are correct. Riley is a rockstar and absolutely needs to be recognized for it. Thanks Riley!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jun 21, 2019~Dirty bathroom. Disgusting and overflowing trash bins! This place was not even busy and couldn't keep it neat and today.I will not return to this location, especially not to use the filthy toilets.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Oct 22, 2022~Was in the drive through line for 45min. At least 8 cars ahead of me and was late to work. Come on Starbucks. Do better.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Apr 26, 2022~Buyer Beware!!! (Hidden Fees!) Before heading back to Las Vegas we stopped at this Starbucks. This was my wife experience I watched the whole thing.  We came we were greeted happily and friendly. My wife had asked to unlock the bathroom. The 2 women behind the counter chatting up totally ignored my wife. My wife asked again `"Can you open the restroom door please?`" Same Starbucks worker looking annoyed and pointed at the blonde hair lady with glasses said I'm Coming!!! I'm coming..(she look annoyed) (after wife comes out the bathroom)Time to order our Starbucks drinks then head out . The dark hair Starbucks girl takes our order I got pink drink (which includes strawberries inclusions)and my wife got the strawberry refresher (which includes strawberry inclusions). The dark hair Starbucks lady said we don't have strawberry add on  for your drinks (Free) but we can add Dragon Fruit. We say yes to add it . We pay &amp; wait 5-10 mins . Upon grabbing our Drinks we notice no dragon fruit in our drinks and that we had been charged for the added Dragon Fruit inclusions $0.80 cents each drink .Dark hair lady said `"sorry no more dragon fruit`"My wife says `"we'll can you refund it please I mean why pay for something your not going to even have`"...dark hair Starbucks says,`"we don't charge for inclusion in the drink.`" Me: `"But you did.Then told her again we did get charged for it(shows receipt)...`"Do you want a refund then? `" Dark hair Starbucks said looking annoyed. The dark hair girl tells boss what happened and the supervisor says `"Why would I refund something that should be free.`" (I know right!)  She looks at dark hair girl then me&amp; my wife . My wife shows her the receipt and then the supervisor says sarcastically,`"o looks like you did get charge for the dragon fruit. &amp; we never charge for add ons `" moral of the story Check your receipt or you get charged extra things you didn't want to get charged for....
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Oct 20, 2022~If you want friendly service, look no further. Jeserae is the best and greats you with a smile. I usually frequent this spot on weekday mornings and never had any problems . Keep up the great work.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 17, 2021~If I could give it no stars I would. This is the worst Starbucks in all of America and that says a lot. Took them five minutes of me standing at the front to take my order. Then a cool 25 minutes later they gave me my two drinks and cake pops. Just wow it was super impressive. I mean I've never seen anything like it. Stay away from here. Gas station coffee is much better.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 23, 2022~Christina girl at the window &amp; taking orders is really rude &amp; needs to be trained better. She has no manners. We told her iced coffee at the drive thru &amp; gave us hot coffee &amp; told her at the window we asked iced &amp; gave us a really bad attitude.. happened Sep 23rd 10:55am
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Jan 26, 2022~Problems all the time, 2 times I've went here for a chai tea latte. Both times tasted terrible. Had to go to another Starbucks to have them remake it.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 26, 2019~Really disappointed!! I came in at 4pm. It is now 4:41 pm and still waiting for my drinks. One of the managers had to go around and ask us what we ordered. Very disappointed. People that were after us are still getting their drinks before us. I understand if it's busy, but in this case i feel like I've been forgotten about! Definitely will not return to this Starbucks again. Have not even been apologized or even accommodated for the wait. Still waiting.... Update: got our drinks about 4:48... and they messed up on one of my drinks,  wasn't even going to wait any longer. Really disappointed! And to top off look at what I was given, all 3 of my drinks were really sloppy and dripping from the sides, as if they were in a hurry and didn't care.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Nov 22, 2019~Loved the eggnog latte and their house coffee .it was a delight being here .They have so many options both hot and cold brews .you can smell the coffee beans when you enter the store and it makes all that difference :-) welcoming smell aroma of coffeee is so awesome !!Will be back for some more coffeee
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Jan 7, 2020~Really wish they'd take of the bees outside. I've been coming here on and off from my moms since I was 17. Now 27 (about 10 years) and they have wait time down these days and a somewhat good consistency throughout serving the drinks but, it's been 3 times now on my way to work that I've gone to work and had had bees fly into my car I had to shoo one out and literally roll my window up for a minute at the window to not have it in my carLady who served me who says `"cheers`" to everyone gives some mad attitude sometimes too Please don't be rude when I'm paying $6+ for a cup of coffee 3 times a week (usually)I worked in a resort in CO during the winter as a barista as my first job so I know how irritating it CAN be, be your attitude is not necessary Especially when I can afford syrups and build my own bar for $30 or less instead of spending 50+ a month :) Thanks so much
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~May 20, 2018~It pains me to give this location 2 stars. For about a year now I have been frequenting this location four or five times a week in the morning before work. Dylan usually makes my order and knows me by name. The last couple of times he hasn't been there and a 30 something Sour looking woman has been making my beverage and it's been wrong both times. I always mobile order so I know by the label if the mistake is mine or theirs . First time, pineapple black tea lemonade, sweetened. Get to the truck...unsweetened. Ok, I don't need the sugar so I shrug it off. Today, I order a trenta iced caramel coffee with 2%. Pretty simple, pretty straight forward. She puts my coffee up and it doesn't have the milk, black coffee. I show her the label and she says, with attitude, `" my bad`"! Instead of making my drink over she proceeds to dump part of my coffee out and add about 2 tablespoons of milk, puts it back in the mobile order tray and walks away.Starbucks survives on people like me, people that spend at least $5 a day, sometimes twice a day. Not sure if I can frequent this business anymore. The coffee really isn't that good some days it's actually quite bitter and old tasting.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Sep 16, 2017~Only been here a few times, but definitely not my favorite Starbucks. I only come here if I'm in the area.Overall this spot is pretty good. My only real complaint is the people that work here. They aren't very friendly and SUPER slow! I don't know what makes them so slow to get orders out as there are always a lot of people behind the counter. Don't expect the workers to smile or say hi neither. I've never had any problems with them making my drinks correctly, but they constantly mess up on my babe's drinks. How hard is it to make an iced coffee?? I normally go inside as the drive-thru is always so busy! Not the cleanest place! Tables are always dirty and floors need sweeping. Trash is always full to the top and milk is always out, at least when I am there. And bathrooms need checking up on regularly as they need cleaning often. Will probably be back as I need my caffeine, but this location really does need to step up it's game.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jul 2, 2019~My first time here for a `"short`" meeting that expanded to 3 hours. What!  I like people watching stand my companion was great so no big deal. Bathroom was neat and clean, staff was friendly and service was quick. A couple of things:A couple of folks who looked to be transients came in and actually took short naps. Never ordered anything and didn't bother anyone. Phoenix is so hot in the Summer and temps that day were expected to be as high as 112f. I'm glad the employees didn't force the group back into the heat. The other thing is tables and counters were not wiped down when we arrived. I did clean the table myself.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Apr 9, 2022~Please just park and go inside. The drive thru is in the WORST spot imaginable and I was nearly hit because there's too many cars blocking the entrance from the main road. And I was in the parking lot! The city needs to close that entrance off, or the store needs to close and redesign the drive thru so it's safer. This location is not worth going to. Too dangerous
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Dec 28, 2021~This morning Jeserae greeted me with such fun energy even though it was 5:30am. She was so nice and made it seem like she was having a blast! I love coming to this starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jul 6, 2019~Stopped in for a cold drink while waiting for car to be ready at nearby tire company. Not a big store with not too many tables and all were full. We sat at the bar. Drinks came out fast and were delicious as always. We both tried their new cloud macchiato drinks. I got caramel and hubby got cocoa. All workers were polite and friendly and working hard to get orders out. There a wreck 2 groups of homeless people sitting at the 4 seat tables with a couple of shopping carts of their possessions outside. They didn't bother any customers inside and kept to themselves.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~May 27, 2021~Today was difficult,  walked in to only be greeted by this very unhappy girl at the bar, who very sadly said I'll be right with you.  I got a very excited loud `"welcome in`" from the other side of the room though!  The very sad girl finally asked me what my name was for my mobile order, she handed me the order I left.  I realized that my drink was wrong (Which baffles me because it is a Venti iced breve latte how hard is that to make three shots of espresso and half-and-half/breve). So I walk back in and the whole store just seemed like they have horrible management.  The whole store (With the exception of that one person who greeted me with passion) was down and sad and depressed almost!   Not the way anyone should feel when walking into a Starbucks of all places.  I didn't even complain and walked out.  This drink is so easy to make and it's always wrong.  I feel like the baristas have so much going on they can't concentrate on what's going on.  They are rushed and made to be robotic like!  It's sad.  I see it at this Starbucks more then most.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jun 19, 2021~Apparently they don't close at 10:00pm. I pulled into the drive thru behind another vehicle that ordered and when I went to place mine they said I'm sorry but the car in front of you is our last order. Ummm. It's not even 10pm and no one behind me. I came there to get a couple drinks for some people working late in the area that wanted coffee and a smoothie.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jan 20, 2018~This may have been my Worst Starbucks experience. Ordered a Venti coffee and talked with my partner inside of the store for a while then went up to get a refill and that is went my experience went sour. I am a gold member and get free refills and when I went to scan my card I was charged the full price. No big deal, honestly just went back to let her know so I could get my money back. Ann proceeded to argue with me about how I wasn't charged. Though when we looked at my history of payments it showed I was. She acknowledged the payment in my history and said that is how it shows up. No. Never has that ever happened in my history of refills. She wouldn't back down or be reasoned with. I have less money on my card it's obvious I was charged. I'm not one for confrontation so I stopped trying. Thankfully my boyfriend went up to talk to them again because i was too upset. He talked to a different barista who questioned if we were always there in the store at which point he showed them the time of the original purchase and eventually was refunded the money.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 20, 2019~Here's my small of cup of tea  `~ So I went to buy a Grande pink drink, left to Discount Tire and dropped it. I went back to Starbucks, of course not minding to buy another one, they hooked ya girl up with a free Venti Pink drink. I can definitely say this place is a go to place, they're really sweet and very generous. Thank you guys so much, you made my day
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~May 11, 2022~Worst Starbucks!! The drive thru needs to be closed or moved. I drive by here all the time in the morning and literally cars will be lined up on the street just to get into the driveway. And apparently because the sidewalk is city property, they cannot have employees on the sidewalk directing traffic. Well maybe you should have signage or a better system to control the traffic. And if you call to complain, they don't care. And if you get accosted by a crazy person in front of you because you lightly tapped on your horn for the car in front of them to move because cars were backing up into the parking lot, again they don't give a crap. They are lucky I didn't call the police because of the crazy lady who accosted me. Worst Starbucks. And dangerous too.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~May 23, 2020~I have been coming here for 4 years and the personnel here has always treated me great.  If something was wrong they made it right, no questions asked.  They took care of us during COVID and went out of their way to make our day much brighter!! Love the store and its personnel!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Oct 7, 2021~So I usually go through their drive thru every morning before work, and the drink quality is good aside from the mess that is their drive thru. But they handle it well and push out drinks quick. Today I was in a hurry so I went inside and ordered a London fog tea latte. After waiting for ten minutes they handed me an iced tea. No milk. So I asked them to remake it. So the lady threw in some milk and gave it back. So I took a sip and it was super nasty so I asked them to remake it again. So they did. And after five more minutes of waiting they gave me the same a$$ shiet. Bruh how hard is it to steep some tea it was so gross i tossed it in a dumpster as soon as I found one. Went to Starbucks on 43rd and thunderbird and they hooked it upppp
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Feb 5, 2022~Horrible experience. I mobile order at every store so it's easier for me and the baristas. Me and my other waited for 5 minutes after our drinks were supposed to be ready which was okay at first but then they only gave me one drink which I ordered 2, and it didn't have cold foam on it which is more than a dollar extra so I asked for her to put cold foam on it and she dumped the whole thing and restarted it. Fine but she could have just put cold foam on top.. then I asked about my second drink and they didn't even have the sticker. So I showed her my phone and told her directly they weren't the same drinks. She looks and tells me she'll get it going. It takes 10 more minutes for them to remake my two drinks and she ends up making my second one the same exact thing as my first one just a venti, which was completely wrong. I told her it was supposed to be made with mocha and cinnamon dolce syrup and I can tell by looking at it that it was made with white mocha, but she kept insisting it wasn't until finally deciding to listen to me but by that time we had already been waiting in the lobby 25 minutes and I was over it so we ended up just taking and paying for a completely wrong drink because we didn't want to wait another 10 minutes. Extremely disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Aug 18, 2018~What can I say about Starbucks, other than the fact that it's in Phx and hot as hell here!! But went with the new iced coconut coffee latte, so good, wish there was more coconut flavoring to enjoy!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jan 16, 2022~my ham and swiss was frozen inside lol after waiting 30 mins in drive thru lol i was pissed AF like how?
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~May 19, 2016~New location situated a little more west on Peoria.Drive thru never fails to have a line, so keep that in mind if you're planning on not making a pit stop. However, the service and quality of my drink was great. Ordered an iced vanilla latte prior to heading off for 8 A.M. class and expected overly acidic/tangy coffee that Starbucks can sometimes have but found my drink pleasant and not overly sweet with Vanilla syrup. The worker helping me was so friendly and nice! He complimented my car, which never fails to be a conversation starter. She's a MINI, tiny ... but mighty- I always say!Pretty popular location, but staff/service here is great!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jul 9, 2015~New location! I personally enjoy this one a lot more due to it not being wedged between other establishments, unlike the previous location down the street.Went in for an iced latte and a bagel during break and was served quickly. Dropped a star because my drink was a bit on the acidic side and my bagel was kind of tough to chew, despite being warmed up. The location is organized, fast-paced, had everything stocked (food, drinks, napkins, straws) and was so clean. The interior is spaces with bar stools, tables to an open patio.Also for those looking for a quick Starbucks run, they do have a drive-thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 26, 2019~By far the worst Carmel Macciatto we have ever had. As a regular to the 43rd Ave and Dunlap that we couldn't get ti drive through we decided to hit this one.We knew we were on trouble when:1.  the Afro Jock working the mic and the window took 3 tries to confirm our order.2. When he quickly scanned my phone not asking if I wanted to to redeem my free coffees. 3. Then he quickly attempts to hand me our drinks without whip cream and barely had Carmel at all.4. We decided to drive away and sip something the kin of hor Chocolate and Milk. We have be avid Starbucks patrons for too many years for this blatant lack of communication and commitment. And we wonder why there are lawsuits. This young man should walked down the street with a Bell Ringer...For SHAME....SHAMESHAMESHAME
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 26, 2021~I've been here a few times, and typically the food and drinks are really delicious. This time was a little different, it was my fault. I driven through drive-through and realized at the window that we have forgotten our debit card, at the very least, miss placed it. So inconveniently, we had to park our car and looked for the card. while we were looking,a Very nice woman named Tenisse came out and greeted us and still gave us the drinks. I was blown away. Such an awesome and generous thing to do! I definitely recommend this place. As mentioned, I've been here several times before.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 8, 2019~This is a nice place to enjoy a yummy drink while  meeting with people, surfing the net or grabbing something to go. They always get my drinks right and are friendly and professional. We love the drive thru and the restroom is clean.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Aug 27, 2021~This store receives a zero stars. Typically there's 10 people working at this Starbucks location.  No one greets you. When I step up to pick up my mobile order that I put in at least 15 mins prior to my arrival there's an additional wait of 10 mins or more. Not a single acknowledgment from anyone unless prompted. Stores dirty. 10 people making money doing as little as possible. Yet that seems to be the theme these days..
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Feb 26, 2021~Asked for Light Ice and you get a cup of ice. The girl working the counter was not at the counter to begin with and then must have not been paying attention. This one star is for her service. I will not be back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Jun 15, 2018~Was disappointed. It took awhile for our drinks ( was not really busy at all)  and they gave me a blueberry muffin opposed to the scone I ordered. They switched them but it still was not a great experience, and the barista was not in the best of customer service after that.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 22, 2021~I have been to this location numerous times but the past 3 times I've been there, I went inside because the line was really long. Each time I ordered a different latte and every time it was amazing. I noticed it was same the girl who made it the last two times. I can't remember her name but it starts with a `"S`" and she has really long hair. I will make sure to request her to make it again next time I see her there. You should request her to make yours too because they are perfection!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Aug 10, 2019~Dirtiest Starbucks I've ever been in. I mean if I have to wipe tons of crumbs off the table just to make room for my laptop I'm not gonna be very happy here. Even the floor was super dirty with crumbs everywhere. I wasn't happy about using the socket on the floor to plug my laptop I'm. It wasn't clean at all. I get that they're busy but this wasn't a case of a few dirty tables. All the tables were dirty and it was bad... They don't even have to comfy chairs here
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Feb 7, 2016~Always quick when I go thru this drive thru. I saw a lot of reviews saying they were slow, but it's never happened to me, thankfully:)Drinks are always good and they always give my dog a cup of whip:)Love that there is a drive thru now in this area, although this particular drive thru isn't ideally set up for lots of traffic, but again, I've never been here when it was crazy busy so it hasn't really affected me. Overall a great Starbucks:)
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~May 25, 2019~Great customer service here!!! I accidentally spilled my drink and the Manager, Ann replaced it!  All the workers  at this store were friendly!  Most  importantly though they looked happy to be there ! A great testimony to the manager, Ann! Keep inspiring your crew Ann!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~May 4, 2017~This location is notorious for getting my order wrong. I usually let it slide. Today I asked for light ice and the cup was literally full of ice. I will not be returning to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 12, 2020~Not very friendly, not very organized and the hot chocolate was more like chocolate flavored water. My friend had a hazelnut cappuccino with caramel and tossed most of it. Very disappointed
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Feb 20, 2019~When into Starbucks right after an off-duty employee went in with her baby. I waited five minutes as she was engaging in a conversation with a worker at the register. Mind you I'm waiting to order and she had already taken her tea order. The off-duty employee hands her baby over to the employee at the register as I'm waiting another employee had looked at me and nothing. Ended up just walking out. Where's the customer service?
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 10, 2020~I have been going to this location for about 3 years. The staff truly carries out Starbucks Mantra on customer service and quality product. Anne and her team are professional and handle the rush of customers at this high volumn store both inside and the always busy drive-through. You always get a smile and a hello.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 13, 2021~They never have strawberry's just like McDonald's never has ice cream. Please add more to the weekly delivery.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jan 30, 2009~My gawd, have I been so blind?! Every morning I have a shot of espresso at home from my Miele (CVA 4070  Coffee System) with beans from Cafe Cortez. Each shot is velvety smooth with hints of smokiness and chocolate. This is probably one of finest shots of espresso just for me, every morning, except for... Friday.I stay out at my bffs house way out in Surprise once a week to visit her and her bf.  So on my way in to work I sometimes stop by Starbucks for a Friday morning booster. So this morning I ordered a single shot of espresso and nearly choked. Simply horrible, its like a scorched burnt coffee taste that's so bitter while maintaining a weird sourness. My gawd this stuff is pure shit. I cant believe it, after all these years I finally see the light. Starbucks coffee for me is utter crap. I pitched it in the garbage and have sworn off Starbucks. The single star is for the wonderfully cute and perky `"barista`"
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 19, 2020~I went there the other day, and it was not my run in with very hurtful customer service and rude remarks and looks made through the drive threw. Hurts to say this is not the Starbucks you should be going too if you want a welcoming place to come into, nothing but rude things were said to me, and was talked down to while ordering. :( sad.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Mar 2, 2013~Definitely one of the better Starbucks in the area that I have been to.  I enjoy coming to this location a little bit more then the others for a variety of reasons. For starters, plenty of tables! I've been able to find a seat here every single time I've come over the last few weeks and this makes me very happy.  Also, for the most part, it's really clean.  The one time I needed a table wiped down (it was busy and the customer was walking out as I was walking in) it was done quickly by the barista.Staff here is friendly and outgoing, and seem to do a good job of keeping it that way.  Place is well stocked, bathrooms are clean enough, and overall, I really enjoy coming here.  Even though it gets busy at times, its a far better experience then I've had at other Starbucks close to me.Parking's a little tight, so be careful getting in and out, and it's in a strip mall, so there's lots of cars coming in and out.  Even though its an extra mile from my house, its worth coming here.  Free wifi as with all the other starbucks, and they have great hours too!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 5, 2018~Hanna is terrific, while there are a few people who are great there, nice, outgoing and full of smiles.  Hanna always makes my drinks the best.I never knew that restretto even existed until Hanna went out of her way to tell me about it one evening.  I say she went out of her way be a use she was just going out of the door when I arrived and I told her that I was sad that she was leaving because she always makes my coffees the best.  She was touched and said it was her pleasure to make my experience a very good experience.  She never hurried me she told me how to order my drink because I always forget how to order it.  She took her time helping me while she was off duty.  I appreciate her help &amp; genuine smiles.Please reward her for her great customer service.  She really deserves it very much.  Thank you again Hanna.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jun 23, 2015~Love this location! They always are quick in their drive they and my drink is always correct. The entire staff are incredibly friendly, as always!I've been coming here since they moved to this new location and it's so nice. Jazzy-Boo, the barista is my favorite! She is always so bubbly and fun. Great way to cheer up my mornings on my way to work!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 6, 2015~I love this place and the drive-through is especially convenient on my way to work every morning. They have a video order window and are only one of four in the nation!!! So super cool and I took a picture. The staff is incredibly friendly and always so nice I highly recommend the ice coffee as well as the cake pops and vanilla scones. Yummy!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Dec 7, 2018~I went here the other night specifically to get their caramel salted mocha creme frappachino. Once I ordered this item, they told me they had no salt. Why is it still being offered then? That's the whole point of the drink! I ordered the drink anyways, and asked for extra extra caramel. I even asked him to put the caramel around the cup before they put the drink in, and the only extra caramel that I got, was maybe two extra lines on top of my whip cream. None in the cup whatsoever. And then.... we tried to order some of their breakfast sandwiches. And literally every single one that I tried to order, they did not have available. I do not suggest you go to this Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 5, 2019~Every time I go to a Starbucks and request a decaf coffee brewed staff gives me a hard time only pour overs this store finally brewed stated would be 8 minutes I don't mind but it took over 12 minutes.  Attitude at this Starbucks if staff and manger just don't care what happened to Starbucks happy go lucky staff they are GONEI have a caffeine allergy that's why I need Brewed decaf the pour overs SUCK basically water coffee.  Starbucks should do a taste test to see what customers prefer pour over or brewed decaf I will keep giving reviews on this store see if anything changes Highly doubt but we will see
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Dec 27, 2016~The manager made my drink today.  With curdled whole milk.  Said she been using it all morning.   I poured out the sour coffee at work and this is the `"milk`" see pic. They did correct the order, I made sure not to ask for the whole milk again.  but I had to leave work to get it. They should throw out bad milk.  It was chunky.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jan 7, 2020~Went here today at 3:30 pm, the drive thru person was rude and did not listen at all to what we ordered. I told her I was using my stars to get one of the drinks for free but she ended up charging us for both the drinks. She gave me one straw at first but asked if she gave me one or two, I responded with one but she was not listening, before driving off I asked for another straw and she rudely replied, `"that's what I asked you at the beginning`". I have never experienced this at this location until today.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Sep 25, 2016~Nor sure what has happened to this location, but lately it's an absolute mess. Service is slow, but the staff is friendly. This location is not indicative of the cleanliness of Starbucks in general.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Aug 21, 2018~Have had nothing but great drinks from this location. Hot or cold, they make it quick and consistent. I know I'm going to get a great drink. The staff here are very kind and always seem to be smiling (even at 4:30 am).
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 6, 2018~Bad experience both times. Went through the drive thru ordered a Strawberry Açaí blended. They told me they were unable to blend it because `"that's not how the drink comes`". I told her, I get it like this all the time I've never had a problem. She said she would ask her shift supervisor. Then she comes back to the intercom and said we can blend it but we're not allow to put in the strawberry inclusions in the blender. I said `"ok!`" And pulled up to the window. This never happens, what is going on?!It was a free one so I didn't really care anymore.Second time I go in the actual store. I mobile ordered online and they made my ice coffee wrong. They didn't put cream or my extra caramel drizzle in. I go to the register and let the girl know that problem. She didn't say anything. She also didn't remake it either she just put some cream and Caramel on top and called it a day. I was in a rush so took it. Needless to say, that's the last time you'll see me here.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 20, 2019~Starbucks usually has great customer service but not this one. One of the drinks were made wrong and the girl at the window basically told me was wrong. And wanted me to explain in detail what was wrong with the  coffee.  I will definitely go to a different Starbucks even though this one is closest to me.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jun 22, 2018~Broke down on I17 and just made it to mechanic just off interstate...gonna be a big bill and the mechanic drove me to this Starbucks. Accidentally spewed my bad day to the barista and she insisted my coffee was on her today. Who does this anymore? Thank you so much Christina!!! You made my horrible day way better!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jul 21, 2019~After a very long wait at the dive thru,  Starbucks made it right. Thank you Starbucks for my chia tea latte.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 7, 2021~IF YOU WANT TO GET IN A CAR WRECK COME HERE! Honestly whoever was working outside and taking orders Must've had 2 brain cells left, I guess they hire anyone, the traffic is literally out the street, and skipped our order when pulled up further to help the cars behind us. Ridiculous honestly. Do not come here unless you need a new car.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jul 27, 2016~Always super friendly Baristas, the drinks are always as I order.   Always a line on drive thru, dont get in line if in rush, typically faster inside.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Jan 4, 2016~You'd think that when an old, strip mall version of Starbucks moves into its own stand alone building with a drive-thru, everything would be 10 times better.  Unfortunately, this location is the exception to the rule.Slow service - both inside and out. Lackluster 'partners' with personalities to match...this store took a nosedive after moving and apparently left any sort of character and charisma it did have, back in it's dark, empty, Starbucks shell.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Nov 14, 2015~Extremely slow service, crowded spot!  Parking:  Easy, plenty of spots. Service:  Apathetic and uncaring.  The barista / cashier barely spoke above a whisper and when I asked how he was, he stated, `"crap.`" I couldn't hear him anyway but then he expanded to tell me how awful he was today.   The guy was so quiet, I had to keep asking what he said.  Wait time: Forever and ever amen.  My iced coffee seriously took over 25 minutes - wow!  Tons of folks were waiting for their coffees. Food/drinks: Same ole - it's Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Oct 27, 2020~I was charged for pumpkin cream cold foam on top of my iced chai tea latte, but didn't get any cold foam what so ever. Not to mention I received the worst cinnamon dolce latte I've ever had in my life. Starbucks isn't good in general, but it's best avoid this location completely. I can typically choke down a bad coffee that I spent my money on but today ended up pouring my drink down the drain. Disappointing.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 31, 2020~I hate to leave this bad review but this is the second time that I have gone to this Starbucks and they have messed up on my drinks, they all had a odd taste, a little bitter.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 29, 2018~We went through the drive thru and it was organized,  quick and we even went during a special 1/2 off grande specialty drinks!! Our barista was pleasant and everything went with out a hitch! We will be using this drive thru in the future since it is so convenient.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Jun 24, 2018~This location is extremely hit or miss. I come here 2-4 times a week on my way to work and it's not always a pleasant experience. Half of the time I get super rude girls taking my order who have very poor attitudes &amp; interrupt you before you finish telling them your order. The other half of the time I get a really nice guy or older lady who takes my order &amp; tells me to drive safe. I love them! And although most of the staff acts like they hate their job, my drink is 9/10 perfect!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Apr 3, 2015~This Starbucks has really bad ratings for what appears to be a newly opened, or newly remodeled Starbucks with a nice ambiance. Perhaps there were growing pains.I had a non-fat vente Ice Latte and a split a cookie. We were happy with the speed and the new design of this Starbucks. Getting in and out was no issue and the whole process probably took 5-6 minutes. Perhaps Spring Training was a rough time for this Starbucks, but it's definitely a nice looking store with great service.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Oct 24, 2020~I mean it was ok, i ordered a Mango Dragon Fruit Lemonade and they added the smallest amount of it, i can't say they were busy because the line was completely empty. i won't be going here again.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Feb 19, 2018~This location is so close to my house, I love it it's always very quick the barista's are so nice! I enjoy the early morning hours that they're open
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Jul 25, 2019~Every time I've been here, they close earlier than their posted hours on the corporate website. I have a feeling they aren't supposed to, but I'm guessing they rush customers out so they can end their shift sooner.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 24, 2015~Since the Starbucks is moved to the drive thru I don't think any of the same people and it is literally slow as close as I've been in line for a half an hour this middle of the afternoon
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Sep 11, 2020~I go to this location practically every morning. The girl who used to work the drive threw at this time was always amazing. So nice and friendly and easy to talk to at 4am. There is another girl working the drive thru who is rude and moody. If you aren't a morning person, don't work the morning shift because not only do we set the tone for your day, but you set it for ours. (For the record I was very friendly and even tried to have a conversation and got NO response from her except a `"thanks have a good day`". Might have to find a different location to go to so I can start my morning the right way.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~May 17, 2018~The store at 8:54am said they cannot sell me  to macadamia nut cookies because they sold slot this morning. But they refused to state that they were sold out. She just said she can't do that. Being as this is the only 'vegan' friendly item you offer it was mice while it lasted I guess.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 24, 2018~Best location on their side of town. It's always busy but the staff always moves the line quick and they're all always very cheerful and happy to accommodate you. AND this one never runs out of apple juice to substitute in drinks. WiFi always runs good, really nice atmosphere. Whoever's managing this place deserves a gold medal, it's dramatically different than it used to be.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Dec 6, 2015~Giving this location a second chance....writing review as I wait...so still alot of the same slow but they are trying...this time both registers open a plus ...I was here yesterday my drink was wrong, however barista remade with a smile. ..today same barista that remade drink was at register and she remembered me so that's a plus. ...Meg (she had her name tag on) made the drink I ordered Iced Cestnut Praline no whip Extra Topping...and she knows what extra topping is !!!! ;) I'll be back it's closest location
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 30, 2018~Fine, we'll go elsewhere. On 9-29-18 around 8pm, me and several of my friends walked-in to enjoy some drinks and visit. But there was not a free table for all of us to sit together. So I asked the lady outside that was locking up the patio chairs if she would unlock some chairs for us to sit at and was told, `"NOPE.`" So we ended up leaving. I guess the night manager took the night off
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Dec 31, 2019~I always come here but this time was special because there were giving out free drinks from 1-2 and let me say this not matter if the drinks were free the personal there was very nice. They actually enjoyed doing this for us the customers today. Love it thank u Starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Nov 7, 2015~I feel awful giving this location such a low rating, as I've been coming to the old location for years and know most of the old guard by name, but the service has really gone downhill since the move to the drive-thru location. On almost every single visit that falls on a weekday, I wait almost 15 minutes to get to the window, and my drinks still aren't ready. It's even bad on the weekend. Today, there were only three cars in front of me. By the time I got to the window, only one of my drinks was ready. I thought the entire point of the drive-thru system was that the time between ordering and arriving at the window gave the baristas time to make the drinks. The last straw was when my wife and I opened our sandwiches and saw the eggs and sausages practically falling out the bread. Just sloppy all around.I think this has more to do with all the new staff they had to hire because of the addition of the drive thru. I never have issues when the veterans are working.But really, the impetus for the low rating really came when I visited the new location at 52nd St. and Broadway. I was waiting in line less than five minutes, and the barista at the window informed me that my drink was free because I waited too long. Seriously? If the Peoria location had to give out free drinks to every customer who waited more than five minutes on a weekday, they would have to close down.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Aug 24, 2010~Two stars only because the ladies working were fabulous although the one chalked my chai full of ice..... Ummmm easy ice was stated in my order for a reason because I want alot of damn milk!!! The floor was dirty and there were no clean tables.... Maybe the worker bees shouldn't focus on the fashionable friendly faggot(me) because honey.... You ain't gettin none of this!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Oct 20, 2017~1 Star: The price of course was reasonable for the Frappuccino I had ordered.2 Star: Being that I had gone through the drive-thru, I am unable to comment on the appearance of the inside. The landscape was very well kept if anything.-1 Star: The place was is in a rather tight spot across a plaza where there is traffic. I suggest avoiding this location if your in a rush.-1 Star: As for the customer service can be simply be improved by not having an attitude towards customers who need a bit more time to make a selection. The gal who took my order through the drive thru on Oct 16 sounded impatient when I asked for another moment.-1 Star: My overall experience with this location was not at all as I expected. I understand that customers want fast and accurate service but that is no reason for an associate to `"rush`" a paying customer. I will definitely NOT be back to this location in the future.(Thank you for reading this review - I am writing reviews of everywhere I eat when I dine out, places I shop, movies I watch and much more. Stay posted with #ReviewByMariaMescal)
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Apr 15, 2011~Two stars because there isnt a drive thru.. and Im a lazy American who forgot that when you live abroad you walk for coffee and your needs.. Three stars because the peeps working are as friendly as it gets.. but the sugar/condiment bar is dirty.. clean it up Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Dec 2, 2017~Typical 5 am morning coffee run to your local Starbucks but these guys at this location don't really care about your drink order!. I ordered shots of expresso with Carmel drizzle and almond milk. I never got the Carmel drizzle in there and the lady working the drive thru was rude about be charged $3 or something like that for almond milk.  I might as well carry a gallon of almond milk in my car and pour it myself since it's like $2.29 at the grocery store. I usually never get charged for it at different Starbucks locations. This drink that was made tasted like one of the worst I have ever had!. Never be back to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jun 3, 2015~Great new location. Definitely an upgrade from previous location and drive-thru makes it 10 times better. Staff is friendly and very helpful and they go out of their way to assure accuracy with your drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Jul 20, 2014~Decent as every other Starbucks. Staff is friendly and go beyond trying to make the perfect drink for you. Place can get crowded so it might take a while. Some tables and chairs in there for people using the free wifi. Overall nice location. It's nice to get out of the car once in a while to get your coffee which has to be done because there's no drive-thru. Location near my house so I frequently stop by.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Sep 6, 2016~I've been going to Starbucks for YEARS! The barista at this location was horrible. Should have got her name blonde hair Caucasian girl-young. She was having a conversation with another coworker while I'm waiting for my drink! Then she doesn't fill up my cup all the way with my coffee (had nothing to do with adding cream). Then she basically slides my drink across the counter like a cowboy movie and turns her back while it's still sliding!!! Rude!! Won't be back! The cashier Caucasian dark hair with tattoos on her hand and was very nice. But unfortunately rudeness overshadows positivity.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Nov 9, 2018~I've been to this location before and usually enjoy my drinks I love the fraps, not this time though. I asked for a cappuccino with a extra shot. I always get this drink with light foam because I dont want a half cup of foam, the person who made my drink Brook, was complaining about my drink right in front of me! She said it was not a cappuccino and started laughing and talking about my drink it made me very uncomfortable and I do not plan to return again. I took my drink to another store and they made me a different one because who knows what that girl did to my drink. Unprofessional and rude, don't talk about customers where they can hear you! I love starbucks as a company though, the holiday cups are so cute and cream brulee is so good!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 29, 2016~Well, this Starbucks has one of the nicest display areas I've ever seen. It looks so clean and organized. The condiments table was clean and stocked. The employees were alive and friendly at 7:30 in the morning. They were all smiling. The employee who rung me up, T-Rex (on his name tag), was patient when my mind blanked at the register. I failed. I know. There were two people in front of me. I had time. I should've known what I wanted. Nonetheless, he was patient and nice. My drink was perfect. Yup. My grande cinnamon dolce frapp. was yummy-licious. Cinnamon dolce is my go-to drink, and it come in a sugar-free version. I tried the new ancho-chili chicken panini. The flavor was good for a quick, heated up sandwich. I don't know why this place only has three stars!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jul 1, 2017~Great store, staff friendly, get my orders right, though I always seem to have something that's not just plain coffee. I will continue to go to this Starbucks whenever I can.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~May 30, 2015~Just opened near my house and the service is awesome! Frappuccinos all day everyday :D
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Aug 22, 2016~Hey thanks Adam for glaring at me when I asked for a cup of ice and I still said `"thank you so much`" after you you said nothing to me and still no response! So over this place being rude!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Feb 13, 2016~I visit here often and everyone is nice just service is slow  I wait in the drive thru 10-15minutes on average. The other day I went with a Co worker and they forgot to make his drink and he didn't get mad but it was a disappointment when they didn't offer a drink on them.  We patiently waited about 10 mins and they weren't busy
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Oct 3, 2019~This location gets my order wrong EVERY SINGLE TIME, and the partners act like it's an inconvenience to remake the drink they messed up.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Dec 14, 2013~I like what they've done with the place. It accommodates the college students and those who come here to study. Kind of busy parking lot and the mornings are a bear to get in here. Good service
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Aug 14, 2016~I was going to do a 3 star review... but the staff are all so great that I bumped it to a four. The salty 3 star would have been because I have watched this location go from dumpy 19th Ave to a much nicer and larger locale near the I-17 and Northern. It almost seems to me like there are now more homeless/transient folks that like to take their months worth of meds in one sitting and hang out in front of the store in 115 degree heat. I realize they are people too and are simply trying to take a break from the heat, but perhaps use some of your pan handling loot for an actual drink and forego your fix in the spirit of staying cool and hydrated. A slumped over body isn't something I love to see when I am walking up to an establishment! Bless the hearts of the crew at this location for their diligence, I wouldn't have the patience.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Oct 21, 2012~Great service. I was In and out in no time. Wish they had a drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Oct 22, 2019~I just started working in this area and let me tell you I will only be coming to this location. Ann and her team make me feel amazing every time I step into their store. They greet me, ask how my Day is , and say goodbye see you next time. Thank you for making My day!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 10, 2019~i've given this place 3 chances and each trip my drinks tasted like absolute garbage. i honestly thought it was just off days for the baristas but like the this is the only location in my area that has disgusting drinks. best to avoid all together. it's really not worth it.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jul 7, 2019~Well this location just lost our business. I would rather drive across town where I get better customer service. My wife orders the same drink daily and just realized if she orders it a different way it saves me money. She has ordered it that way at various stores with no issue but when we went to this store today that was not the case. I ordered her drink and when we got to the window I asked how much and they said  $6.50ish. We told them that wasn't the right price. We were told that we couldn't order it that way. OK first if all yes we can cause she orders it that way EVERY SINGLE DAY. The lady said `"I'll ring it up the way you ordered it but that's not the correct way and you will have to get it the other way from now on`". Also if I had ordered it the way we had in the past it would still be less than what they were charging today. We often overlook the fact that 9 times out 10 we have to have them remake the drink(we continue to go because it is the closest one to our house) but when the customer service is bad and they try to charge more just because they can we are done. Almost every other Starbucks is happy to correct things if they mess up and happy to help you get a deal especially if you are a regular customer but this one is not. They are rude. We will not be returning to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Mar 14, 2013~Okay, I'm not going to hate on the customer service of this Starbucks because it is WAY better than any of the other stores that are nearby.And I'm not going to hate on their drinks, because it's really hard to mess up an iced coffee (it can be done, but you've really got to try to be lazy)I will, however, hate on the last experience I had there: so I get my coffee, sit down to do some studying and a lady spills her drink outside-- no big deal, the barista heads out to clean up the mess and gets the lady another drink. While she's out there, the barista decides to sweep up the floor in the lobby... this is where I start having a bad day.  When she is sweeping, she is doing these long, swift strokes with the broom and kicking up a LOT of dust, random particles from people's shoes, etc. into the air around me... and she keeps doing this, over and over again until the air around me is pretty much filled with nastiness and I have to actually take off my glasses and clean them.BLECHI wouldn't recommend this place for a sit down study sesh, the one on 19th and Northern is better for that, BUT this bux is BY FAR a better deal when it comes to customer service at the counter or at the hand out-- just be sure to leave before they suffocate you with other people's dead skin, dirt and whatever else is hanging out on that lobby floor.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Jun 5, 2017~This is the fastest starbucks ever! They (were) awesome and when i pulled up to the window i was ready to tell them that and tip them. However i met the RUDEST 20 something ethnic boy in the drive thru this morning. No customer service skills, doesnt say a word, scowls at you and pretty much just throws your change and drink at you. This kid should not be in customer service. Im sorry for low rating starbucks it because of this ONE person. He needs to go.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Apr 23, 2017~I just called this location at 4:10 pm on 4/23. This was the conversation. Barista: normal greetingMe: hello. I was wondering if you have the unicorn frappacino in stock? Barista: no. It is sold out across the U.S.Me: oh, okay. Thank you! Barista: *click*Is this normal Starbucks phone etiquette? It was very abrupt and rude. I didn't even get a `"have a nice day`" or even a GOODBYE!! I won't be visiting this location and I am dissapointed in the customer service. I didn't get the employees name but it was a male.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Apr 12, 2016~This review is for Deena. She is the absolute best!!! I was having such a bad morning( left all my money at home on accident) and she made it all better. Thank you so much!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Sep 24, 2016~Great location! Friendly staff willing to help find merchandise not on display, fast service, clean bathrooms, and great outdoor seating. Also helps that they're open late.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Apr 10, 2018~I frequent this Starbucks on my way to work, it's convenient, and my order is super simple.  Literally two words.  That's one word less than `"cup of coffee`".  I'll show up before 6am so I definitely understand how that schedule can grow... tiresome.  But this stop happens to be my very first human interaction of the day and when I'm greeted with `"Hi, what can I get for you...`" and `"That'll be $2.45 at the first window,`" with a blatant avoidance of such simple pleasantries as: `"how are you`", `"please`", `"thank you`", and `"your welcome`", I can't help but wonder if a simple cup of coffee is more than just a warm, caffeinated shot to the chest.  The possibility that the lifeless hand of a corpse handing me an espresso would offer more warmth than this emotionless community college student working the 4am shift at the Peoria Starbucks does cross my mind.  I wonder if she thinks about me somewhere in between the line breaks on page 122 of Walther von der Vogelweide's `"Under the Linden`" during her 7am lunch break.  Is that rogue spark of consideration an echo of shame, triggering the tiniest notion of empathy?  Nay, the resistance of apathy has created a closed circuit.  She simply closes her book, opens her Instagram feed, and double taps an image of her co-worker, Beth.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Apr 2, 2017~Walked into crumbs and straw wrappers all over the tables and floor. After standing in front of one of the baristas for 5 minutes, saying `"excuse me`" about 3 times, to ask her for a napkin so that I could clean the crumbs off the table, she pointed me to the bar with empty napkin holders. Do yourself a favor, stay in your car and just go through the drive-thru. But hey, my drink was good.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 7, 2017~Best Starbucks I've been to. Good customer service and always a smile on their faces. I've never had a problem with them. Never got my order wrong. Of course there's those long lines. But I've waited longer at other Starbucks before.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Aug 21, 2015~Went into this Starbucks on Peoria and bought $50 in gift cards.... And ask for a free drink ( in California they always give me a free drink when I buy this many gift cards) manager Eddie said No!!! I will not be back to this Starbucks!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Jul 17, 2016~If you're in a hurry don't stop here! As many times as I have been here I've always waited between 5-10+ minutes j t he drive thru waiting for my coffee. Yes only a car or two ahead of me which isn't that long of a line to be waiting 10minutes in. I'm not exaggerating either. It's the only Starbucks near me so I deal with it but come on drive thru get with it. Irritated when walk in is faster than drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Nov 5, 2015~This is the SLOWEST starbucks ever and I use to be a barista. I come here at least three times a week and I am always here at least ten minutes and it doesnt matter if I go through the drive thru or go inside. What makes it worse is that they are joking around like they do not have slow service. Stop joking around and make coffee
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Oct 11, 2015~This is my least favorite Starbucks location that I've been to in Phoenix.HORRIBLE Customer Service and they always get our drinks wrong or they taste terrible. We never ever stop here anymore and wouldn't recommend this Starbucks to anyone., especially when there are so many GREAT Starbucks locations.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Oct 9, 2010~They seldom get your order right and before they do, you might have to repeat yourself two to four times. I used to be a fan of Starbucks but this store is a joke.It also takes a while to get your order ready to go on the bar.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Feb 26, 2018~A piece of advice for everyone...DO NOT GO to this branch. Most starbucks employees are usually pleasant, nice, and helpful but not this location. They don't know how to handle good customer service. I ordered a hot green tea latte on my mobile app and got charged immediately.  When I got there to get my drink,  I was presented with an empty cup. I asked some tall, skinny guy behind the counter why it was empty.  He was too busy to even take the time to explain everything. He just told me they're out of the matcha, like `"too bad lady, try again later.`" A little memo would've been nice before I drove to your store and finding an empty cup on the mobile pick up station. I would have understood that they were out of the matcha green tea but coming in with a rude approach from the staff is not acceptable. The guy didn't even help, or at least told me how I can get my refund on my drink. Bad customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 5, 2015~My co workers and I use this Starbucks a lot. We are there at least once a day to fuel our addiction. Every time we go in there they get our order wrong and instead of fixing the drink they just tell us that's what we ordered. Today when we went through the drive through we asked for separate transactions and Eddie said we were not allowed to do that, so we figured we would do multiple payments at the window. They told us we were not allowed to do that either. They got 2 out of 3 drinks wrong and refused to fix them. Mind you one just needed extra Carmel, and the coffee was burnt. This was the worst customer service I've ever seen. Eddie is very disrespectful if you have a complaint. This was the last straw. No one from our store will be using this location. What's even worse is I could spend all day writing about the awful experiences with them, but can't think of a single time they have been polite and gotten my order right.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Nov 19, 2017~Wow. I have never been so wildly uncomfortable and displeased with a Starbucks experience in all my life...Just for clarification, I have been coming to this location for the past 3 years, as I have lived in the area and have never had a bad experience. Granted, it has been a while, and now tonight I didn't recognize any of the staff. Mainly late 20 year old females, maybe older. One gentleman working as well.It was busy and as the place started to fill up I was contemplating moving, as I was 1 person sitting at a table that sat 4. After a couple groups had cycled through and had not sat down, I finally decided to move to the bar stools along the side of the bar. This is where a gentleman that had spent maybe 20 mins at the counter talking had sat. As I would have done with anyone I'm sitting fairly close to, I asked him if it was ok if I joined him, to which he said it was fine. I was literally there maybe 15 seconds, setting up my computer in silence, when a blonde girl quickly sits down in the bar stool in the middle of the bar between us. Apparently I had sat next to her boyfriend, because she took the next 20 minutes (felt more like an eternity) literally all over him. She was kissing him repeatedly and I have never felt so uncomfortable. I wouldn't have minded if they were just talking, I had put in my headphones anyways because I could tell she was there because of me. But as she kept at it, it became clear she was uncomfortable with me sitting there. By the time she finally left, I was so tense that my neck hurt. I kept checking to see if there was any place I could move to. The only option was outside, which I would have done, but I needed a good connection to the WiFi. I felt bad for this guy because you could tell he was uncomfortable as well. Finally, even though I had a lot to do, I packed up and left. I went to the Barnes and Noble down the street, where I will be coming from now on. There is more that involved a couple other female staff members, one of which blatantly disregarded me when I asked for a glass of water while waiting for my drink. When I asked, she ACTUALLY SHOOK HER HEAD NO. It actually might have been the same girl now that I think about it. Either way, I felt blatantly disrespected. I hope this review is taken into consideration by someone with the ability to make changes. I am just curious where the SM was, and God help this store if that was her.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Oct 19, 2018~My pretty blonde hair barista 'Brookes' had outstanding service today. She recommended my boyfriend and I to try the new fall drink Maple Pecan Latte and the drink is phenomenal. I'm a manager at a multimillion  dollar retail business and she's the kind of girl I need on my team. Thank you management team for hiring such a bright talented young women.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 5, 2017~Love this location, it's my go to everyday place. The staff is always so friendly and is always on point with my drink. The drive thru moves fast and the staff is always eager to work.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Jun 11, 2016~I'm highly disappointed in this location. I've only been to this location twice, and both times it has taken longer than 8 minutes to get my drink. Granted there were a few customers in front of me but it wasn't busy. Bad job Starbucks employees.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jan 3, 2016~I wanted to update my review because a few things changed. The rude barista I spoke of last time changed his whole attitude. He is actually really cool now. Maybe it was because he was new, who knows. This location is still really slow but most of the staff are pleasant.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Nov 23, 2015~Don't go to this location if you're in a hurry. They take so long whether you're in the drive thru or walking in. They've hired a new guy and he has the worst attitude in the world. Blonde young dude.. believe me, you'll come across him.. then there's another dude that's been at the new location for a while who's also jerkish.. besides those two, the staff is pretty cool. Like I said, in a hurry, steer clear.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Aug 31, 2015~Bad service and my coffee was half whip cream and I didn't have any bacon on my bacon and cheese Gouda literally one corner has a TINY piece of bacon totally ruined my Monday high. Waste of 9.42 cent.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~May 6, 2015~This recently opened replacement location (just west of former store) presents a far superior experience to its predecessor. Plenty of windows and a high ceiling accentuate the light that is a plus of living in Phoenix. Far more outdoor seating than previous store, as well. Staff was very friendly and efficient. There seems to be a mix of former store staff and new partners. Tiffanie was the barista for cafe customers during my recent visit, and she could not have displayed a more genuinely friendly and professional spirit. I give this four stars based on all my visits to this location, thus far, but wish there was a 4.5 rating.

Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 30, 2018~I can't say enough about how awesome the morning crew is at this Starbucks! I usually come at least 4 times a week and around 6-7:30 and they have the nicest people working.  Hope the manager sees this and lets them know that I greatly appreciate their smiles in the am and always how friendly they are! By the way the manager is super nice too and I apologize that I don't know your name but you and the morning crew is why I keep coming back
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Mar 30, 2017~Absolutely the best Starbucks I've been to since we moved here. O'Hara and Jacqueline are amazing, always super friendly and quick with a smile! I always feel very welcome when I stop in here. My White Chocolate Mocha is always spot on - service is quick and drive thru is always very fast!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jul 2, 2015~This is such a wonderful Starbucks. The staff is very friendly and polite. The dining room is clean as well as the restrooms. The food and drinks here are great. I really like it here.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 15, 2015~I asked for a green tea with light ice sweetened. I got a green tea unsweetened. When they remade it they added extra ice and I got a nice 4 cup of ice.  My uncle ordered a drink and in the time my drink was remade and completely drank his drink still wasn't made. After complaining to the management (Eddie) they still didn't make it. We were waiting 30 mins on one starbucks frapp. He was extremely rude! I've never had this bad of service at a starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Nov 28, 2015~When customers pay $4-5 dollars for coffee, you should train your employees to not be rude or demeaning to customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jan 10, 2015~I was here visiting this starbucks on Peoria off the 17 freeway this is the location I always stop to get my Favorite beverage a cm I have incountered a cashier Nikolai he makes my day when I see him . I love the staff her but especially Nikolai wonderful young man wanted to give him some wonderful feedback awesome young man!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 3, 2017~I usually like Starbucks but the people who work at this location are rude as can be. Dutch Bros is way better!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 12, 2018~Went thru the drive thru The guy that was helping at first then some one else jumped in so rude to me I'm a gold member and this was the second time coming not happy will not come here again and did not want to take my gold card
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jun 27, 2015~The line here is atrocious for the drive thru. Your best bet is just to park behind and walk in. No ones in there.  So unless you have a kid in your backseat, jump out. The staff is fun and friendly. The new app that I downloaded has helped a lot, even earned a free coffee. Wish it was all built in the app but I had to show my card etc etc. small tech kinks still to work out.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Apr 10, 2016~To start off, this Starbucks isn't the worst one but it isn't the greatest. Some employees are very rude and slow while others are extremely helpful. I only come back because its so close to my job and my co-workers say a guy name Nick brings them back as well. For me, I've had a nice lady help me out who always looks like a `"pin up girl`".
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jul 20, 2015~Alyssa is a rock star with her customer service.  We have never seen her before so she may be a new employee.  From the moment we are helped, with our orders, she smiled, and listened to our requests, and made sure my name is spelled correctly on my coffee cup, not many people ask and when they do, I appreciate it.  More importantly, my coffee was made the way I like it and Starbucks really do stand behind making our coffee or drink the way we like it. This is one of my favorite location and I am happy to return again and again..keep up the great customer service skills and training Starbucks!!  BRAVO!!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Nov 27, 2015~Very friendly staff.  Busy but lines moves quickly.  My latte made perfectly!  Would totally recommend when looking for your coffee fix!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Nov 14, 2015~I should have known from the yelp reviews that this Starbucks would be slow, but I didn't think it would take 30 Minutes to get two drinks. I will give them the benefit of the doubt due to the Saturday morning rush, in which the Drive Thru was full and there were twenty plus people inside, BUT it is ridiculous that people that came in after me were served before me. The drive Thru was obviously more important than the people inside. It came to the point were we had to go up there and ask for our drinks, so if you want quick service either cut down 10 Minutes by going through the drive Thru or stand at the counter and Check in on your drink every 5 Minutes or so. On the bright side, my Oprah Chai Latte was good and the baristas were very friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Dec 4, 2011~Definitely need more help in the mornings.  There is one lady who when I see her doing the drinks, I do not get anything that day.  She is slow and always seems like she doesn't know what she is doing.  I only love it when the young girls are working drinks.  Never ever come between 7-8:30 am, expect to wait 30 mins to get out.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Apr 25, 2015~The new location is nice but it is no longer convenient! You now have to drive to the location instead of walking there from the other shops. Seems like a all new staff missing that extra customer service the other location had. All business no personality! Outdoor patio is very large but very uncomfortable with the ridiculous loud drive-thru speaker that completely ruins any relaxation or concentration. Very disappointing!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jul 18, 2015~Great location. Thanks for the drive thru! I enjoy ordering from the app and have my drinks ready upon arrival!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Mar 29, 2015~They didn't even know how to make a simple passion tes. They wait was really long and they were everywhere very unorganized! I go to Starbucks everyday and I get the same drinks everyday and I know exactly how it's made and they tried to argue with me.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Jan 5, 2016~I tried to get a replacement drink for one that they made that tasted like soap or chemicals. I wasn't able to get back to that location for 2 weeks due to work and travel. When I tried to get my replacement drink the store manager Tiffany, I believe, was extremely rude and treated me like I was lying and a thief trying to get a free drink. How many people call complaining of soap/chemical taste. She took my complaint over the phone. 2 weeks isn't long enough to forget a complaint that specific. I had to call Starbucks corporate to have my drink replaced. They agreed she should have just replaced the drink and apologized for her. Her fake smile rockabilly sweet looks are no good if you're hideous on the inside. Just saying.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Nov 25, 2013~Everything they do they do with a smile. Fun and friendly baristas. Knowledgeable and informative when asked about a tumbler cup they had on sale. I'm looking for a trenta size refillable cup and they informed me I can actually use their cup they give and I'll get the discount. Thank you Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Nov 13, 2014~This location usually has a low wait time and the drinks are made well. There is a very friendly male barista who works super early; unfortunately, I don't know his name - but he's awesome!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Sep 10, 2017~Haley was so rude and extra snobby. Her hair looked like she hadn't looked in the mirror before work !!! I'm so disgusted by this employee I will definitely not be going to this location any more. !! Dear management try to pick em a little better
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Aug 31, 2015~Thank you Deena (hope spelling is right)!  No one could ask for better Customer Service than what Deena showed me. I had forgotten my credit card at home didn't realize it until I pulled up to the window.  I told Deena to please cancel my order that I had forgotten my card.  She said well we aren't going to let you leave without your coffee for the day.  I have never experienced such kindness at any store/restaurant ever.  Little did she know I had car trouble the night before and had to get it fixed before my week started and I was running on 3 hours of sleep. So I really did need my coffee. Thank you so much for your kindness.  To some a cup of coffee is not a grand gesture but it was Deena's kindness that was.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Aug 25, 2015~I cannot imagine a more poorly laid out location. This is worse than when they were in the strip mall portion of this complex. Very little parking and hard to get in and out of. Staff is annoyed if you have questions and my order was wrong 2 of 2 visits. Thanks, but no more for me here!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Dec 15, 2014~Average location in just about every way. A little small and slightly awkward layout, but staff is friendly and customer service is on-par with other locations.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Aug 9, 2011~I still hate coffee. Why Starbucks then you ask? Easy. Smoothies and muffins. 1 extra star off for being on the west side. Ba-zing!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Feb 23, 2019~I just left this Starbucks and I'm frustrated. I went through the drive through this morning and ordered my normal drink: grande hot americano with 3 raw sugars, cinnamon and cream. When I got to the window I waited about 3 minutes for my drink which wasn't a big deal to me, they were really busy. But I kept hearing the girl at the window say `"do you have my americano?`" `" I just need the americano`" so when she handed me my drink I figured I better double check and make sure it was made right since they were probably rushing... I asked her very kindly, `"it for sure has the cinnamon in it?`" She looks at me, reads off of the sticker and says `"yeah, it has three raw sugar, extra cream and cinnamon`" (I could have read off of the sticker myself, I wanted to make sure that it was inside). So I go `"okay! Great! Thanks!`" I get down the road and take one sip... no cinnamon, no raw sugar and it's still dark brown with barely any cream. So I make a uturn, and go back. I'm not super upset but I'm a little annoyed at this point. So I say `"can you just make me a black americano and now that I'm inside, I'll just put the fixings in myself?`" and a different girl goes well I can just put the stuff in for you now. And I'm like.... okay. She does, I taste it again and it's just bad. It doesn't even taste like there's espresso in it. Let alone the 3 shots it should have, there's no crema and it tastes like cinnamon water. I say do you mind just remaking it for me? I'm just not a fan of how it tastes. With a heavy sigh and a glare up at me she literally says `"well your gonna have to wait because I have a lot of drinks in front of you`" REALLY?! I just went through the drive through, asked y'all to double check, you said it was right... you lied. And now I'm back in the store, I'm asking you to kindly remake my drink that you messed up. (You kind of messed it up twice!) and now instead of saying of course! I'm so sorry about that! Your upset at me for wanting the correct drink that I ordered 15 minutes ago?! I'm not usually one to write a complaint and I've worked at a coffee shop so I understand it gets stressful and things get forgotten in the drinks... but the way everything was handled was poor. She should have actually double checked that there was cinnamon and sugar in the drink when I asked and she should have been a little more understanding of why I would be asking her to remake the drink. I wasn't trying to be a pest, I was trying to get the drink that I had just paid for, correct.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Feb 19, 2015~Most disorganized poorly ran Starbucks I've ever been to in my life. I ordered my normal drink and stepped back from the counter, and after 10 minutes never received my order or heard my name called. I finally went up to ask the lady what was wrong. She said oh! Your drinks been done for 5 minutes. I asked her when, they were gonna let me know, she said we've been calling your name. I said how do you know my name you never even asked for my name? She said we got it off your credit card. It felt rather odd and impersonable I thought. She then told me that I was standing in the wrong spot and should know where the coffees picked up at. I told her I was standing here all this time watching, and listening. It took another 10 minutes for the girl to figure out how to refund my money... All in all, 20 minutes out of my day, stay far away from this Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~3~Jun 4, 2014~Decent as far as Starbucks go. Kinda have to wait a while for things to come out even when they are not super busy.. Not bad at all just leave a bit to be desired.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Aug 28, 2014~This is my favorite store in the valley and I have visited more than should be normal. I go out of my way to visit this store because every barista, morning or evening, offer consistent service and quality beverages. They follow correct Starbucks routines and truly care about their customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Dec 31, 2014~My favorite coffee shop, great costumer service, the only bad thing about this place is the parking lot!
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~May 30, 2017~I am extremely dissatisfied with the service here, I tried ordering my expresso venti  that I usually order from other Starbucks with no problems, but at this location they didn't  understand what I was saying and the girl working the drive through was impatient and rude and the manager was not listening to what I was saying, I would not recommend this location. I would go lower than one star if I could.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Apr 25, 2015~Over-priced, fancy-schmancy coffee served by snotty, condencending  kids. Not worth it.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Apr 9, 2015~Used to frequent this spot a lot but the staff changed and they're just not as nice...moved on to a local spot a little closer to work...
Phoenix, AZ 85029~5~Jun 28, 2014~I love this starbucks always fast and friendly they make the drinks amazing every time I go in my drinks taste the exact same never off .... Love the manager always has a smile on her face when you walk in ....
Phoenix, AZ 85029~1~Aug 27, 2016~This Starbucks has the worst service ever. I went in on a Saturday afternoon. It was very busy and you could tell in the employees faces they were tired. However it doesnt excuse how I was treated. I ordered a simple Trenta passion tea. I arrived at 12:04pm. I was put at 12:34pm. When I was handed my drink the employee saud trenta passion but handed me a venti. I advised this was the wrong size and the girl that was behind the counter said `"fine! We will make it again!`" then afyer her very rude comment waited an additional 5 min to ask someone to make it. I had no ice it wasnt sweetened. I have never had this bad of service at a Starbucks. Needless to say i will never return to this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85029~4~Jun 3, 2015~Free puppiccino for your dog (ice and whip cream)...nice outdoor seating, about 9 tables with shade and mist
Phoenix, AZ 85029~2~Feb 9, 2014~I've been coming to this Starbucks for years I've always had such a pleasant experience Tiffany the manager has always been so nice to me and my family! But ever since the girl named gray has started working there my experience has been nothing but terrible! She has been rude to me on several occasions I've complained to the manager and I won't complain to her anymore because I do not want a free drink all I'm asking for is for gray to pleasant to me when I go and buy my drink at six am! She has an Issue with me and I'm not sure why! She refuses to make my drink right and when I ask her to make it correctly she always come back with a snotty remark she make me feel as if I'm a bother to her. I just want one simple thing done I want my drink that I paid for made correctly! Because of the way I am treated by gray I will no longer come to this Starbucks neither will my friends and family I refuse to be treated with such disrespect again!
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Jul 14, 2024~Best Starbucks in the valley! The manager greets me often and always gives off positive vibes. All the workers seem to love there job. Plus my drink is always filled with caramel!!!! My go too is a venti caramel macchiato with extra extra caramel and blonde espresso
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Sep 15, 2022~The majority of the time the Starbucks is missing pretty much everything that a college student could want in the morning. I had an interaction with a manager who is completely rude. I'm shocked that she's managing a business where customer service is not only a high priority but required. The reason this gets even two stars is because the student workers are all very sweet and always very friendly.  They never fail to greet you with a smile and ensure you get the best drink or food you can with the minimal amount of options they can provide.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Jan 20, 2019~Just grabbed a Java chip frap to keep myself up tonight, thanks to Miles for making the first tasty one I've had since finding out I have milk allergy and had to switch to coconut milk! Love you Miles!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Nov 18, 2017~I see why this location gets bad reviews now. This is my first one star review I have wrote on yelp.I came in to find workers talking about how they don't care about their jobs at Starbucks and the only reason they are working here is for the free education. They were so engrossed in their conversation that I had to make my presence known for them to notice that I was there.The previous week I came in at 9:15 PM, that's 45 minutes before they close, and ordered my girlfriend's favorite drink that I was going to bring back to her. I was told that `"I already cleaned the machine that is used to make the drink`". Then I replied `"But you don't close for another 45 minutes`". His response to that was he would have to clean the machine again if he made my drink so he wasn't going to do that. So, I left and went to the location one mile down the road and got my drink there with no issues.It really seems like many of the individuals working here don't care about their jobs, give continued poor customer service and do as little as possible just so they get free education.After the continued bad experience here I am going avoid this location and would encourage others to do the same. Just go to the better run locations, like the one that is one mile away.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Oct 26, 2022~this starbucks should just close at this point, they never have anything, how do you not have cold brew or cream or mocha as a coffee shop? it's getting ridiculous
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Feb 18, 2020~I come in twice a week and love the environment! Always see my favorite barista, Richard and he is always friendly to my group. We joke he is an icon because he feels apart of the group now. Give Richard a raise!!!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Sep 27, 2019~Stopped in yesterday while at the ASU west campus, it was my first visit. The line was long but seemed to be going quickly so we decided to get an afternoon pick me up. I got to the counter to order and the individual who took my order immediately seemed annoyed or stressed, I asked for a grande iced green tea lemonade and before he started writing on the cup I said `"you know what let's do a venti if you would?`" He then seemed even more annoyed at which time he grunted as if it was a pain to grab the larger cup when he hadn't even written on the grande. I then went to scan my phone and he said `"whoa hold on!`" All in all, he needs to be better trained in customer service and act as if it is more of a pleasure to take someone's order than a hassle. My drink came out a few minutes later and it is a venti green tea latte? I let the nearest barista know that I had actually ordered a green tea lemonade, she didn't say anything to me and turned to the other barista and let her know what to make..a couple minutes later the younger barista placed my correct drink on the bar (somewhat aggressive) and the other one let me know that I could take both drinks and give one to someone I know. It was very bizarre and nothing like what I am used to from Starbucks. For starters they made me feel like the drink mistake was my fault which was weird...then didn't even apologize or anything (despite the fact that they actually charged me for a more expensive drink?)I am not one to complain and honestly I don't make things like this a big deal. If the drink order was incorrect but they handled it better it would have been no sweat off my back..it was just my interaction with the entire staff that rubbed me the wrong way. Honestly I would avoid this Starbucks and go to one off campus (even if it's not as convenient!)
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Feb 13, 2017~Idk why this place has gotten a higher star rating, seems crazy to me!! The Barista at the window was super friendly and helped me out a lot. I'm not a big coffee drinker so I don't frequent here a lot, but this is a really nice clean place.
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Aug 31, 2017~Mediocre service on taking my order but then the little dark haired curly girl serving decided to do 3 other orders before completing mine. Terrible service!!!
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~May 19, 2018~My favorite Starbucks to hang out at! My service animal is also allowed in and loved, which is important to me. Thanks for all the delicious coffee!
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Feb 23, 2018~Being an ASU student, I'm on campus constantly and use the campus Starbucks for a pick me up of coffee daily. The employees are usually very pleasant and get my order out ASAP and correctly! I usually get a coffee and some banana bread- my go to items!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Sep 4, 2016~Don't waste your time or money here. I live for Starbucks but this place is crazy.  The drive thru is super full so I walked in. Ton of space inside.  Surprised not one person was in there. Ryan happily helped me and wanted to charge me almost $4.00 for a cup of coffee.  I asked him why it was so much and he started reading off everything. He said they charge for creamer.  Keep driving to the next one. Ryan doesn't know what he is doing.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Nov 19, 2017~I'll choose this Starbucks over all other ones! Staff are super friendly, service is efficient and drinks are always top notch. I've witnessed them change drinks for customers that weren't satisfied multiple times.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Apr 6, 2017~The fact that I have never written a Yelp review before, regardless of how awful the experience was, and now I am writing the my first one, tells you about how disappointed I am with this branch. Some workers seem to have a little trouble with understanding the concept of customer service. Although it is at a college setting and can be a little more `"relaxed`" than if it were off-campus, it is expected that the employees still treat their customers with respect whether they are a student, a staff member, or whatever the case may be. I barely know these baristas and they play around and joke with me like they have known me for years, which to some extent I tolerate but it can sometimes be very frustrating and plain disrespectful. Instead of saying that they have the right to refuse service when clearly they had initiated the altercation, they might want to try apologizing. People with common sense know better not to mess with someone who is hungry, to which I did give a warning.
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Nov 19, 2013~Disappointed in this Starbucks. Employees had little knowledge of menu, pricing of pastries,  and got my drink wrong. A simple hot coffee. I would rather drive further to a different location than to this one. The only reason it got 2 stars was because the cashier was polite and the premade bliss bar was good.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Aug 23, 2017~This place is terribly disorganised. The employees are unprofessional and inept. Spend your money elsewhere.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Sep 4, 2016~Horrible horrible!! Venti pikes place with 3 pumps of white mocha and an inch of cream. Almost $4. They charge for a pump of white mocha in your coffee.  Fine. I get it. Gotta keep the lights on right?! I asked why it's so much and they said they had to charge me for the cream.  So it's  $1.20 to add white mocha and cream to a black coffee.  Wow. Floored. Never coming back.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 2, 2023~Great SBUX! Clean, amazing staff, well laid out. Noice!I am visiting PHX and the quality of this store at this location was a very pleasant surprise.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jul 3, 2022~No line for some reason and I zipped through to enjoy an iced caramel drink for about 5 bucks, which is the low end price of almost all grande beverages now. This was cold, had the right amount of cream,but the caramel needed to be stirred. If you choose the no straw, then stirring becomes difficult.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 10, 2024~can never get my simple drink right, all i ask for is a strawberry açaí refresher with no strawberries and extra base, the worker ALWAYS fails to add the extra base and makes sure it's watered down completely. today was the last straw and i will no longer be going to this crappy location, i recommend you take your money and do the same.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 5, 2019~Great Starbucks! There's a drive thru! Love the caramel frap. But there's a lot of choices lattes, cold brews, frappuccino's and teas. Download the app to start making ur order online and it will be done by the time u drive there. Also there's always star dashes going on to earn more stars to earn free drinks or food.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 15, 2022~Great service, clean, friendly baristasWhen coming in I was greeted and felt welcomed
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 27, 2020~Wow. That's literally all I can say. I went to this location this morning to get myself and my son drinks and breakfast. My gift card didn't work, no worries, whatevs.... but they didn't even start my drinks (talking where I could hear them talking about how they won't start them until they know I could pay for them, so rude) then I sat at the window after paying cash for ten minutes while they make my order.... all the while goofing around and being inappropriate with each other, then finally my drink came out.... wrong. I ordered it iced, when I said something, one of the girls inside rudely said `"well then she should have ordered it iced`" loudly... Then the manager Zulma came to give me a refund.... not only was she not wearing her mask over her nose, she was barely any help at all and let the lady inside keep yelling rude things... I could hear them through the headset as she was wearing. When I asked for the store manager, the girl who was rude to begin with literally sneered `"looks like you'll have to come back in a week, she's on vacation, he name is Jo, I can give you my card for when you complain about me`" Zulma barely even tried to get her to stop verbally harassing a customer.... If I could give zero stars I would... there are so many Starbucks in the same area... choose a different location...
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Mar 2, 2018~The cup has runneth over. Lived near this store for over a year and every time I find myself regretting it. Thats pretty sad right because it's Starbucks. What happened Starbucks? It seems as though the Starbucks customer service here is inexistent. The employees seem to have a very low morale as if no one there wants to be there and the drinks made mirrors that. I truly believe this store likes good leadership, its almost as if no one wants to really work there. I've never been to a Starbucks where they don't seem happy, I was under the impression the hiring process involved a picking of personalities that are chipper. This store for the past year has lacked personality. Where is the love? The seating in this store is a full 4 stars small, its small but it makes do with the square footage that they have. If you plan to bring a computer and sit at the long table the many outlets are under the table so be sure to look. The drinks seem to lack love, over multiple occasions I've gotten drinks with others and the drinks taste extremely similar. I usually ALWAYS order through the app, my recommendation is you download the Starbucks app and make purchases through it as you will receive TONS of bonuses and free drinks. It's unfortunate this Starbucks couldn't FILL the cup up, I expected more. This store lacks smiles and spirit, one day I hope that changes.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jan 19, 2022~I give 3 stars for this visit. 1 star off because I got ZERO drizzle on my caramel machiatto, pretty simple order. No dog treats on any of my 3 puppaccino. They were upset about that, theres the other star. I think the simplest orders are the most important to hit the mark on. A good correct coffee in the morning sets the day right, but a wrong one you will think about longer.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 24, 2022~Omg if I ever need to recommend a awesome starbucks it's this one. The people- outstanding kind and sweet, as well as make drinks so fast you'll be in and out. Nissa was so awesome and went the extra mile! Def go here yall, it's amazing!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 3, 2021~I love how this Starbucks always makes it right. Too much ice? Ask for light ice.  Danish not to your liking?  Ask for a remake. Drinks are guaranteed so if you dont like it just ask for a remake. Seems like some people just love to complain.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 11, 2022~I've been ordering from this Starbucks through Postmates a lot the last couple of months and never had an issue. Yesterday morning I ordered a sugar free vanilla iced coffee and it was BAD. It tasted like one of the ingredients was bad but I'm not sure which one, most likely the syrup because it tasted extremely fermented. I had two other people try it and they both had the same reaction.  Not sure I'll order from here again because that was a complete waste of my money.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 26, 2021~I asked for a double toasted cheese danish and the first one I got wasn't cooked at all, the second one was torched! Horrible Starbucks...couldn't even make a simple iced caramel macchiato correctly. Don't go to this one! 0 STARS!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~May 24, 2016~Not sure why other reviewers had such bad service here. Maybe I came in a good day. My coffee was made super fast even though there were cars lined up around the corner outside. Minus one star due to dirty tables outside. I hate cleaning tables when I'm out; I do that enough at home.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 8, 2020~This is the only Starbucks I've had delivery from that does NOT secure the delivery items before providing to the delivery driver. What is wrong with you??? Follow Starbucks and safety guidelines and have some common decency - don't leave food items to the open air of a delivery driver during a pandemic when it's easy enough to tape the bag. It's a waste of $40. Extremely disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Mar 3, 2021~Ok I'm giving 4 stars because most of my experiences at this location have been great. The staff are great. But today I was extremely disappointed in paying $12 for two drinks that were 99% ice. All ice no drink. 3 sips and they were GONE. So sad.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 7, 2019~Time for an update. I usually make coffee at home, however once in a while I run out and have to hit this Starbucks for my morning cup of coffee. Everything is on point compared to when I first reviewed back in 2013. Their coffee tastes good, service is great and they always offer my dog a puppicino.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Mar 10, 2013~Closest Starbucks to my house and the WORST Starbucks in town! They mess up the simplest of orders and have attitude when they can't figure out how to fix a problem. I have to drive an extra 5 minutes to the next closest Starbucks(40th and Greenway) but it is worth it because they are awesome-always get it right-and their coffee does not taste like I licked an ashtray!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 7, 2018~Great Starbucks. Watch out for this ass hole that frequents this Starbucks. He is rude and acts like he wants to fight no matter if your a woman or a man and he has a Veyo magnet on his card. See three photos of him in the photo line up.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 3, 2021~This location is great! I have been a loyal customer for a few years and even with a manager change they are still on their A Game. There are still a few great old schoolers left like Neil and Tiffany and I'm sure a few others I'm blanking on, then there are newer baristas like Joseph and Kim who know how to do all the right things in the customer service oriented business. By far the best and my favorite of all of the valley Starbucks locations. Keep up the great work everyone!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 27, 2016~Not all Starbucks are created equal but this one is one of my favorites!The store and bathroom is always clean. The coffee drinks are always spot on and consistent. The staff is always warm and welcoming and treat you like a friend. Depending on which way I'm traveling I may not stop here but when I'm in N Phoenix this is my go to!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~May 24, 2017~This a busy location because it's near the 51 freeway. The employees are always nice and greet you are out a smile. Even when the drive thru line is super long or once a customers vehicle stalled out and held up the drive thru, the employees were super nice and accommodating. Last week Mia was a gem at the drive thru. She started a nice conversation with me while I waited for my order. Great customer service!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 11, 2017~This Starbucks Rocks! They always have my drink ready quickly when I order ahead! Also they keep the drive-thru moving in the am (unlike some stores where they put the `"B`" team on at busiest times).
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Mar 16, 2015~This is my go to Starbucks and I have never been disappointed. The employees are all very nice and friendly. I love that there is a drive thru which makes it easy to get to go. To me the drive thru is pretty quick.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 14, 2020~Just love this place .What a clean open fast paced environment The staff was very friendly and was efficient at getting my order right &amp; I was  impressed at how fast the staff moved right through the line with ease . The  employees work together and lift the whole environment on such a  positive note. The sitting area has plenty of space to sit down and enjoy your goodies while catching up on your laptop or tablet they offer Free wifi Bonus locations great plus I've yet to see a line in the drive through. The coffee is delish and the service is  worthly and they even WROTE my name on my cup . Definitely have my loyal customer vote I'm a patron . Recommend for everyone , family environment and there's something for everyone .I've been to several of there locations and there everywhere I stand by in saying all there locations are the same and keep the same standers of service in my experience with them Thank you again very pleased customer
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 6, 2015~Drinks aren't consistent, and the employees are always rude. I'm surprised Dutch brothers hasn't put them out of business... Yet If I'm paying 5$ for a drink I'm expecting it to be perfect. When I took my drink back they told me I didn't purchase the drink from there location and unless I had the receipt they couldn't replace it...I still haven't been back
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 12, 2019~So I go to this Starbucks daily at 32nd St. and Bell and normally it's awesome everyone is really friendly my mobile order is ready on time. Today I picked up my mobile order and there was a new face the gentleman was nice handed me my drink and then turned around and bent over and now I am faced with his green boxer shorts because his bluejeans are below his ass. Seriously Starbucks? You can't make your help at least wear jeans up at their waist rather than below their underwear?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Oct 1, 2018~This location was pretty busy when I went on a Friday morning.  There are no comfortable seats to sit and relax, read or work.  All wooden chairs.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 10, 2015~Tall guy with blonde hair that works there has no personality. Never has. He may hate his job but it is his job to fake it and if you can't then customer service isn't for you. This guy is never happy every time I go in. Normally I don't care but he's ruining the barista reputation. He messed up my drink, didn't give me my current change back and then acted like I was ruining his life by asking for the correct change. Starbucks needs to fix this. It's embarrassing.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 26, 2015~Went to Starbucks to get a Trenta Black Ice Tea while I was placing my order I let the lady know (heather) I wanted extra water so it wasn't to strong.Pulled up to the window only to find a dark strong tea. I said can you please put more water with an attitude heather said `"it is a black tea you know`" and walked away. Heather came back with a tea that she didn't even add water to and I said I don't want the tea and I don't like your attitude she said `"good for you bye`". So my husband pulled forward and I went inside for the managers number the woman who working he purchase counter gave me a car and was very nice.Needless to say I notified corporate and will call the store manager tomorrow.Heather is very rude and needs to find a new job not in customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 7, 2018~Bathrooms were disgusting. Behind the bar was also dirty. They didn't label coffees so people that came after me kept taking mine. I finally got mine and it tasted disastrous. 4 dollars down the drain. I'm going to dutch brothers from here.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jun 12, 2020~The barista was very sweet but I would avoid this Starbucks until they let their customers use the bathrooms. I understand there's a virus going around but if they're really that concerned for our safety then they should shut the place down until it doesn't exist anymore... So forever. Or they can stop using the excuse of `"we can't let you use the bathrooms because of the coronavirus`". It literally doesn't make any sense that you will take our money and hand us food and drink but not let us use the bathroom. Starbucks and their politics. So frustrating.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jun 4, 2018~This location is really hit or miss. I come *almost* every morning, and maybe 1/4 of the time my order is wrong. Also, you'd think they take time to know their regulars--- nope! There are a couple friendly people that work the drive through counter--- but I'm not impressed. I don't need the overboard `"Dutch bros`" friendly, but a hello and smile could go a long way.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Mar 31, 2017~As good as any other Starbucks - which is to say overpriced but of high quality. Fast friendly service.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 29, 2018~Good Starbucks, drinks alway taste right.  Good folks in that store who want to take care of you.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 15, 2018~Horrible customer service. I tried paying with large bill, they had no change! I offered to pay partially in change and come back and pay the rest. They much rather trash the already made beverage than to keep customer happy. I rather go across the street to the Starbucks inside Fry's or even better Kings independently and locally owned coffee shop on 32nd St and Union Hills.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 25, 2017~I am always disappointed when I leave this location. Unfortunately, it is closest to my job so I have no time to drive further before work. The drive-thru line gets jammed often, but that it isn't the real issue. I used to be a manager for Starbucks and I worked in all types of stores, so I know how operations go. My drinks are rarely correct &amp; I order uncomplicated recipes. Vanilla latte with whipped cream? No whipped cream. 1/2 sweet mocha? Made with 4 pumps and too sweet. We can't leave work to go back and have these drinks corrected, so we deal with it. I know what Starbucks is capable of and I really wish this location would improve. Staff is normally kind, but efficiency needs some serious work.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Mar 3, 2015~My second favorite coffee shop in the north valley, they are really fast. I would recommend the peppermint mocha or the skinny vanilla latte
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~May 30, 2012~Small inside, but they also have a drive through. I love this Starbucks because its such a convenient location, right before the 51.I came a couple times to study before school and used the free wifi, They still offer the free iTunes cards too. I'm a rare person who drinks tea from here, so my drinks aren't expensive (in the $2-$4 range) whether it's hot or iced.I haven't had any issues with the baristas.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 15, 2013~A friendly staff, great location, and big inside.  This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations.  Well the one on 16th and Bethany is my favorite, but this one is up there...!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 13, 2016~Not even a 1-  inside cashier pleasant but drive thru baristas very rude. So however was working 8/13/16 at 11:50am, put a smiley face on and be happy.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 1, 2016~This Starbucks has employees that are extremely rude. I asked for extra Carmel drizzle and instead of putting extra they left it out. I went back inside and asked them to put Carmel in it and put a little more than normal. The girl gave me a dirty look and proceeded to fill the cup 1/3 of the way with Carmel making it undrinkable. I wasn't rude when I asked so I don't understand why I was treated like that. I definitely won't be back here.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 14, 2015~Agree with previous posters the customer service is terrible don't even know their own promotions very disappointed especially when you spend $7 for a cup of coffee, someone needs to manage up this location and manage out these employees who act so rudely.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 26, 2017~Early morning today, I bought a vanilla soy latte at this locations. I drink soy because I am severely lactose intolerant. I went to work and half an hour after drinking the latte, I ran to the bathroom. The latte was the only thing I ate therefore I believe that by accident the barista put regular milk. Not only did I pay $.65 for it but got sick too!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 21, 2016~How does a `"Coffee Master`" (embroidered on their aprons) not know that they sell prepared 8-cup presses of COFFEE ready to serve in a Clover-Reserve location and has to call a district manager to ask if they sell them and how prepare them?!? You grind 8-10 tablespoons of beans with 'press' as a preset mode on the actual grinder, add hot water to the top of the black part of the press, set a timer for 4 minutes, and press down when the time is up. Instructions are on the French presses you sell! Teach your `"Coffee Masters`" to make a simple press of coffee before teaching them to master `"handcrafted beverage`" junk.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 24, 2015~My bf and i went there on christmas eve and the girl at the register was the sweetest cashier we encountered. I did not catch her name but we went at 9:57am when everyone decided to show up and everyone was swift and very nice. I am very happy with the service and product! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 29, 2018~i'm always hesitant to go to other stores, because as a 2.5 year partner i get the quality has gone down. this store surprised me with quick drive times and while maintaining great customer service!! thank you so much for keeping the quality of stores at a high, all stores should look at this one as an example
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 3, 2015~This is my go to Starbucks. Staff is always friendly and easy going. Most people need to realize that it takes some time to make orders, the drive thru can get long but it's worth the wait in my opinion. Always clean and plenty of seating. I frequent this store about once a week.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Feb 1, 2017~Too bad the door slams really very loudly and the wonderful and inviting work table has 2 rows of NONFUNCTIONAL electrical outlets.  Clean and comfortable otherwise.  Too bad they don't repair these two annoying issues.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 6, 2017~Avoid this Starbucks, ordered my mobile order and took 10 minutes, most other locations I can order 5 minutes ahead (like I did), walk in and skip the line.  After I asked she looked at the cup that was set aside and set it after people who ordered after me! On top of that there were 4 other customers who got their drinks wrong in the time I waited. I've been here a few times after class and never have a good experience. The only reason I went this time is cause the person driving me only wanted to make a fast stop.. I was wrong about fast that's for sure! I felt like an ass making the person driving me wait so long. I'll never come back, not worth the service as wait, plus the drink wasn't even that great
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 8, 2015~If I can give it negative stars I would. I have never been to such a terrible location ever. They were beyond rude and careless at this location. I watched 6 people get their drinks ahead of me. A few customers mentioned it happens all the time. When I mentioned that I still hadn't received my drink the barista rolled her eyes and said out loud that I hadn't received my drink. I stood there watching as they worked on other people's drinks not seeming to attempt to make mine even after it was announced that I hadn't received mine. I get fed up and at this point I'm already late for my appointment with a client so I tell them I want a refund and that I do not even care about the drink. Barista then turns around grabs the drink stating someone moved it and forgot about it. I tell them I'm very unhappy and that this has been a bad experience...in a very uncaring tone, eyes rolling again she just says sorry. As im walking out very upset one of the other Baristas (I'm assuming he was the supervisor since he was not wearing the green apron) shouts in a sarcastic demeaning tone HAVE A GOOD DAY and gives a chuckle. Asking if he was serious. He continued to have a smirk on his face as he chuckled. Told them this is the worst Starbucks I have ever been too and that the customer service is terrible...Barista screamed BYE in a joyful tone. I have never been so disgusted by a business like I was today. It was so bad that it left a bad taste in my mouth for Starbucks in general. I hope that if I decide to go back to a different Starbucks that they can restore my faith.In case you want to say drinks take a while to make take into consideration I only asked for an iced green tea and the 6 drinks from different people standing behind me got their drinks before me.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 18, 2016~Great service and always fast and friendly especially in the drive thru. My everyday stop to start my day.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 13, 2013~Fast in the drive thru....awesome service. baristas are so friendly and nice
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 28, 2018~An amazingly friendly staff! I went on Black Friday through the drive thru and the server was so cheery and patient with me as I scrambled to get me electronic pay to work. After about 5 mins of sheer panic on my part, the sweet server said she paid for me. I couldn't believe the generosity. Of course I thanked her a million times. And after running to my appointment I returned an hour later and paid. Such a great place with incredible staff! HIGHLY recommend!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 28, 2018~Go here 5 days in a row, order the same drink all 5 days, and all 5 days your drink will be different ... no consistency at all. Vanilla iced coffee with cream, how simple is that right. One day the drink will be almost white cause it's nothing but creamier, the next it wont have any creamer, so on and so on. Aren't they supposed to have a `"standard`" amount of cream when you order cream and not just rush to make a crappy drink... slow down, make my drink right. Maybe 1 day out of the 5 my drink will actually be good... I'll try out the new location on union, maybe they'll know how to measure cream so you get the same drink daily...
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 4, 2009~I usually don't write reviews for huge chains like this, but sometimes you just gotta vent.  Hit the drive-thru on Black Friday with the wife.  I ordered a Venti (large) caramel brulee latte, while she got a Tall (small) Pep Mocha latte.  The total was approximately $8.  I roll up to the window, and hand the cashier a $5 plus a coupon for one free drink.  I'd assume that she'd take off the most expensive one, or at least ask, but no, she didn't ask.  So I was expecting about $1 plus change, and was surprised when the cashier gave me $.18.  I questioned which drink she took off, wondering why the venti wasn't the free drink.  Her rational to me was that 'it wasn't that big of a difference because both drinks are about $4'.  I questioned her, specifically asking her if venti and tall drinks really cost the same.  She insisted that yes they did.  Of course, she proceeded to hand me the receipt, I saw that was false (which I already knew).  Yes, it was only a dollar, but this was a complete and utter customer service failure.  If I had not said anything, I could understand, but I questioned which drink she took off and she either lied to me, or was too incompetent to know the price difference.  Additionally, annoying is that I promptly sent an email to Starbucks customer service and a full week later, I have not received a response.  Zero stars to this location and zero stars for no email response from Starbucks corporate.UPDATE:  I'm upgrading this location to a half of a star.  Starbucks corporate finally contacted me about my letter about 10 days or so after I sent it.  While the email they sent me was apologetic, they did not answer any of my questions about Starbucks policy.  Lame.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Dec 9, 2012~As much as I love Starbucks this location is inconsistent in their customer service. The staff is impatient and often makes us feel as if we are inconveniencing them. We go there often since it is close by and just today encountered another example of this.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Sep 19, 2014~It chaps my hide to see their signs in the coffee 'drop' machines offering varying roasts , only to hear them say `"All we have is Pike Place right now`", well then take the stupid signs down!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 12, 2015~Dont ever go on a sunday walked in 30min before closing time saw the employee kind of pissed off because I walked in, was not greeted and I asked to see if I could buy a bread and I was told they were for tomorrow lol it probably only took them 2 minutes to heat that shit up. That afternoon/sunday staff really needs some work
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Feb 21, 2014~I think two stars might be stretching the reality of the service that takes place at this particular Starbucks. It never ceases to amaze me how Starbucks walks its own customers out for lack of service and care
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 1, 2013~Poop on this place. They are not happy and don't have the Starbuck's service we are use too. I am very disappointed. Also because I only had a fifty the service level sunk even lower as I had to inconvenience them with making change. Amazing as busy as it was there were no $20's in the drawer so I got all $1's and 5's for my $46 plus in change.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Dec 20, 2017~Long time customer but will no longer use this Starbucks. Taking much longer to get my order including during slow times with hardly any business. This week they almost forgot my oatmeal on a pick up order and the blueberries were moldy!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 1, 2018~If I could offer a -1 star for this location specially I'd probably say it still wouldn't justify the service. This is the last time I would ever consider this location. I'm all about having off days but if every time I'm here is an off day some major revaluation needs to be preformed. Today's visit consisted of placing my mobile order and walking in to what seemed to be a silent movie. Not a single barista even acknowledge me of the 6 working. To then finding my mobile order wrong (after I had to ask regarding my order I couldn't locate). If I was a executive at Starbucks I'd be ripping all elements of my brand from this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 26, 2013~DUH!  Starbucks hires only the best!  Always fast, friendly service
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 4, 2016~i used to like Starbucks and get my coffee every morning but the service is terrible speciality on this location!! the barristas are super rude INSIDE AND DRIVE TRU they really need a good manager . i had a few bad experiences that make me decide NOT TO GO BACK to Starbucks tanks to the personal that works in this location. I love DUTCH BROS THEY REALLY APRECIATE THEIR COSTUMERS!!!  AND HAVE VALUES......
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 28, 2015~This location is always packed in the mornings. But they have a drive thru. Their breakfast sandwiches leave much to be desired, but the muffins and coffee cakes are delicious. They are our Sunday treats.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 4, 2015~LACKS of customer service but then again that goes for most of the Starbucks in Arizona now a days.Because of that Starbucks is marking their own grave,because well let's all face it if you haven't heard of Dutch bros and you live in Arizona it basically means you live under a rock don't know about you but next time I want coffee I'll be going to Dutch bros.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Apr 3, 2014~Coffee, coffee, and more coffee.  Gotta have it. Love the people that work at this location, we always banter back and forth like nutballs.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 29, 2014~We frequent this location on the weekends on our way out for the day.  The drive through is usually quick, although there have a handful of times they've messed up our drink order.  On the whole though they do a good job with the drinks, and the food is always fresh.  We've also been in a few times, and the experience is similar.  The staff are friendly, and the place is clean.  It's definitely one of the smaller SB locations.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jul 1, 2016~Worst Starbucks! I always place mobile orders at any Starbucks and i usually walk straight to the pickup counter and the staff always acknowledges me and quickly asks if I'm the mobile order. This Starbucks however ignored me while i stood there and waited for someone to look in my direction. After about 5 min Finally one girl says are you the mobile order? Then she follows it with a very rudely said `"well you don't have to stand there just say something`" as shes making someone else's drink. I didn't appreciate the remark as i am the customer and you should be aware of who is in the waiting area at all times. Not to mention she didn't look at me when she said it she looked at the other customer waiting.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Aug 10, 2011~Another one of my favorite locations. Nice friendly staff, helpful and forgiving if you make a stupid mistake!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 23, 2013~I went here before a movie and got an iced coffee.  I asked if they would honor the refill price if I came back after the movie and was exited when they said yes.  I thought I had a new pre-movie routine since I go to the harkins across the street often.  I went back and was now told I need to pay full price.  The gal I talked to before was no longer working.  They wouldn't honor the refill price when I explained what I was told earlier.  That's horrible customer service!  Won't be coming back!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Sep 3, 2014~I have the same issue with this Starbucks as with a fee others that cannot seem to get a sweet iced coffee with cream right :/ Everything else I've had there is okay.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Mar 22, 2015~There's one drink that this Starbucks makes right, but any other time I come through the drive thru, however, they always seem to mess up any other drink I order. They never put the special things I specifically ask for. I asked, and repeated myself twice, for lemonade in my drink. Yet, oddly enough there was no lemonade in my drink. I've gone back and had them remade and fixed, but I'm so sick of them not being able to read a sticker and follow directions. I would definitely not recommend this Starbucks location, unless you like going back and forth and wasting your time, gas, and breath on something so simple and easy to follow.However, the ladies that are often at the window are very kind. The males however, could careless about what you have to say and they don't really smile or have a personality.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 5, 2015~No no no no no no..........I live near This location and have gone here a lot. 1 out of 10 times they get the order right. Unfortunately other locations are out of my way. I can't wait to move in a month and hopefully find a better location. This one is horrible. They can't even follow the instructions that are laid out for them to make a coffee with the right amount of syrup or sweetener. And ordering a sweetened iced green tea and forgetting to sweeten it is unforgivable. I just don't understand what's wrong with this location. Maybe it's the training or lack thereof. I hope they get better, but I won't ever find out because this is the last time I'll ever go there.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 5, 2015~Terrible customer service ever!!! Not helpful at all.. You can tell the employees hate their job.  I was there for the 3 dlls frappes promo and the barista seemed not to know what I was talking about. I end up paying double and upset because the way I was treated.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 17, 2014~I have had a few drinks that have been made incorrect, and lets not mention the fact that half of their breakfast sandwiches are never available... but today was the last straw...  There employees tonight were beyond loud and obnoxious when a handful of people where trying to drink coffee and work.  New Management needed ASAP.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 19, 2014~They are busy like everyone says, but it's pretty obvious that they try their best and move quickly. Always polite, always accurate!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 21, 2014~awesome store, friendly employees, and a really fast drive thru. my favorite location in the valley!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 21, 2015~I am a daily starbucks drinker and I alwats go.through drive thru. Whenever I go through there, my favorite person who works there is Peter. He's always very helpful and very sweet. He's the only reason I enjoy coming to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 10, 2022~I tried to purchase cups at this Starbucks they had none out so I asked the employee and he said yes they have cups in the back but the manager told him to put those back because those are his.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 27, 2020~The Starbucks girl is so rude, she threw my change on the counter the first time I was there and my matcha latte tasted Iike it was just milk so I was like maybe she had a bad day, I stopped in a week later to grab a coffee and she didn't say one word when I went to the counter as if I was bothering her then I asked if she had a tip jar she ignored me, I got a caramel macchiato which again tasted like milk and there was no caramel. I'm sorry but if I'm going to pay 5-8 for a drink at least make it right. I would highly recommend going to another Starbucks. Horrible.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 20, 2019~Wish i could put ZERO stars. It's not that hard to take an order. I ordered a simple ice tea and the girl guys `"WHAT THE WHAT`" I'm sorry to you need to learn a little bit of customer service. It's fine if you do not know all the teas or specials drinks whatever but a little of customer service is not that hard. Your taking a simple order for goodness sakes.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 9, 2019~Went there for the green tea Matcha frap deal they had today the girl named Ashley told me that I need the app so I told her I'm going to back up out of the drive through and download it I downloaded it and then added my card. I came back ordered it and I asked her a very simple question on if I need to load money onto the card because I didn't know I've never used the app before and then she got mad rolled her eyes at me and told me `"whatever I don't feel like dealing with this`" `"I'll just charge you the same`" with my debit card. When all I asked what a very simple question that would have taking me seconds to put what I needed on there. Instead I got attitude from her cause I guess my time isn't as valuable as hers. Definitely won't ever be back at this location and sucks cause I work right by it
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 20, 2024~I just had the BEST Carmel Ribbon Crunch from Starbucks. It's my favorite and Ashley made it the best hands down!!!! Everything was perfect including her and the service!! ThxExtra drizzle &amp; Crunch
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 25, 2024~great service and understanding staff. Disgruntled costumer being crass and belligerent with manager she kept her cool and offered to remake drink, even when costumer needed a dose of reality.  Good job. I couldn't deal with these Karen's.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 9, 2024~Each Starbucks has their own charm yet consistently good at almost each and every location. This location is clean, friendly and fast!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 10, 2024~I'll never go to this Starbucks again. Luke warm drip coffee and staff with an attitude. I'm over it.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 26, 2024~My GO TO Starbucks!!! Always fast service, great baristas and love the seating inside!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 22, 2023~Terrible customer service! Extremely unhelpful! When you place a mobile order you would expect to be able to pick it up in the store. People place mobile orders because they are in a hurry to get somewhere, usually work, and we don't have time to go through a long line. Well to my surprise the lobby was closed so when a group of customers is waiting at the door they don't want to be told to get back in their cars and wait in line. Especially when we can see the drinks right behind you and you refuse to hand them to your customers! Maybe turn off your mobile ordering!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 31, 2024~oh my goodness, this used to be such a great location and in the last month, it has been horrible. i've come back multiple times to try to give them another chance and i've spent a cumulative time of 1 hr and 36 minutes in this drive through within only 3 visits. the employees give horrible attitude, mess up orders, and make faces at customers through the window if we look impatient. if you have somewhere else to be in a timely manner, do NOT come here. you'll be here all day. so sad to see it in such decline
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 12, 2023~I order a cookies &amp; creams venti they got my order wrong three times!! I spoke up and red it out clear they still had my order wrong.... Still I ended up with horrible drink watery &amp; the cookie crumble floating on top. I hate paying for something that I didn't ask for or can't enjoy.. then they continue to laugh in my face like it was funny... get it together !!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Nov 5, 2022~Check your order before you leave. I waited 10 minutes in the drive-thru despite placing a mobile order.I saw the car in front of me take a baked good and hand it back to the employee, who then apologized. I think the item was incorrect or it was(n't) warmed up.When I got to the window, they tried to hand me a venti iced drink when I ordered a tall hot soy chai. It's concerning the orders were wrong for two cars in a row. My drink tasted fine, but I wondered if they incorrectly made my drink with milk. I can't have dairy, so I guess we'll find out shortly?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jan 14, 2023~Tried a mobile order here. Waited 5 mins before I left home so everything should be ready right? It's a 7-10 min drive. I get there and everything is ready except the veranda coffee which is fine I know they usually don't have it. They told me they just have Pike and I said that's fine just a venti coffee of any type. I see them go over and dump the coffee meaning no one is keeping up on it (they're busy but also have 6-7 baristas and one of their jobs is floater and their #1 priority is to make sure to brew every 10 mins). Then I see them place my cup under one and hit brew which is a 5 minute process.They had plenty of time to anticipate me coming for this coffee and shouldn't have to prepare if they're abiding by Starbucks policy and standards.{I worked at Sky Harbor with 2-3 baristas total and had a better grip on operations just as busy if not more.}I politely mentioned to the barista I would gladly take a venti Americano instead because I'm trying to get back home (I'm not about to wait 5 mins for a mobile order that should be done, basic coffee, and my iced drink is melting). He said `"you just have to wait 30 seconds`" and proceeded to pour coffee into the cup that's only been brewed 1.5 minutes.If you know anything about coffee that's a big no-no. He just forced me to take a half-***ed coffee that's bitter and imbalanced because it's not had time to fully extract and brew properly instead of giving me an alternative that I offered to become a satisfied customer and overcome the issue that was *his* mistake of being behind. {When I was a barista I always offered Americanos as an alternative if I was out of coffee or had any timely issue or didn't have decaf brewed coffee. It's really not a big deal.}He handed me the coffee and told me thank you for your patience and I said thanks. I'm sure he was being sarcastic since I said I was trying to leave. The coffee is bitter.My trainer at Starbucks said brewed coffee is the namesake of any coffee shop and should always be something you're good on as such. Maybe they should review the basics of coffee at this location or train their baristas to offer alternatives if they've messed up or if they are out of something, it is the absolute best way to earn back someone's business who received less-than standard service. Literally every other Starbucks goes by this principle. `"Let us make this right for you.`" Not `"drink this bitter *** coffee.`" Lmao.Once again this location is lackluster service even with new baristas there.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Feb 13, 2022~The drinks are usually made right. I'm just making this review because the store is usually not too busy inside, and yet I never seem to be greeted or welcomed between at least 6 employees working behind the counter. I worked at Starbucks for a year in 2010 (the good ol' days) and I would never ignore a customer. I had a great time every day I worked there because it's a fun job! People are excited to go there! The occasional Karen complaining about their drink is just another challenge to make their drink better, they will praise you if you redeem the situation right with respect and patience.Even when I went up to the cashier they just stared at me silently until I ordered, and this is the kind of vibe that seems to be the norm at all locations now. They weren't rude but everyone's just silent and lifeless the whole time. Why can't anyone just be human and say hello to their customers and ask them how their day is going? Is everyone so woke that they're just always grumpy in defense mode waiting to be offended even at a service job that's supposed to be fun and upbeat? One of the baristas was literally just standing around in the middle the entire time I was in the store. Just dancing around and chatting other baristas up, but no one ever looks beyond their work station or the counter. I give people the benefit of the doubt and I'm always willing to forgive which is why I'm still giving 3 stars and won't tell you not to go here but Starbucks has just not been the same awesome place I remember in the last 2 years at any location I've been to. It's always this awkward experience where I feel unwelcome or non existent to the employees who just look uninspired and like they just rolled out of bed and put a green apron on. Black rock coffee and local places put them to shame when compared side-by-side. Shoot even making a cup at home seems more worth it. I only go here for a treat for my girl or my kiddos, not for me.A smile would be nice, a warm greeting would be progress, and some semblance of humanity would help justify the purpose of leaving my house to get pricey drinks.Not saying this because I think I'm so important that I need constant acknowledgement, just saying this as a spectator of coming to Starbucks randomly the last 2 years and being generally unimpressed by the service and just not understanding why it's so difficult to be nice to people. In my time at Starbucks I borrowed at at least 10 different locations around the Valley and they were pretty consistent in being awesome in service and quality and personality. I wouldn't say don't come here because I'll still go here for fun sometimes but I just hope they work on their people skills for their own sakes and life paths. There's no reason to be short with others unless they're being rude or unreasonable about their drink etc. There's no reason to get so bitter in life that you can't try to make someone else's day and become so self-absorbed you can't see past your own nose. It's a bad look for Starbucks and honestly makes me kind of sad to think of this as the new generation of adults. I hope I'm wrong.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jun 19, 2022~The vanilla sweet cream cold brew needed more cream at this location. Short line on an early midday Sunday afternoon.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Dec 28, 2022~The staff here is great and the location is really nice! I come almost every day. However, I'd say about 70% of the time they're out of at least one thing we're trying to order. The breakfast sandwiches, lemon loafs, peppermint syrup, stoppers, sleeves, etc. We're un-phased by it now so we come with back up plans for our coffee/breakfast order. Not a great stop if you're particular about your coffee routine
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 3, 2022~This Starbucks USED TO BE a very good location. I don't know hat has happened. But now drinks are constantly messed up. And by the worst on 03/31/2022 again. Drink messed up. Easy to make. Not horribly complicated. But just to add extra shots of espresso into a drink seems like a BIG DEAL and a hassle for closers. Which I don't understand why. I took one sip.  Couldn't taste the added triple shot. Barista Annie did offer to remake.  But it took  her 10 MINUTES all because she was talking crap so much about the drink so loudly. I can hear it from the booth right by the entrance door while she's there behind the barista bar. Unprofessional. Very unhappy. No one seems to give a crap about keeping customers. Cuz the other worker she was talking to was in the lobby gossiping back to her. I work for Dunkin' in Scottsdale and our store has way more professionalism than this! If you feel the need to go gossip and talk crap. Do it on your phone with a text or do it behind in the kitchen where no one can hear you instead absolutely unacceptable and will not tolerate being treated like such shit just from a location that's convenient to home.   And please quit randomly closing early. We're understaffed too but we still stay open FULL HOURS drive thru, lobby and all
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 24, 2022~I went to this Starbucks this morning in the drive thru. I ordered a black cold brew which was bitter as hell. Tried the back sausage wrap and it was cold in the middle. My wife did like her Chai latte and sandwich.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 11, 2023~My mom and I were at starbucks this morning and the emplo Bea was super sweet!!! He was very respectful and nice. Wonderful person!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 5, 2021~Best Starbucks in the state! Coffee is always made right and every staff member is delightful, helpful, friendly, and kind! Way to go this particular Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 17, 2022~It's staring to become inconsistent again and it's getting old to tell you the truth. I love Starbucks and being able to enjoy a cup of coffee especially when it's walking distance from me. However it's getting to the point where staff has said `"we are out of the strawberries for the açaí refresher.`" Which I was ok with not getting. What did I get instead, a hibiscus tea that clearly had no strawberry syrup I wish there was more transparency but this location is constantly out of so many things but when you drive down the road to another Starbucks location they seem to never be out of anything. It's just getting a bit frustrating.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 13, 2019~Thought I would mention this location is improving. The drinks are better to taste now and the drive thru line doesn't take a long time to get through. Keep up the great work. Update 6-13-19 Wow are the drinks amazing now. They are made just perfect! Awesome improvement here. Can't wait to keep coming by and it's walking distance from my place no more driving to the other locations ! Yay !!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 27, 2018~Thought I would mention this location is improving. The drinks are better to taste now and the drive thru line doesn't take a long time to get through. Keep up the great work!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Nov 4, 2018~The drinks are not made like they normally are at other Starbucks location. I feel like the staff really needs to be trained on their drink making. The drive thru line always takes a long time. You need a good 15 solid minutes before you even leave the line. I hope this improves although it's such a convenient location I have been driving further out to another location because the quality of the drink taste a lot better.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 27, 2018~I am so happy this opened right where I live now I don't have to travel as far to get coffee and it's across the street from Paradise Valley Community College ! How convenient !!! The staff here is well trained and really knows how to operate. The service is quick and speedy. My coffee is made just like it always is. Not every location gets it right but I'm happy they do. This is going to be my new starbucks location I come to.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 14, 2022~Not impressed, just curious how much does Starbucks charge for a refill on a standard cup of coffee grande?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 31, 2023~Service has improved dramatically! Now, enthusiastic and friendly staff delivering quality products.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 20, 2022~Yesterday (Oct. 19 @5pm) was the first time I received great customer service from this location. Amazing employees they were so nice! The girl cashier inside kept a smile and was happy to take our order. I wanted to get their names so they can get recognition but they were quick on getting other orders out so I didn't want to distract them. I know that the girl had long pretty lashes and two other guys. Thank you, I really appreciate you guys!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 12, 2019~New Starbucks! Yes! Plus this location is on the corner and has a drive thru! Bonus points!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 8, 2022~Horrible. Never coming here again! Every time time I come to this Starbucks they never mix my coffee and only add a splash of creamer as well as overfill the cup. I always have to come back so I can get more creamer and a straw to mix my coffee. No matter what I get. The frappes are tasteless and bland. It's unbelievable. This Coffee tastes nasty btw.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Nov 26, 2018~Nice new location right across the street from PVCC! Spacious seating area, but could use more tables with charging ports vs the cute seating arrangements they have now since it's being used by quite a bit of students and others with PCs and tablets, working. Love the decor though,  the service was friendly and fast, and both my tea and coffee were done just right
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 19, 2022~The baristas here are pleasant and efficient. It's a hard job and I appreciate them. Order here at least twice a week and the experience has been consistently great. Thanks!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 23, 2023~This Starbucks &amp; employees are wonderful. I came in today while having a pretty bad day. The barista told me they were out of the sandwich I wanted (not their fault), and I just started crying in front of her. She was so sweet and even gave me a hug. I was so embarrassed because I was just having a bad day, but she was so kind to me about it and I really appreciated it. 10/10
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 15, 2019~Stopped by this Starbucks to give it a try. The Pikes Coffee is the same as every where else. Newer store and larger than my usual hang out. This location has a couple of spots that have living room seating.  Service was good. Car wash located next door but not really a nuisance if sitting outside. No shade for those sunny afternoons and did not see a bike rack. Nice place to try out.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 11, 2020~This location is the worst! Sadly! I'm a Starbucks addict and this place can't get it together!!! I go to this location because it is the only one closest to my house. Every time I go they get my drink wrong. Today I spent $25 in Starbucks purchases and wasn't even offered a free Starbucks air freshener!!! I seriously hope this location can get its act together it is so maddening!! If you can avoid this location and go to another Starbucks I would highly recommend it! Sincerely, The biggest Karen of them all (don't care)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 1, 2019~Puppy Love! Come feel the love. This place is perfect every time. You can choose inside, outside or drive-thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 13, 2022~My daughter and I love this Starbucks. It's our neighborhood store. The staff is always friendly. Also, shoutout to Nanette who always makes us feel welcome. She is a joy to talk to. Enjoy! :))
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 18, 2019~I have been coming here for over a year now and I can honestly say that I haven't had a bad experience yet! (And trust me, I come here A LOT) I often use their mobile order pickup service and they have never taken more than 4-5 min from me ordering. I finally decided to write a review because I want to acknowledge how great management is. I come for the teas and occasional holiday drinks. During this time SO MANY people order the medicine ball (definitely recommend btw for tea lovers), but this means that they are consistently out of Jade Citrus Mint Tea by 1 PM. When I asked for a Jade Citrus Mint Tea today, they were out of course at 4 PM, and the manager could tell I was bummed but not totally upset. She suggested one of her favorite combinations and even offered it on the house since they're always out of the JCMT! Also super awesome of them: I have a holiday reusable cup and she was so great to put a sleeve because for those who have them can vouch for me when I say are thin and too hot to hold without one! I've been to all 5 other starbucks that are within a mile radius of this one and I always come to this one. Has the most seating compared to the others, too (except for Tatum and Bell, I think their the same).
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 13, 2019~Best Starbucks I've been to by far when it comes to customer service. Staff is extra friendly here and I've been here maybe 3-4 times and they've memorized my order! How cool! Not as much tables here as others I've been to (which is what I need for school work) but plenty of chairs for relaxed mingling or reading. I've witnessed them handle some tough customers before and they always handle it so well.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 18, 2019~This is right around the corner from the abode so it's beyond convenient. I like that's it's a larger store; good place to study, socialize etc. We've been here several time already and the staff is very prompt, friendly and all you expect from Starbucks.Only drawback it had a tiny parking lot and it will be eventually shared with another store so that might make things interesting. It does have a drive thru as well.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Mar 24, 2023~drinks are fine, but i get like 2 sips of it. calm down with ice jesus christ.  make the drinks how you would want it yourself, it's not hard
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 18, 2020~Absolutely terrible service. I've been to this location 3 times, all for drive through. They messed up my order 2 times. First time I ordered the iced guava passion fruit iced drink with light ice. The drink they gave me almost had a cup full of ice in it. When I pointed this out they removed the ice, refilled some juice, and added some syrup. The drink basically ended up being gross and undrinkable. The second time was earlier this morning when I ordered a decaf pike and iced black tea lemonade. They gave me a machicato and black iced tea. I again pointed this out and they did give me a decaf plwhich I asked for but for the iced black tea lemonade they simply gave me a cup with only lemonade in it, did you expect me to mix the drink myself?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 24, 2020~The young kids holding down the fort here are doing their best. However, I think the drive thru only environment is getting to them. I ordered the same drink I usually order and their response was `"ok but it usually comes hot so it'll take us longer to make it iced.`" And I was confused so I said `"what?`" And they were like `"It's just going to take longer to make.`" Maybe it's just me, but it really felt like they didn't want to make my really simple iced tea drink. So I, in shock, said `"ok, thats all. Thank you`" and pulled forward. When I got to the window I immediately apologized and explained that I didn't know what to say because of course iced tea takes longer than hot tea... They didn't say `"oh its ok`" or `"no problem.`" Nope.  They proceeded to tell me they can't make the drink in a Trenta. Even though I always get it that way. Just... bizarre. They ended up giving me my stuff for free even though I insisted I wanted to pay. *sigh* Honestly, I think these kids just need some time at the beach or at the park with friends or something. I only felt compelled to write this as a way to process my absolute shock (I still felt like they just did NOT want to make my drink), and because if you are looking for a high level of service right now - this just ain't it, sis. With fewer options for starbucks right now, I'm going to give this Starbucks a break and go out of my way. I hope it gets better once we can all go in the store again.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 7, 2022~Very rude management I ordered an iced coffee there was I waited for 20 mins the people behind me got there order I ask about mine and she snapped I got my money back and the tip a went to black rock.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Oct 21, 2019~Came here at 8 PM there was nobody in the drive thru and it took them 9 minutes to get my order and give me my drink add on an extra 3 minutes because the guy couldn't understand me after repeating myself saying `"reload my starbucks card first and then charge my drink on my starbucks card..`" he charged my debit card with the drink and reload which would make me miss out on my points. I made him redo the whole transaction which was a waste of time. On the bright side when I said extra salted sweet cream cold foam they did put it unlike some other locations that barely put any extra. The drink didn't taste like it had 8 pumps of caramel syrup like I had asked, being an ex starbucks employee I can tell if a drink is made right or not.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Nov 29, 2019~It's a nice location with friendly staff but the internet upload speeds are among the slowest I've ever found in a Starbucks. If you are looking for a great drink, come here. If you are looking for a great drink while uploading a Youtube Video...go somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Sep 7, 2019~This location is convient for me and Ive never had an issue which is why they get 3 stars. Now I understand there needs to be room for foam but if Im paying $6 for a coffee and before I even take a sip its like an inch or two down from the rim thats just super dissapointing. I feel like I just wasted my money since half the coffee I paid for isnt even in the cup.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Mar 26, 2020~Was 10 cars deep in the drive-through to get my unsweetened green tea only to get home and discovered it had seven pumps of sugar in it and tasted nasty. There was probably another dozen cars behind me in line so not going through that again to get it fixed so just dumped 3.50 down the drain! My bad I didnt check before pulling out but didnt want to delay the line. How hard is unsweetened green tea?
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 1, 2020~I come here all the time for a cold brew and bacon sandwich and it never disappoints! Easily the best Starbucks in the Northern Phoenix/Cave Creek Area! Stay safe everyone
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 6, 2019~I watched your barista make my frapp using a dirty blender.  My frapp tasted like milk! If youre going to charge someone $5.70 for coffee, make sure it has coffee!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 2, 2021~This is my go-to location on my way to work! The service is always fast and the employees are always nice, Miguel is awesome and provides superb customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 14, 2018~I have no idea what the other 2 reviews are complaining about..I have been here everyday since they opened and sometimes twice a day...Great Staff , Great Service and I must say an Awesome Atmosphere...Tammy the MGR is a wonderful person along with her outstanding staff , Greg, Kyle, Erica, Sam, Bethany, Shanika. A very friendly, welcoming place. If you are particular on the way you want your drink made, you will not get an attitude here.They will make it exactly the way you want it!! Keep up the Great work...Thanks Michael
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 3, 2019~Drove through Starbucks to grab some coffee drinks for my son &amp; I &amp; to my delight they said they were on the house because of the hold up... I didn't notice that much of a wait but what a nice surprise...thanks guys !!!  See you soon...
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 29, 2019~The staff is always so cool and friendly, and the green tea frappes are the best!! Next I think I am going to try the snicker doodle!!! The guy made it sound Soo wonderful
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jan 1, 2019~Love this location. Easy to get in to and usually tables to sit and enjoy coffee. Friendly employees!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Apr 8, 2020~Love this location! Always great products! The staff is so friendly and always kind. My kids love coming here and the staff make them feel valued!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 21, 2018~Come here early mornings before work.  The staff is amazing always super friendly.  And my drinks are always made perfect!   So glad this location was built because it's just down the street from me!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 6, 2021~The people are always very nice. They greet me by name every time, and immediately give me my order. Their greetings do not sound robotic or fake, they seem to genuinely love to serve their guests. I've only had a few very minor concerns, and each time I express them, they compensate me even if I'm just voicing my concern not looking for extras. Sometimes, I've even wrongly advised that the wrong drink was given to me, not realizing that the online order I selected was the wrong size, and they still give me the size I originally intended instead of what was ordered without arguing it.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 2, 2020~Nan in the drive thru window brightened my entire morning!! She was such a sweet genuine lady! I'll be back! Ps. My drink was perfect too! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jun 23, 2019~Ordered an americano in my personal mug. They asked if I wanted room. I said yes. Drink was delivered with coffee to the rim, no room. I asked them to dump some out. They did n it ran down my mug. They handed it back. I asked for a napkin to clean my mug. They complied. The drink wasn't  hot. Lack of quality.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 26, 2019~This location does not seem to represent the Starbucks model of providing customer care. I came into the store at 8:54pm; a few minutes before the store closed for the night. The manager gave me a frozen loaf of bread and was unable to heat it up. The manager kicked me out of the store and I was unable to get a refund. I will definitely never return to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 28, 2019~Great location. Very spacious store with updated tables with the USB chargers. They are one of the few in the area open until 9:30pm, which is great. Drinks and service are what you'd expect from the Starbucks brand.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Oct 14, 2019~To my surprise, they got my order right which is always a plus. The people were very rude, however, and, a pet peeve of mine, never tell me what my total is before I pay. This location has yet to tell me my total prior to paying and I've been coming here for two years just thinking `"maybe today is the day`" but it never is. It baffles me that some of these people still have a job.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~3~Dec 11, 2024~there are some nice baristas but also some very rude ones. most of the time they don't bother to make your drink correctly for whatever reason..
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Mar 4, 2024~The first thing I noticed when walking in on a Saturday afternoon was that the floors were quite dirty. I was the only one in the restaurant ordering at the time so I was confused why someone wasn't out cleaning tables and all the other mess. Starbucks stocks one of my favorite cold pressed brands called Evo. At this establishment, there was only two flavors; you can find better variety at other Starbucks. They did have Koia smoothie though which I haven't seen at other Starbucks. In addition to the protein smoothie, two Evo juices, I got a venti (that's their largest size) matcha creme frappacucino and a double bacon and egg sandwich. The breakfast sandwich cost more than an In N Out burger and was smaller than one too. The matcha frapp was delicious though. The whole order came out to $28.72.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Aug 29, 2024~Horrific service in their lobby. Waited for 25 minutes for 10 people to make a quad espresso.  When I went up and asked where it was, they said they put lobby customers drinks in a different place and it was sitting there the whole time.  As I'm standing where everyone is picking up their drinks the whole time.  Black Rock coffee is better anyway.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~4~Aug 14, 2024~I love this Starbucks, I like that it's close to my house and they have good seating. Sometimes the music is too loud and sometimes they randomly shut down the lobby which is annoying. Everyone here is really nice.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Oct 1, 2024~There's one employee at this location who is always rude. I frequent many Starbucks locations, but will never visit this one again.  Drive farther to one without this rude employee. I'm accustomed to good customer service at Starbucks, but because of one employee, this location fails.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Sep 16, 2023~I will never go back to this Starbucks until they get better management. The manager is so arrogant and rude literally over any simple modifications to a drink. For example. I ordered a Venti iced chai with oat milk and pumpkin sauce in a Trenta cup. She literally flipped out on me. Told me that's not part of their standards at Starbucks and they're not allowed to do that. How that goes against their policies. I said to her. Charge me for a cup.  Or charge me for extra oat milk. I said to her. I've never ever ran into this problem at any Starbucks stand alone or even ones in the grocery store and started naming off all the other locations that I've been to that have done it for me. She proceeded to argue me that I had to pay for venti and etc. I asked for Trenta ice cup on side. She told me I was harassing her. I said to her. I'm a paying customer and how am I harassing her when she's the one starting shit with me. I said to her. Maybe some professionalism would help her out some. I said to her. No customer should have to experience this especially over something like a venti drink in a Trenta.  So to top it all off. I'm waiting for my drink for almost 10 minutes. I asked about it. She said she cancelled it. Like wtf??
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Jan 31, 2024~Stepping into this coffee haven feels like a warm embrace for your senses. From the rich aromas to the expertly crafted brews, every cup tells a story of passion and dedication. A must-visit for anyone seeking a truly elevated coffee experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Nov 19, 2023~Wanted to get the holiday red cup they had and asked if they they had anything sugar free so I could get the cup, I can't have any sugar and I explained that to them so what could they make for me, the girl said nothing! So then she ask the manager and the manager said can't make anything, So I ask can I any other drink to get the red cup and they said No goodbye, so I went to Dutch Brothers  and enjoyed the way treat customers
Phoenix, AZ 85020~3~Mar 7, 2021~SB on a slightly sketchy street. I had a psycho walking by threaten me and several strung out acting people were wandering around. I had to call security from the shopping center who did a good job deterring the wannabe robber.The SB is smaller than avg with small seating area. They lose a star for not allowing customers to sit down even outside which other Starbucks are allowing.Below avg. Starbucks, not recommended.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Feb 7, 2023~Love this location &amp; others. The staff is great,Bryce one of the mgrs,Keiko,Andy and everyone are awesome.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Dec 8, 2022~My favorite Starbucks &amp; staff. They do great drinks.they go out of their way for me &amp; treat me great
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~May 29, 2022~This is one of my favorite Starbucks in Sunnyslope,close to my favorite Honor Health formerly (John C Lincoln hospital) close to all medical. You will see medical staff in this Starbucks,they are great
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Jun 13, 2023~I just want to give a BIG and SINCERE shout out to this Starbucks. They were very fast, efficient, friendly, and most importantly....accurate. I've been a loyal customer for years now. I've been to Starbucks all across the country and this the best tasting Strawberry Acai that I've ever tasted. Thank you Adam (the barrister) and the beautiful young lady (Miss Ponytail) who took my order. Whenever I'm nearby, I'll be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Mar 6, 2024~Dunlap and 1st st store-  12:15 on 3/5/24: both coffees were missing requested cream, food was mediocre and not worth the inflated prices. Drive-thru Batista was not friendly. Today, I decided to go to a different Starbucks in future if at all.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Aug 28, 2023~5 star is for Michelle. She is literally the absolute best Starbucks employee I have ever had any interaction with. She is so SWEET!! Anytime I ever go in it's PACKED, especially when school is in session. You got teachers, you got students, then you got your usual AM crowd. She literally remains polite, calm &amp; as fast as she can go. I always know my drink is good when she works. If there ever was a mess up she's never made me feel like I'm bothering her which in the past at the location this has happened if I asked for a remake /: but not with her. Another thing that I want to mention is both her and Stephanie always say MY NAME as soon as I walk in. Hello Serena!!! Like HEYYYY. They actual care about my name. Keep up the great work. Best Starbucks &amp; Barista of the year !!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Jan 9, 2024~Such nice workers! I loved Jeremy, he personally made my night and went out of his way to be so kind to me. I had been working on homework for an hourish and he had offered me water as well. Overall, great staff experience and very clean store.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Jun 1, 2022~One of the worst Starbucks locations I have ever visited! They are unable to make drinks on their menu, and somehow they have figured out how to rush you on the speaker...but keep you waiting in line forever.One particular visit here, I ordered a drink and as usual they messed it up...it was the most watered down frappe I have ever seen. Anyhow I called in to advise the manager, and she stated I could return later to have it remade. I returned, and when they remade the drink, they had me park out front until they brought it. They brought my drink, and they put the top in loose so it could fall all over my clothes. This drink was also very watered down. That was last time I would ever visit this location.If anyone cares to read this, these people are evil! They're rude, and they talk to customers however they wish. I don't believe they are reprimanded or trained. Instead of stopping at this location (which is 5 minutes away from my home) I drive up to Greenway rd near 7th street. It's worth the drive, to meet nice folks. I truly would love to see this location shut down for good. There is nothing but bad energy and drinks here.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Dec 4, 2023~I would like to say they are the most disrespectful and condescending people I have ever met!  I went inside and ordered my drinks and asked to use the restroom.  Which after a long talk with the guy about my change, I was already pissed off at him.  Then he said I would have to leave my purse at the front counter!!  I'm a 43 year old woman and I don't need to leave my purse anywhere!!  Needless to say I just got my drinks and left...went to Walmart and used their restroom.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Jun 21, 2019~Now Open Starbucks across from the Hospital- I'm sure I'm not the only one who is tired, thirsty or mentally drained when dealing with the worry of family health concerns right!? Well Starbucks is now open across the street from John C Lincoln Hospital and I'm sure this was long overdue for the early mornings and late nights. The staff was extra friendly, the location was convenient, and the staff was cleaning while I was here.Extra shout out to the staff member who showed me sneak peak to Starbucks Tumblers that are coming out next week so I can get excited to use my Starbucks rewards points! Following you on Instagram already!My experience was perfect!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Aug 19, 2023~Poor service. Went on Saturday 8/19 about 2:45 PM; it was not a busy time as only one car was ahead of us in the drive thru. I ordered a venti pineapple passion fruit lemonade (the frozen drink featured on their menu). It came back iced but not blended. Then, when we asked for it to be made frozen again like on the menu, the girl was annoyed and we were told we ordered it wrong. When the barista remade it, she just put it back in the blender with a bit of ice.  I ended up with a watery `"frozen`" lemonade. I go to other locations in the valley regularly and they've always made this drink well. I ended up going to the Starbucks on W Northern Ave to order it again -- they apologized and even offered to comp the drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Feb 23, 2023~Check your drinks if you are using the drive through, half the time they aren't correct. I always order the same drink - a grande quad cappuccino - and I receive that order correctly maybe half the time. Paying $6+ dollars for a drink, it should be right! Unfortunately I don't have time to travel to a different location so I try not to come very often, so anyone else who visits this location just double check your order.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Jul 24, 2021~Too bad.Since my last review this Starbucks staff and service has gone downhill. The decline was slow and steady but I stuck with it for a while. All culminated with an exaggerated eye roll when I asked for a receipt. Pathetic behavior for any service job to be honest.Big shout out to the old crew here. The management and employees did a great job back then.I won't be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~May 21, 2020~Way better than the average Starbucks. This is by far the best Starbucks I have ever been to. I have been going here for almost 3 years and they absolutely kill it. Wait times are short, almost all staff if friendly, they remember your drinks after a while, and coffee tastes great. Shout out to the employees and especially the managers. Top down effect is working great and a little culture has brewed.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Apr 23, 2022~I always go to this Starbucks however I am so frustrated with the management how how they are handling problems. While going through the drive through around two weeks ago I was never handed my card back. I canceled the card just in case and received a new card two weeks later. The day after getting my new card I go the same Starbucks and the SAME thing happens. I go to run errands and don't have my card again. I know I should be double checking to make sure I have my card but for them to also forget to give it back and say I am go to go is frustrating. When I went to get my second card back I mentioned that this is the second time that this has happened and I got a response `"okay and what do you want us to do about it`". I understand they are busy and are used to scanning phones but still I felt like they could care less.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Nov 30, 2022~Every time I order a drink in the afternoon/evening the staff are super rude or oblivious to guests. Yesterday I had a barista upset because I asked for a straw  lol Morning staff are a bit better- at least they smile and say hi instead of glaring at you or flat out ignoring you lol
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Jun 21, 2022~This place delivers the worst customer service of any Starbucks I have ever visited.  If there is a home of daemons and evil, this geographic location is it.Management cannot hold onto a stable set of workers, and the employees are MEAN, SLOW, and deliver terrible service.  I truly think if there is hub of evil in Sunnyslope, it's at this Starbuck's location - because every time I go there, bad stuff is happening.  The other day, 3 cops were called there.  And as a customer, I can tell you that the employees do nothing to appease the customers as they have been extremely rude and passive-aggressive to me - and I ain't no Karen.  I just go with the flow, get my coffee, and if they're mean, I just ignore them and drive away.   Even watching cars ahead of me, I have seen customers (who just want their coffee!) get upset with jerkweed employees.I told one of the managers (who has always been outstanding to interact with, forgot her name), and she acknowledged that it was a total S**T show working there.  To potential customers, go to another branch as this branch is full of mean girls, jerks, and negative energy, and they will ruin your day.To the employees, stop taking our your mental aggressions/disease on the innocent customers.  Most customers just want their coffee - there is NO reason to be rude and passive aggressive with the good ones.  I understand there are bad customers, but just because they are mean to you doesn't give you the right to take it out on the next person in line!  If you can't handle working in customer service, then quit and do something else.    You shoot yourself in the foot and just pay forward negative energy.  I hope Starbucks corporate closes this location - it's evil incarnate.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Jun 5, 2021~I come to buy every day and the lobby it's close every day before 11 AM it's a problem Because it's always a big line on the drive-through I think this is a problem please fix
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Sep 23, 2020~Staff super nice. Someone usually says welcome to Starbucks. Drive Thru very busy. Clean store. Ppl sitting inside do take off their masks. Not ok.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~3~Jul 14, 2021~Felt compelled to write an update after several recent visits (it's close to my doctor's office) and their customer service has improved. No, I do not challenge them with complex orders but if I keep it simple, it's usually A-OK. The mid-pandemic pick-up would change every time I returned, sometimes the front door would be open, sometimes you could only access the side doors, but there was always signage to reflect the change.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Oct 1, 2019~You may want to avoid this location altogether. At the drive thru window, I've been told to wait in the parking lot for nitro cold brews that never materialized (I called the store and reminded them they sent me there 15 minutes prior and they literally had no idea what I was talking about BECAUSE, WAIT, WHAT STARBUCKS HAS EVER DONE THAT, IT ISN'T A MCDONALDS); today I placed an in-app order where the male barista not only gets my order completely wrong (green tea instead of black) but then HIDES the drink behind the otherwise empty pick-up stand while I wait patiently for my name to be called. Who does that? It's been way too long for them to get a `"it's a new store`" pass, this is habitual and a reflection of poor managerial oversight. The Sunnyslope Starbucks motto should be `"baristas who have absolutely no training, blank stares and a genuine hatred for humanity`".
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Apr 25, 2021~THIS IS THE SECOND TIME! It's 7:45pm and this location is closed. The hours online reflect a 9pm closing time. So annoying to pull up and see cones in the drive thru!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Oct 7, 2019~So everyone was nice. They apologized that it took longer than it should have for my drink. I'm a at least a once a day girl. Was in the neighborhood and need a coffee. Mobile ordered while I was at the light at 7th St. Pull in and walk inside. Hadn't even started my drink. Male barista asks my name. He says I'm working on it. He pours my cold brew and adds the cream then proceeds to ask a female to finish for him. Again she was nice BUT she proceeds to put ice in my drink and put a lid on it and hand it to me. I'm like this was supposed to have cold foam...it was? Did you read the label? Trenta Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, extra ice. So male turns and says `"did you want extra foam?`" No. I wanted extra ice. Female dumps part of my drink out and gives me what little cold foam that is left in the blender. We are out of pumpkin cold foam now. Oy vey. Please just read the label when you make my drink. It's in black and white. It really irks me when I pay $6 for a coffee and it's not perfect. Two stars. One for each of the baristas. They were nice but nice doesn't always cut it.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~May 31, 2022~This is my favourite Starbucks.  They make my drinks best and I never have to wait very long.  The drive-through  layout here can be a bit of a cluster because of the parking lot for the strip mall  but their drive through lines are shorter than most others and the employees are always friendly.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Nov 17, 2022~Mixed feelings about this Starbucks; I normally come In the morning and have fantastic service; but when I come after 12 noon seems like everyone is in a bad mood and dread work which make my experience unpleasant; they will also let you stand in line  for a long time till you actually have to ask for assistance.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~3~Feb 9, 2019~Been here a few times. Not bad. Today we were disappointed in the dollop of whip cream on our drinks. We asked for more when the girl at the window turned around to tell the other barista our request, the look on her face wasn't happy. FYI..be mindful of your facial expressions when customers are watching. After paying over $13 for 2 drinks I don't think it should be a crime to ask for the whip cream serving that should come on top. So she returned with the drinks and they added another shot of it on one side of the dome of the cup. Guess asking for it to be topped off correctly wasn't what they wanted to do. Disappointing especially when this is a new Starbucks and you are so close. I'm ok with driving to Dutch Bros and getting what I ask for with a pleasant response too, oh and it's cheaper!! Do better Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Aug 17, 2019~Brendan took my order and was perfect! Dude had good vibes and made my drink phenomenal! Extremely happy and just when I needed getting off work!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Sep 17, 2022~Never in my life, have I come across a drive-through experience in which I was so thoroughly changed. 15 minutes before the close of my green and white mermaid lover, Two friends and I embarked on a journey to spend a collection of tattered birthday gift cards. For years, money has been piling up in the bottom of my sock drawer in the form of $5 gift cards. Whether a generous thank-you gift or a stingy birthday present, I've acquired at least 5 plastic seasonal masterpieces every year. After 13 years of saving, I finally had enough to treat my friends and me to a cup of whatever they wanted, and nothing sounded better than a well-made cup of chocolate milk. Upon driving to the Starbucks, the mood was high as our bodies twitched and scratched in anticipation of the sweet bump. 10 minutes till close, and we were pulling into the drive-through, our jaws now cramping as they clenched imaginary straws between them. With no line ahead of us, we proceeded directly to the talking box and rolled our window down, waiting for the mystery barista's voice. Up next came something we never could have expected. The silence was suddenly broken sirens song filled with a spew of poems, sonnets, limericks, haikus, and versets. My palms began to sweat and my body forgot to breathe as rhymes and rhythms were thrown at us each one hitting my ears so hard they seemed to push me deeper into my car seat. Only when our bodies quivered with the pleasure of such beauty did the words of wisdom finally cease. A moment of silence as the words passed from our memories leaving only a dopamine-drenched euphoric high. Then the cheer began, three stunning chocolate milk cravings, fools began to lift up a grateful noise unto the mystery Starbucks barista. Between our laying down of burnt offerings and cries of joy, somehow, our order was recorded and read back to us. Then words were spoken that redefined anticipation `"I'll see you at the pickup window`". My cramping calves and flexed toes would not accelerate to the pickup window for fear of being unworthy to meet the barista with the tongue of a god. Finally, after an intense session of Chong Ran to become the master of my body, I toed the gas pedal and made it to the window. Standing there, in all of his glory, was Eli. The barista of legend, the man who had changed everything with a minute of words. Pleasantries were exchanged, money was given for milk and we drove off. Silence hung heavy over our car as my companions and I pondered how different our lives would now look after being served in the most supreme fashion. The words spoken that night will never be repeated for the sole reason that their power was too epic to be welded by any one man. Any one man besides our Eli the great and powerful barista. Thank you for your service
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Aug 8, 2019~I love Starbucks.  I go at least once on most days.  There is one in South Phoenix that I frequent.  I stop at another on Roosevelt fairly frequently.  During summer and on weekends I stop at one on 7th and Osborne, or 7th st and McDowell... then there are near Bell and 7th street that I also frequent.  Now there is this new one, and it is so comparatively bad that I can't help but wonder why.I like the consistency from one to another.  I know that the items will be the same, whether I go to one Starbucks or another.  This is completely untrue for the Starbucks at 221 E Dunlap.  The first time I was there, they completely botched my order.  I tried to chalk it up to the store being new, and not running as well because it was new.  After a few weeks, I realized that my imagined problem had nothing to do with their ineptitude.  Every time I would order at that store, something would be incorrectly done or just weird. I would order whip and they would leave it off, I would leave the whip off, and they would add it.  I would get things that I did not order added to my beverage like cinnamon or colored sugars or drizzles that I did not ask for.  I started purchasing using my app so that they couldn't say that they didn't know I wanted this or that.  They would still make alterations in mu order that I did not request.  I would order an espresso frappuccino with sugarfree cinnamon syrup.  They would add the cinnamon, but leave out all the coffee.  Today I ordered a strawberry frappuccino which is normally made with whole milk.  Today, mine was made with nonfat milk. The barista also used a straw that was 3 inches shorter than my beverage.At most Starbucks, I count on about 3-5 minutes per car of wait time.  At 221 E Dunlap, I know the wait will be double or even triple.  There were cars behind me honking after 10 min.I also count on Starbucks to have a clean bathroom.  This is the only one in town that I have seen that still uses single-gender bathrooms.  This is also the only one that has offered no solution for customers when their ladies room is out of order. ​I have three university degrees and am 3 classes short of a Ph.D., yet their very young male employees still try to mansplain to me why the beverage with whip that I ordered is correct without the whip.  I think I'll stick with one [any] of the other Starbucks in my path.  I just don't know what else to say.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Mar 8, 2020~This is the worst Starbucks drive thru I've ever been to! I've literally been waiting over 15min for a venti drink.  Do not go to this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Mar 21, 2020~Starbucks!!? Why are your employees NOT wearing gloves? I was just passed a drink through the drive thru her hand was on the lid. Let's say I just wasted 7$ there's a virus out there! Glove up and don't touch where people's mouths go no matter what!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~May 23, 2019~Not a fan of this location. I was looking forward to a Starbucks in Sunnyslope but this new store  has left much to be desired. It feels like most times I come here the drinks are mediocre and the baristas aren't very friendly or they have very dry personalities. I do my best to just skip this specific location altogether.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Sep 11, 2022~The worst customer service, i ordered on my app arrived a few minutes after my pickup time. Due to today's current health issues with covid, I decided to go through the drive-through. When I got to the window a representative named Vivian asked how can i help you, i told her that i had a app order, she told me i would need to come in to pick up order. I told her i have waited in line already here in the drive-through, she once again told me I would need to come in side because it's policy, I asked again can she just hand me my drinks. She shut the window and just walked away, no cars behind me at the time. I could see her and other associate inside laughing and proceeded to make me wait at least five minutes before another male associate came and handed me my drinks in a bag while she stood right next to him. It was 10 minutes after the time my drinks were estimated to be ready that they were handed to me so I know I was not waiting because they needed to be made. I find this to be rude and really bad customer service. Why cause she just not hand me the bag? I already paid and waited in line. Also my drink which was the ice cold brew had no sweetener and very light milk, that is not what I ordered.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Mar 31, 2019~Every time I come here my drink is wrong, be it size or flavor. Ordered a grande got a tall. Just today I figured I'd give this location one last chance since it's just down the street.  I ordered a blended matcha and there were huge chunks of ice still inside, couldn't even drink it. I think the employees here need some more training.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Jul 19, 2019~Second time to this location, as it is one of few coffee options close to the hospital. Was reluctantly greeted just as I was the first time. Very slow and I was the only one in line and the only person waiting for a drink, after waiting about 10 minutes I overheard the baristas in the back laughing that they forgot to make mine, a few minutes later I was called. No apology, no empathy, heck not even eye contact! no nothing!!!. Will now go out of my way to avoid this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~May 19, 2021~Yes, this shop is in a diverse neighborhood. We like coffee too. It is very clean and the service is pleasant and consistent. They always get my order right. I have noticed the employees are kind to the neighborhood people without letting them overrun the place. The music is lively and the employees seem to be having a good time, promoting an overall nice vibe when I walk in to pick up my coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Aug 11, 2019~Coffee always tastes burnt.  I honestly think they over-roast their beans.  Also heard recently that pesticides have been found in their coffee.  Going back to Grinders.  Not sure why I left in the first place.  Drivethrough, maybe?
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Jan 18, 2021~I ordered 3 drinks, none of them were filled (only about 1/2 way full, and my latte was literally just milk, yea just milk no actual coffee. i went January 17th to the Bethany and 7th Ave location at about 7pm. very sad
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Feb 10, 2019~https://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/starbucks-doubleshot-on-ice For next time...
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Mar 23, 2019~Finally a Starbucks in Sunnyslope. I like it because it is on the edge of the Walmart shopping center but not really in it. It is set back in its own little  area. I like this Starbucks better than the one at Missouri and 7th St. It is very clean and has these really beautiful large windows that give it a very light-filled and airy setting. The girls who  waited on us were super nice. I am looking forward to making this a favorite place. Will definitely be back to check out the breakfast sandwiches.
Phoenix, AZ 85020~2~Oct 13, 2019~The drinks/food always taste good &amp; the drive thru line always seems long but it goes quick which is nice considering I'm typically going on my way to work.. but I'm really tired of asking for my stars to be applied to my order and it not happening!
Phoenix, AZ 85020~1~Oct 11, 2019~Arrived at 7:45pm - all chairs were inside - we wanted to sit outside-no deserts out - no decaf coffee - creamer not even out - I had to ask for it - very disappointing
Phoenix, AZ 85020~5~Apr 10, 2019~Finally ma guy, most convenient Starbucks for Sunnyslope high school I would only recommend this Starbucks if you in the Sunnyslope area by the way
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Apr 4, 2023~Again, absolutely amazing things to say about the workers. Jason has recently taken over as manager and I have seen him be extremely rude to customers as well as the workers who have been here long before he was. It seems very rude and the workers seem severely uncomfortable working with him and it is uncomfortable being a customer with him there yelling at them...
Glendale, AZ 85304~4~May 3, 2018~Nice place for small working meetings or a place to camp out to get coffee, tea and get some work done. Several of my colleagues and I met at this Starbucks to get ready for a presentation. It was nice to see other people working on their laptops and make use of their strong Wi-Fi.I enjoyed my Citrus and Peach Green Tea Venti with light ice. It was refreshing and carried me through my meeting.The staff at this Starbucks was quick and friendly. I will be back.
Glendale, AZ 85304~4~May 31, 2019~Just  in for a quick drink because I was around the corner, the 2 barristers are very friendly and nice and greeted me very friendly. Service was fast and the place looked a very clean. Would be come back again.
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Feb 9, 2017~I hate to give 1 star but specifically stopped at Albertsons just for a coffee. 8:20 on a beautiful Wednesday morning to find it closed. I sat a while thinking the barista had to use the restroom. No note, nothing. Waited a few minutes. Left. Went to McDonalds.
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Jul 14, 2017~There is one specific barista that works there that is very rude. She has no customer service, she always says she's closed in the middle of the day; however, there is no type of sign showing there will be any type of inconvenience to customers. She refuses to make certain orders, she's always rolling her eyes and grunting at customers, not to mention she's always slamming around things while she makes orders. Can someone please remove this lady before she has some type of breakdown on a customer. I'm surprised if it hasn't happened yet. I don't even need to add a name I think a lot of people reading this review will know who I am mentioning.
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Jan 20, 2017~Apparently you can just leave the counter for 20 minutes as long as your leave a `"went to restroom`" paper slapped to the counter. After the guest services employee saw me waiting, she paged `"lex`" who was not quite happy she was pulled away from whatever she was doing. She didn't greet me with a hello or even a smile. Asked what I needed, slapped it on the counter and walked away. She was super pleasant!! Don't seek a barista job if you obviously hate being nice.
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Jul 8, 2017~Unacceptable when an employee gets upset because the drink is wrong and you ask for them to fix it, they are so upset that they go on a rant about how horrible their life is. The manager step in an fix the drink, that still doesn't make up for the experience. Will not be returning to this location.
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Jun 1, 2016~Starbucks is really overrated, REALLY! I can't stress enough how different the coffee is every time you go in there. One day it's burnt, the next day it's bitter. There's so many other better joints, mom and pops, small businesses, better tasting coffee, friendlier environments than this place!!! No I'm not an ex-employee, I just know good coffee when I taste it!
Glendale, AZ 85304~5~Nov 28, 2015~Thank you! Staff was friendly, coffee was hot, Batista helped us cali girls find a mug we needed...
Glendale, AZ 85304~5~Dec 1, 2014~I'm usually hesitant to go to a Starbucks located in a grocery store simply because their quality of customer service is lacking BUT today the gentlemen who helped me was amazing! Great service and amazing coffee:) can't complain!
Glendale, AZ 85304~5~Jun 28, 2014~I love this starbucks drinks are so good every time I go in especially when Julie makes them and all the employees are so friendly and amazing will continue to come here every morning before wk ....
Glendale, AZ 85304~1~Aug 30, 2017~I hate to do it but I have to give the Starbucks location one star. I should've reviewed this one along time ago but didn't want to base my review off of one experience. First I feel like this location is a knock off Starbucks. They are frequently out of ingredients &amp; the staff leaves you up front while they have to go `"to the back`" to re-up whatever it is they need to make your drink. When this happens on three separate occasions the employee has looked irritated that they have to do that for you. Solution: stock up! As if this wasn't annoying enough-they often don't have certain ingredients at all to make specific drinks that are on the menu. Who does your purchasing?  Secondly, there is a barista there with short hair and glasses who is the epitome of rudeness. She gets short with you, has no warmth about her, and can often be found in the morning talking to the same lady for an extended period of time while you wait for her to take your order by the register. My main complaint about her is truly her rudeness. She has no business interfacing with customers. The last thing that I will say is that I have often gotten my drinks made wrong at this location-this morning alone my initial drink was made incorrectly. And let me give a disclaimer that I'm not one of those crazy Java heads that orders not so off the menu items. I always order standard Starbucks menu items. So then then my second drink was made incorrectly this morning but I didn't have the heart to have this person to make it a third time. I was already now running late against my schedule. When I'm paying over five dollars for a drink while mistakes happen double mistakes are ridiculous. I will no longer go to this location-it needs either better management or to get with the program. Until then, I will always consider this location the red headed step child of the Starbucks corporation-a total sub par knock off.
Glendale, AZ 85304~5~Aug 20, 2015~Love this place!! Have been going here for several years and I never get a bad drink..no matter what I order. The staff is always amazing..super friendly...know me by name..and even customize drinks for me. I go here at least 6 times a week!!
Glendale, AZ 85304~5~Sep 20, 2015~When I go to regular Starbucks stores (not the ones in grocery stores), the drinks I get tend to really differ in taste even though I always get the same thing. It's like a gamble whether or not I'll get a good drink and considering how expensive it is, no one wants to take that gamble! But every time I go to the Starbucks in the Albertsons on 51st &amp; Cactus, my drinks are absolutely delicious every time! There's never much of a wait and it's cheaper than the regular stores because of the different tax rate for grocery stores! All of these things mean I drive out of my way just to get my Starbucks at this location. The employees are really friendly too.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Dec 18, 2023~This Starbucks needs to pay attention to all there promotions that are going on when working with Target. I went in today trying to use bogo free promo with the target app they said that it wasn't valid until Thursday 21st but the promo on the Target app states that it expired on the 20th which is a Wednesday.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 6, 2023~Asked for light ice, they forgot and when I asked them to fix it they just added water and shook it until half the drink was foam. There's another starbucks nearby, much better service there.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Aug 12, 2019~I now go out of my way to use this Starbucks. Michael is the best. Most of the staff have made it a point to know me. My drink is always made correctly and my son's favorite birthday cake cake pop is always fresh. I still hate that I can't mobile order but I will make the sacrifice to have my drink correct!
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Mar 21, 2019~I love this Starbucks. Ken was always my go to but he now works within the Target store. Isaiah now is usually working and he is great too. He always remembers what I order and makes my drink to my satisfaction which isn't always the case with stand alone locations. When paying over $5 for a coffee I expect it to be perfect. There is also another gentleman thats works the afternoons and he is great too. I just wish I could mobile order to save time.
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Jul 20, 2022~This is my favorite Starbucks ever. I have a special drink, venti brewed chai, and it feels so good that the crew knows my order. I feel so loved. That are always so kind and I never have any issues. Even when they are busy they remain so wonderful, polite and professional. This is my little Starbucks family and service like this really kicks off my day with such a positive note. Y'all are the best!!!!
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~May 16, 2022~Do not come here between 2-4 pm the worker at the register SUPER rude attitude unnecessary it's best to come when she's not working, she seems to be more busy with giving a target working free samples then doing her job or your better off going through a drive through on your way home at least they are nicer, &amp; cheerful she was just awful maybe because the guy blew her off and didn't even bother with her samples poor girl, sad. love Starbucks tho
Glendale, AZ 85302~5~Apr 10, 2021~I love stopping at this Starbucks when I have to shop at Target. They always get my order right and they are quick. A must have when shopping.
Glendale, AZ 85302~4~Mar 3, 2020~So today while I out shopping, and since they had a @starbucks inside the store. I'm not a coffee drinker so I rarely go into a coffee place. I got a sugar cookie and a chocolate croissant which was very flakey and chocolatey. The staff was very friendly and speedy. The location was very clean and upkeeped very well. So out of ratings for 1-10 I give the staff an 8, the cookie a 7, and the chocolate croissant a 7 my only comment will be if you are going to eat the chocolate croissant right away have them warm it up first.
Glendale, AZ 85302~1~Sep 7, 2019~I wish I can give them a zero but to bad it does not exist. Bathrooms are filthy dirty, Costumer service suck. I went and order strawberry Frappuccino and sat down and after 10 minutes I was called to be advised that they don't have strawberry syrup. So I had my money refunded. I also bought my little niece a birthday cake pop next thing you know the poor thing went home and had diarrhea after eating their cake pop.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~5~May 22, 2024~Of course a Starbucks is built here after I move from the neighborhood nearby  My fam moved down the road so this Starbucks is on the way and I've stopped a few times, no issues. The line is pretty quick. I usually mobile order because it's easier. I always get shaken espressos or iced coffee and they've been made right every time   I love that they have some merch outside of the drive thru window because there was a cup I was looking for and there it was. The barista quickly rang me up and I was on my way! Thanks Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85024~2~Jan 30, 2024~I recently went here to get a pistachio latte and some packaged almonds. Despite having five people working the counter and drive-thru, it took almost 10 minutes to get my latte. The drink itself was extremely disappointing-I could not taste the pistachio at all.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~5~Jul 7, 2024~Such nice people here. So kind and thoughtful. Quick, efficient and I don't want to write 85 characters.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~5~Jun 18, 2022~Awesome location! This one is always hopping because there just aren't many options for food and beverage around. They have one very large conference table in the dining room that is perfect for meetings.The employees are super enthusiastic and proactive. I loved that they had glasses of ice water to-go for guests! Both the drive-thru and dining room guests were taken care of.Cute, local decorations throughout which gave this location less of a corporate-feel which is refreshing.In a former life I, too, was a Starbucks Barista and can wholeheartedly recommend this one!
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Oct 8, 2023~It's a death trap in the morning with traffic coming in from two entrances, trying to merge into one drive through line. That, coupled with people pissed that you're blocking their cars in while you're stuck in the line that never freaking moves, makes this place more aggravation than it's worth. There are plenty of coffee places on the way to work that are faster, less irritating, safer, and have better service.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Dec 7, 2023~So I live right next to the Starbucks and for a while it was really good. But the drinks have started to suck and so does the food. I usually get the Banana bread or pumpkin bread. They never ask if you want it warmed up and today was my last straw. The banana bread was hardlike very hard and it tasted sour. I literally spit it out. Absolutely disgustingNot to mention the staff there doesn't really pay attention to their customers
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~May 18, 2024~Will never come back to this location. Not to mention they just going up in price and being stingy on refills while I'm in shop studying. I'm always able to get refills. Never again! Starbucks in general is probably going to be losing my business
Phoenix, AZ 85024~2~Oct 21, 2023~This location never gets the order right. I usually use the drive through and go. Every time I order a nitro cold brew, they give me some botched iced cold brew. Now I could go back and wait in the 15 car line up they have, but due to time constraints I just accept they messed up my order and I wasted $10 including tip, and I just move along. the kicker is Starbucks has implemented an `"tip`" option before paying. The staff is friendly, the location is clean. Just the service sucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Aug 6, 2021~Says on Google it was updated 2 days ago, saying it was open.Obviously it was not actually updated or anything because it is not open at all.There's no signage saying anything different either.Really disappointing to drive out here and try a new place, only to find it not accurately represented.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Mar 30, 2023~Half empty 8 dollar drink. Drink felt a bit light. Opened it up. Whip still there but drink still about 2/3rd full, same with second drink we got.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Feb 8, 2022~Never open You have to order through the application They won't allow anyone in the building but their friends
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Mar 4, 2023~I've gone to this location multiple times. Every single time I experience mean girls who act like they never grew out of high school. Just go the extra few miles and go to a different location, you'll probably be treated better. Last experience I had here, I was eating whipped cream in the lobby and the only other two people there (which were the workers) were looking at me and laughing. People here do NOT know how to respect other people! It's honestly a red flag that this business genuinely doesn't care about the bad reviews due to how the employees here treat customers. The people who own this establishment shouldn't even be in the customer service industry because they don't even care about their own customers!
Phoenix, AZ 85024~5~Aug 19, 2021~Went today for the first time when they opened! Their hours are updated on Starbucks website, (for the haters out there mad that google was wrong...). The inside is very nice and designed very modern, and the service was quick and polite.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Sep 5, 2022~Starbucks is worth going to for a great experience, usually. Then every once and a while you stumble upon entitled, rude people with a major attitude problem. Unfortunately this Starbucks has succumbed to this. I hope they have a staffing change soon so the store stays open the next time Corporate Starbucks makes a round of cuts. When we got to the drive thru ordering kiosk, Em started taking our order. I ordered an `"Iced Latte Breve with a pump of chocolate.`" Em then proceeded to tell me `"okay so you want an iced latte with heavy cream and half n half with mocha.`" To which I responded `"no I want breve, not cream.`" Em then got frustrated and Jamie took over. Jamie (Sadly, I believe this is the manager) was extremely rude. She said `"That sounds like a Dutch brothers drink. Here at Starbucks we don't use breve. Half and half and cream are the same thing.`"This is not true, as even the Starbucks app can tell you - half and half is breve and heavy cream is heavy cream. Breve is a term I have used at Starbucks regularly for decades. So to have someone patronize me in this way was unacceptable. We were going to drive away, but decided to show them what we want on the app instead. We drove around to the drive thru to order at the window. Em immediately started raising her voice at us, to the point where my daughter had to step in and tell her to tone it down a step. Em then scoffed!! And walked away to get Jamie. We explained what happened yet again and said the attitude is not acceptable, and it's not ok to talk down to a customer when we aren't wrong. Jamie then made her voice sickly sweet and said `"we just want to make sure your order is what you want, so we have to ask questions.`" This is utter bullshit, to be frank. Breve is a term used by Starbucks. To be talked down to by a manager and practically yelled at by an employee is unacceptable. And then on top of it - to have them do NOTHING about it. To stand firm in their attitude and insist that they are in the right. Not. Ok. Like I said, hopefully they have a staff change soon. For the sake of the other people who work there
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Jan 23, 2022~Truly the worst Starbucks of all time, I know that's saying a lot but it's true. Slow service, always run out of food. Now they are drive through only and don't have half the items, but since it's drive through only you still have to sit in the mile long line instead of being able to walk out. It should honestly just close down
Phoenix, AZ 85024~5~Feb 1, 2023~bro literally look at how much caramel is on there holy shit this starbies is so fire aswell i usually order a strawberry açai refresher with lemonade and one time they gave me a trenti when i ordered a venti literally made my whole day tbh but today i wanted to get something like rlly sweet and i ordered online which i usually do and they gave me so much caramel good god.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~3~Oct 22, 2021~Just went to this location for the first time tonight... I ordered the same drink I got from a different, (more established) Starbucks in a different part of Phoenix last night. The drink sort of tasted the same -- but definitely had a different look to it... so that was interesting. Tonight's drink was a little meh honestly. But by far the worst thing at this location is the overpowering sewage smell!! Unfortunately the city is doing some kind of work on the sewer lines and they are running above ground for like a quarter-mile... And the smell is indescribable. I was going to order a snack but that smell just turns my stomach so it's better to just get your coffee and snacks and drive away very fast! Oh but you can't... the traffic coming out of here is bad no matter what time of day or night. (Again, mostly due to the sewage work and lane closures). If you have the time, might be better to go south to Bell and Cave Creek until the sewer lines are back in their rightful place six feet unde
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Aug 23, 2022~very unkind , especially one worker with the name of Ashlyn . She has very poor customer services skills and is very rude . She was extremely short with me . I was trying to drive my kids to school and be in a good mood for their sake and instead I was left unsatisfied and insulted to say the least. Please do something about this attitude or train your employees to have better customer service .
Phoenix, AZ 85024~3~Sep 8, 2021~Chaotic location to get out off. It took longer to get out from parking lot than to get the coffee.Latte had no froth whatsoever and tasted too ordinary. Coffee cake was soft and moist. Nice modern interior and brand new feel is good.
Phoenix, AZ 85024~1~Oct 16, 2021~Unfriendly...worst Starbucks I've ever been to.  After I paid 8.50$ for scone and latte they would not give me a coffee refill. This place is getting way to greedy for me!   I will go elsewhere, hope others do also!
Phoenix, AZ 85024~3~Sep 22, 2021~It's a nice place, workers are nice, &amp; they work pretty fast but i've been there about 5 times now and my drink has been super inconsistent in terms of taste. I ordered the same thing every single time (same size &amp; everything) but my drinks are always taste super different. They are either really bitter or just sweet enough.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~Incredibly good experience while our first visit to this location. Super sweet service and cashier. They were welcoming and went way beyond with offer that saves $ for us. Store has good safety measures for corona. Marking with six feet distancing. Store is no entry zone. Order from the main door and receive your order at same place. They have setup a table on the door blocking the entrance. All associates had mask and gloves. Following all guidelines needed. Coffee and refreshers were just being Starbucks so no need to say anything about that. But service was fast and loved the experience while chatting with associates.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~Starbucks is definitely my fav! The coffee is so delicious. They always get it right. I've never had a bad experience with a staff member
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~5 people working, one taking orders &amp; one making drinks. Please make it make sense?!?
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~May 25, 2020~I LOVE this Starbucks. They're friendly and most importantly my drink is always made properly/the same no matter who makes it. My fav in the entire Phoenix area by far. When you're spending $10 on a drink, you want it to be made right every single time and that's why I go here.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Dec 9, 2023~Decided to meet a friend at this Starbucks since it was middle ground for us. The place was located in an outdoor shopping area. The inside was clean, but they were missing anything that would normally be at the condiments area (probably due to COVID protocols). The seating area was very limited. (Probably another COVID thing.) So we were lucky to find a table inside. There was outdoor seating but with it being over 100 degrees out it wasn't an option. I opted for an iced Pumpkin Spice Latte. This was the first time I went iced and not hot and it was good. My friend had a modified PSL but they did not get her order right. This is the reason for the rating. Also the team members working weren't very personal and just seemed in a hurry to get orders and get drinks out. All in all it was Starbucks coffee so it met their standard. We may or may not be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Nov 11, 2023~I came to this Starbuck's location Tuesday morning before going into the office. It doesn't have a drive through, so you'll need to park and enter the Starbucks.Inside the Starbucks location was relatively clean and well stocked. There are two registers. The staff at the location was super friendly and quite helpful. I had ordered a special order, the chicken, bacon, sausage biscuit, without the sausage. I also ordered a medium hot chocolate.Service was super quick! The individual preparing my hot chocolate put whip cream and chocolate syrup on top as well! The order didn't take longer than 5 minutes to prepare! I was in and out of this Starbucks quickly!The chicken and bacon biscuit was interesting. It could of used a little extra flavoring, maybe a added egg and additional cheese. The hot chocolate was perfect! Sweet and delicious! I'll be back here again for breakfast!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~May 19, 2024~Seems like a nice Starbucks overall, but I was disappointed to find that there were no outlets by any of the seating.  Was hoping to make this a new study location, but I'll have to find another unfortunately.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Sep 1, 2021~This place is right across the street from where I work , two times this week they have been out of cold brew.... They said (and I quote) `"they keep forgetting to make the cold brew`" I work in the food industry and that would NEVER fly at my work ..... they are great when they don't `"forget to make the cold brew`" ..... but who says that ???? And whoever is in charge of cold brew ..... maybe they aren't qualified? Just a thought ....
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~May 14, 2019~Walked in no one even looked at me to say hi just silence. Stood their for minutes to even get acknowledged, the girl says to go order? Saying yes shows my order hasn't come in yet even tho I ordered it 12 minutes prior to showing up. The blonde manager telling me I probably choose another location, assuming the customer was at fault. Order finally came in their machine when I made the order 12 minutes ago. The blonde manager then made the drinks, did not even say goodbye to me. Everyone at this location needs to learn to at least say hi to the customer. Disappointed
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Nov 11, 2023~Love coming to this Starbucks because first it's close to my house &amp; 2nd I'm a regular here &amp; they love getting to know their regulars. It gets super busy at this Starbucks though. I love using my Starbucks mobile order so I don't have to wait in line, cause sometimes the line is all the way to the door. Also when I do use mobile order it takes abit long sometimes cause it's super busy. My favorite drink is the caramel frappacino.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~every single time i order extra inclusions it's like it's there way of seeing extra and deciding to put half of 1 scoop... like this is not 3 scoops of inclusions...
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~Liam is a great manager. He was accommodating and honest and made my experience to this location a pleasant one.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~I've been waiting for 10+ mins not been acknowledged once. Not one employee will look my way. I had to stand where no other customer can receive there drink until they would acknowledge me. Lane a young female at the register could welcome everyone else into the store but me. Cidney lane and Karen have absolutely terrible attitudes. Do not stop here. Literally saw an entire building order there drinks and receive them before they could look my way. Typical young workers
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~May 12, 2023~Busiest Starbucks I've seen and I've been to allot.. waited half hour for iced coffee..something about their order processing/ mobile orders
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~May 28, 2022~They don't give you a full serving of coffee. I appeared for Carmel and got like one tiny line of it. I've been here twice and they don't seem to know what they're doing. Unfortunately for me it's the closest one to my job.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Nov 27, 2022~You can't go wrong with a pumpkin spiced iced coffee.    And it was waiting for me when I got to the end of the bar. This may have been the fastest service I have ever received at a Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Oct 5, 2022~Annoyed! The banana nut bread that I received was hard. I asked the cashier for a fresher piece. She informed me that all of the banana bread were the same. Strange response; however, I figured that perhaps I could warm it up once I arrived at work. Once at work and prior to warming, I opened the bag and noticed that not only was the banana nut bread hard, it appeared to be burnt (like it had been previously heated up). If I wasn't already at work, I would have taken it back. Instead, I now know not to visit this location again.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Sep 10, 2022~The drinks here are delicious but they are always so crowded. I used the app to order and pay ahead thinking this would help but no. Many customers were frustrated with the wait and there was only one drink maker. I arrived and my bagel was given to me without cream cheese and I waited 20 minutes for my hot chocolate and by then my bagel was cold as I waited for cream cheese too. I love Starbucks but this location has to do better at completing orders before jumping on new ones. I would say being more friendly would help too. I am willing to give them another try.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Sep 7, 2019~This is a well laid out store, the staff were friendly and welcome to accomodate my particular irregular choice!Parking in the mall can be a little chaotic. has wireless, outside seating with shade.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jun 17, 2021~Sweet/friendly staff. The place wasn't really too packed when I went in. My drinks were made correctly and in a timely fashion. Only thing I don't really dig about this location is how dim the lighting is. It makes me sleepy. I recommend it if you need a pick me up and you're nearby!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~I am not big on reviews and I typically will pick a small independent coffee house over Starbucks any day of the week. However the one in Barns and Noble on Happy Valley Road is the exception. The reason why, the people who work there. The are all very considerate, patient and excellent at customer service.If in the neighborhood, and in need of a coffee, this is the place.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~I have never written a review in my life but that upset me too much to pass up. I picked up a mobile order latte (grande) I felt it seemed a little light almost as if someone drank it. I opened it and this is what it looked like (didn't take a single sip). I told the baristas who told me this was normal for this coffee and were extremely rude. They said this is what it looks like. I order this drink multiple times a week it's never been this way before. 6 dollars for half a cup. This is basically a tall in a grande cup. I Will never go back to this location. Terrible service
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~~Just ordered the new black and white mocha. It's delicious. Sometimes their new drinks are overly sweet or just a little too adventurous, however this one is on point. If you are a big chocolate fan definitely try this one out. I'm hoping they keep this drink year round. So as far as the service at this specific location it's normally really good. I have gone in some mornings and the gals are overly talkative and it slows down the line. I try to avoid this location if I'm in a big rush. Anytime else during the week when you aren't in a rush definitely stop by this location, they will make you a great drink
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 16, 2017~Be prepared to guess when your drink is ready.They make the drink ok clean place but the Barista girl just wants you to guess and ask her which drink is yours
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jan 31, 2021~I came in yesterday and ordered 8 pumpkin spice lattes one for myself and the rest for my baby boys daycare!!! I got all of them safely over to the daycare while juggling baby and then got back out to my car to find that only mine which was soy was made wrong with no pumpkin so I took a big gulp of soy and espresso yuck!!! Hillary there made sure coming in this morning that I had a replacement as I hadn't the time to go back and trade it out yesterday! That is the kind of stuff good service is made in! Hillary and this location get a huge gold star!!! Thank you for making my morning!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Dec 28, 2017~Worse than before. Asked for a dark pour over (as for some stupid reason all Sbux stop brewing their good (dark) coffee after morning. Watched barista finish up the pour over and proceed to top it off from the tank of Pike! She brought it over and I said `"did you just put Pike in the pour over?`" She said `"yeah I wanted it to be full.`"  Clueless. Unbelievable. Manager remade it but took forever and NO real apology, get the sense they do it all the time.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Mar 2, 2021~The reviews are right -- slow, inefficient, small, poor quality shots of espresso (weak and not as hot as it should be). No drivethru. Avoid this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Oct 19, 2017~Stopped off here a few times when we were over in the area. They are always quick and efficent with moving through any lines. The staff is friendly and helpful.They even were kind enough to fix a drink for me when we stopped through after going to a different Starbucks close by that messed up my order in their drive-thru and we were gone before I tried it (too hot to try right away). The cashier was very nice about it.Overall: AGreat staff, quick to move things along and clean.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Dec 3, 2018~Having worked for Starbucks years ago I know what it's like behind the bar. What frustrates me about this particular store is it never really seems to be `"busy`" but they are consistently slow! I've been coming here since they built it and I've seen staff come and go. Still one of the slowest Starbucks locations I have ever been to!I'm not sure why exactly but nobody ever seems to be in any kind of hurry behind the bar. It's aggravating knowing I used to be timed at how fast my crew could crank out drinks at some of the busiest stores in Arizona. I am a loyalist, and I'll keep drinking the coffee, but I think I'm done here and ready to find another location to visit. If you're in a hurry, STAY AWAY from this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Dec 11, 2017~I was in the other day and the walls and shelves were very bare. Made me wonder if they're going out of business. PROS:1. Parking is easy.CONS:1. Extremely slow service 2. I asked for easy ice and ended up with a venti 3/4 full with ice.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Oct 15, 2014~Stopped in for a drink and I noticed a dog inside a car with windows cracked an inch. It was 97 degrees out. He was panting and looked in distress. The car doors were locked so I went back into the store asked the Manager to please call 911. I was shocked to hear that per company policy they're not allowed to call the police. REALLY?   Smh! How pathetic.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~~too focused on mobile orders, and don't acknowledge that to their cafe customers. i waited 15 minutes for a coffee, when they whipped out 20+ mobile orders that weren't even there waiting for their coffee. when i was handed my coffee, the barista seems almost annoyed to give me it `"here you go.`" no thanking me for my patience or apologizing for the wait - the most basic rule of customer service. the mobile orders sat their for at least 5 minutes before someone came in to get it. need to reflect on their priorities for customer service. my coffee was good tho :)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~I was so sad when the starbucks on 39th and pinnacle close down. I literally work 6 stores down. So I can walk down on my break and get my venti GREEN TEA WITH BERRIES. Yummmm. now that they move it to 39th and happy valley with a DRIVE THRU its so hard to go there. The line is so long and same goes to the drive thru.When they first open i went in and they recognized me right away and remember my drink instantly. Great costumer service and great drinks :)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~~Very friendly staff! Bathrooms were gross, paper towels everywhere. Nice location in Happy Valley shopping center!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 16, 2021~I don't normally leave reviews but today I was having, well, let's just say the most Monday-like Friday ever. It was bad. So bad that when I placed my order on the Sbucks app, I didn't realize I clicked a location over ten miles away from this one. When I showed up and noticed nothing on the counter with my name on it.... YUP! There was no escaping the worst day ever. Ugh. The gal at the register was so sweet and immediately took my order (as the original one was probably getting cold at the other location) without missing a beat. I was so upset and fighting back tears that all I could do was show her my order because any second I was going break down....Stressed and overwhelmed, when she asked my name I could barely say it without choking on my tears of frustration. My items were ready within, no joke, 60 seconds and I left just in time to dial into a very important conference call. I am so thankful that this location turned my morning around just by simply being attentive and understanding. Thank you to the morning shift today! I appreciate you!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Aug 19, 2013~Small location, no room to sit after the few tables they do have were taken.  Seems like a bunch of stragglers just bought a coffee and then all their friends sat down next to them to veg out all day.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Jan 9, 2017~Always serve up coffee as ordered.  Must have hit rush hour, as the place was pack and line to the door.  Baristas are quick and wait was not long.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jan 10, 2020~Amazing customer service. Hillery suggested I try a sample of the new mint mocha frappicino and it turned out to be fantastic. So loving this Starbucks and their customer service. I had to call tech-support for help with my mobile app and they were so helpful and quick.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Apr 2, 2017~I showed up a little after 5am... On a Sunday morning. The girl behind the counter was both cheerful AND friendly. The coffee was hot and tasted great, too: Five Stars for being open so early and seeming to be happy about it! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Aug 24, 2016~Horrible service. They messed up my DCC frap up! Like actually, they messed up my Double Chocolatey Chip up, and I asked for a refund. The lady said `"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?`" and nearly threw her stupid pen at me! How DARE YOU, Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~May 5, 2017~Dylan was so kind and counted out $6 in change that we used to pay for our order. Our Frappuccino's came out SO fast and we're delicious of course. Definitely recommend this Starbucks to anyone who needs one!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~Fast and friendly service.Inside was clean. Service station well stocked. Volume level of music and patrons calm and low-if I planned to hang out, it would be pleasant.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~I come in very early in the morning during the week, and in the early afternoon on the weekends - and the girls that are always working are so awesome! Once they've seen you a few times, they remember you every time after! They used to remember my drink until I started changing it up on them =)I will just say that I've gotten a Three-pump vanilla cappuccino with extra foam from here, and they've made it the best I've had from any other Starbucks. It was so good I drank it so fast when I normally sip on it slowly. They also know how many times I've checked in here, even on Facebook *giggle*.This location gets extremely busy because it's in a popular shopping center and it starts right around 6:45am up to 9am. I've seen the line going out the door so I'm glad I get there around 5:45am! I like this location the best not because of the coffee, but the customer service from the early morning girls makes it a great experience every time!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~~The wait here was atrocious!!! Took over 20-25mins for coffee (this was after we waited 10mins to order)?? I usually order the special (which right now is (Chestnut Praline latte with coconut milk..yum)..however if you are In A HURRY DO NOT GO HERE!!! Extremely slow service!! Coffee was good(same as other Starbucks just a Very Very long the wait) and they did make it right (nice enough too but didn't even apologize for the long wait?) ... Everyone else had the same expression is the wait really worth it for Starbucks chain coffee?? If you are ever in Bay area try Philz!!! The wait for coffee is worth it (.mint mojito at Philz is my addiction!!!)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Aug 5, 2016~I'm giving this location 4 stars because it's usually very good, but I went here on Saturday at it was absurdly slow.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Dec 9, 2015~I must say, we went in Christmas morning and all the young people there were extremely nice, wide-awake and did their best to make sure everyone had a great experience.  They were even celebrating because one of their co-workers had just graduated from ASU.Great team work especially since my husband and I are pretty certain that they would've rather been home enjoying the holiday with their families.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Dec 27, 2015~Had coffee here twice both times the coffee was terrible. I had a latte I don't know how they can mess up a iced latte the coffee taste really bad seems like it's set for too long very slow act as if they're extremely hurried. Good thing it's not close to my home will be going to other Starbucks for much better coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Feb 27, 2019~I come to this starbucks quite frequently and have never had bad service until recently when Jesse started working there. Every single encounter I have made with him I have received nothing but attitude and rudeness back. Sometimes he starts off nice and then quickly escalates to an attitude when it isn't even a high stress environment at the time. I don't usually write reviews but it's really unpleasant when one person can make your favorite go to place your least favorite.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Dec 26, 2015~The staff makes this a great store! They often remember me and asks where my daughter is when she doesn't accompany me like she normally does. They are usually pretty busy and seating is scarce in this location. If you are going to get work done it might be hard to find a spot. And if you do find a spot, it might be hard to get work done.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Jun 27, 2018~Located in the strip that faces Lowe's, just a few doors down from Ray's pizza.  I've had bad service a few times at this location, the seating is excessively limited, and the parking can be bad at lunchtime because of the surrounding lunch spots.  Worst time is a weekend at lunch when the lunch parking &amp; Lowe's parking are so bad that it fills the span of the parking lot between the two.There are a lot of young college aged kids working at this location, so that could be part of the problem.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~May 30, 2019~My drink order consistently gets messed up. The Baristas do not listen or pay attention. Not to mention half the time the lid is not on the cup all the way. My least favorite Starbucks but it's close to work.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~~Slowest Starbucks ever. Line from the register to the door and yet absolutely no sense of urgency or desire to speed it up by employees. If only recommend coming her if you have a lot of time to spare. There is no drive thru to help with orders which may effect the speed. Might be good for a weekend relaxing but not for wanting to grab a coffee before or during work.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~This location is excellent. The staff is always friendly, rarely out of any ingredients and have great consistency in drinks. The baristas are quick, listen well and never mind making something right if a mistake happens. Hillary is my favorite person in the world!Please don't go to this location though, I like the lack of line ;)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~~The latte and croissant was very good BUT the barista decided to go outside to his car and was more interested in what was happening outside than in making the drinks. Don't know if he was concerned about the police outside or what. He totally lost interest in my coffee when he was halfway done. Another barista took over and I finally was served. In summary coffee good barista mesmerized by the world outside.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Sep 1, 2017~This is the slowest starbucks on the face of the earth. And they don't even have a drive thru. It took 15 minutes to get a breakfast sandwich and coffee, after I reminded them I was still waiting on my sandwich lol. There were four employees present.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 21, 2015~Megan matinas amazing!, she gets her job done and makes everyone's day 10x better than it already was I beg you give her a raise!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 2, 2017~Great baristas that work hard. Very busy in the AM between 6-9 and especially so on Double Star Day. Mobile Order is awesome, but you have to disregard apps wait times and you need to wait a bit longer for your drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Nov 12, 2019~I haven't been to this location since in a while. My drink and food was great, as can be expected. The only problem is they are allowing pets inside. This dog is not a service dog.  Leave the animals outside.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Jun 11, 2017~The barista that took my order seemed kind of annoyed that I had a few transactions to take care of. Once I placed my order, I patiently waited for my drink...I then saw the individuals who were right in front of me get their drinks and I was thinking I would be next. I stood there waiting for the barista to start making my drink, I watched her pick my cup up and set it aside as she continued to make 4 other beverages before getting to the beverage I ordered. I watched 4 people behind me get their drinks and leave before I was able to get
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Feb 8, 2018~I've yet to have a bad experience here.  I'm always greeted and served promptly.  Although, I only come in during off-peak times.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Jun 6, 2017~Basically your average Starbucks. The baristas are friendly enough, the seating is rather limited and the parking can be a pain depending on the time and day you go. I go here out of convenience when I need a frappuccino or white chocolate mocha fix. Nothing spectacular, but also nothing horrible about this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~~Its November 2nd...yesterday I enjoyed the Thanksgiving blend without the tryptophan after nap and didn't have to wear my stretchy pants either. Today I went for it. Full on Red Cup Skinny Peppermint Mocha, that escalated quickly into the holidays.  Oh yeah, it's AZ, I've got my flip flops on and I'm on the patio. At least my pedi color matches my cup.  Otherwise it would be so awkward.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~Never get my order correct through the mobile order, and even completely lost my mobile order to collect stars. Waited over 15 min for this order. Finally asked the barista where my order was and she said they didn't have it so I showed her my mobile order receipt and she made the drink and of course made it wrong. So I asked if she could fix it, cause lets be honest if your going to pay 6$ for a coffee you've been waiting on for over 15 min, you want what you ordered. Well upon asking if she could fix it, she went ahead and made yet another persons coffee before mine. Great customer service. (Complete sarcasm) I'll be so relieved when a Dutch brothers comes to norterra.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~If you like a coffee shop that literally screws up your order every time - THIS IS YOUR PLACE!!! My order is simple, pike place with heavy whipping cream and stevia. The only thing that changes is the quantity, do I want 1 drink or 2. And more often than not, ITS WRONG!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Nov 2, 2014~Awesomeness. The coffee is great!We are pretty new to Starbucks and the person helping us have us some free samples of coffee.The cake pops are amazing! Definitely recommend. Super nice staff!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Aug 27, 2017~Food quality and taste aside due to it being a chain restaurant the thing that sets apart Starbucks from each other are the people behind the bar. This location has some great, friendly people who tend to make a consistent drink. Like other reviewers have mentioned, this location can get slammed (especially around 9AM) but it is a function of high demand as opposed to incompetent or slow baristas.Overall, a good location with stable, amiable staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 22, 2019~I cannot say enough great things about this staff!  They always make the perfect drink and they staff is AMAZING!  Tammy, Hillary and Rene are phenomenal women!  Their service is second to none and are always so personal with their customers.  I have not been to another starbucks that had a staff half as good as this one!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Dec 14, 2016~I'm a general contractor and as the old saying goes, time is money. Well if that's how you operate your life than this is definitely not the Starbucks for you. I have been in there probably a half a dozen times and every single time it has been the absolute slowest experience of my life. The people behind the counter just go on and on and on chatting with one another and tiptoeing through the tulips. I don't understand how it can be that slow when every other Starbucks is so quick. Normally I would just go to a different location. However this happens to be right next to Lowes. So when I go to pick up my material in the morning this is my only option. They need a new manager, someone that can change the culture.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~May 26, 2012~At first I was disappointed that they moved from Pinnacle Peak because that location was across the street from my house. However, their new store on Happy Valley is so much nicer. Great staff &amp; excellent drive thru service!The people that complain about the slow drive thru are probably the same people ordering all their `"special`" drinks that aren't even on the menu.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jan 9, 2016~By far the most friendly and happy Starbucks I have ever been in. Usually I go through the drive through (because of my laze craze) but this one did not have one, FORCING me to go in. I'm so happy I did, the costumers were happy and seemed like they knew the staff well. The boss had her kids (on her day off I assume) and they were having a blast with one of the male baristas. Thank you Happy Valley and i17 for putting a smile on my face.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jul 26, 2016~Baristas were perfect, personable, and fun! Ordered Two of the same drinks and there were amazing!!! One of the best Starbucks experiences I have had!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~Always slow! Like, HORRIFICALLY slow. Counter girl is always worried about what the others are doing rather than paying attention to taking the orders correctly. These girls would NEVER make it in a real city setting! They would be CRUCIFIED!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~Extremely friendly staff! Great vibes at this Starbucks. The employees always make you feel like home here.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~The baristas at this Starbucks are so busy socializing amongst themselves that you have to wait until they finish their story to get your coffee.  I suggest you bypass this store for another of the multitude of other Starbucks in the area.  Once the management teaches their employees to put the customer before their own need to socialize then maybe you will get your order in a timely manner!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Jan 21, 2017~My daughter (who is very beautiful)  was just totally ingnored and treated like she wasn't even there by the staff!   We are from VA where you just don't do that.   They really need to learn manners.    Apparently the woman in front of her was treated like an old friend.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~May 8, 2016~If your a regular there, your drink always seems to be ready quickly.  If your not, well um then plan on waiting. I've come across a few employees there that are in the wrong line of business. I know how I like my $6 cup of coffee and it shouldn't be so hard to write it like I order it on the cup. My drink is always wrong if one employee in particular takes my order.  Don't get me wrong, there are several nice employee there that you can tell they love working there. But there's always a bad one or two in the bunch to ruin it for all.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Dec 5, 2016~Not my favorite staff here, but the drinks are pretty consistent and as long as you order ahead with mobile ordering you'll be all set.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Nov 5, 2016~I wish I lived closer to this location! starbucks customer service and friendliness has REALLY gone down hill. BUT this location is AMAZING! Such great and nice staff! And fast service!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~4~Sep 1, 2016~I love this location. Prices are normal for this chain andparking is convenient.  Pretty quick service and lots of smiles
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Mar 15, 2018~My favorite Starbucks to go to! Always have to go pick up a big order of coffees for the office and the barista Lexi is always so polite and helpful.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~Jun 19, 2018~Service at this location is faster than the one on Pinnacle Peak Road (about 37th Ave).  But it still takes some time while the servers chat with their regulars.  Seems odd they cannot make the beverages while talking.  And work faster.  This company should know people have places to be.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~I come here everyday before work and I love that the baristas make an effort to get to know me. A few actually know me by name when I walk in the door. Not sure if that's a good thing or it means I drink too much coffee.  ;) Either way, I love everyone who works here.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~~I ordered a simple iced tea and waited about 8 minutes. All while a couple of people that ordered after myself and others received their drinks. There were two employees working in front and I'm not sure if it was because one of them was new or what the case was. The family ahead of me had to wait even longer.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~It's a Starbucks. Friendly staff at this location. They get the orders right and they are what it seems staffed properly as the line and orders are done in good time.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Jun 29, 2017~This is hard to say... But I do not enjoy my visits here. They are slow, crammed, difficult to get in line, and even harder to find space to wait for drinks or even fix my drink after. I love SB but this one needs a bigger store and better service.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Mar 24, 2016~Seriously the best Starbucks in AZ. We live right near by and are frequent users. The staff knows us and our usual orders and are ALWAYS friendly. We are and always will be loyal customers to this particular Starbucks. The only con would be no drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Jun 5, 2016~Horrible. Waited almost 10 minutes just to order (at 7:45 am) as people in front of me ordered multiple drinks and multiple food items. One cashier, one barista, one person making food. Patrons stacked up waiting for their orders. Left without my drink I'd already paid for, as I was out of time.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 14, 2013~I love this Starbucks location! All of the staff is very friendly and my order is made perfectly every time. The baristas are patient and take their time to ask you about your day. I, of course, drink Starbucks a lot, and I would recommend this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Feb 16, 2014~This location is so convenient being across the street from me, but their customer service is so horrible. All employees have the worst attitudes even when they make my coffee incorrectly. I gave them so many chance but never again. I havent stepped foot in this location for months. I have to travel couple extra miles to another Starbucks that gives such a great customer experience. WORST STARBUCKS LOCATION!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Jan 28, 2015~The floors were extremely dirty. Bathrooms need attention. There were only two people working, and they chatted more than they work. It took over 20 minutes to get a drink. I suggest you drive the extra mile and a half to the Starbucks at 29th Dr and happy valley. A much better  Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Sep 29, 2015~We all know that there so many variables that can go wrong during the morning preparation for work, all of which have the potential of starting the day off on a negative note in some cases these things can change the course of the whole day. This morning my experience at this Starbucks was just the opposite.. The drive through line was short and the team was not only friendly, but extremely knowledgeable.As a former Starbucks employee I can say this team is rare! Consistency is key to me and they've got it all!! I pass by two other Starbucks locations each day to this store because I know they will help me start my day off right every time!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~~This Starbucks store is super crowded in the morning. Expect to wait 15 minutes for your order. The sun is hot and blinding inside, making the wait uncomfortable. Staff was nice. They work like machines cranking out many dozen drinks in rapid succession. Sucks for them and totally not relaxing to watch. My suggestion is to find a less marketed coffee shop if you want to experience a cozy cafe experience -- an experience all but lost at most Star bucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~Been to this location many times but every time it takes forever to place my order and forever to get my coffee. I at least wait in line 10 minutes and then 15 to get my drink. There are at least 8 people behind the counter all talking to each other with no work being done except them discussing their personal things amongst each other. Other locations do not take this long to get coffee. More focus to the customer instead of each other employee would help speed up the line and produce even more sales. Other locations provide faster service and they even have a drive thru! So if you want to use your whole lunch hour to only get a cup of coffee this location is the place for you!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~~I go to so many Starbucks and this place by far is the best! The morning crew always greets everyone with a smile and that kind of customer service is very hard to find!!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Feb 8, 2017~I go here a lot.  Everyone there is friendly and remember me and my drink that I order.  It really don't get any better!  This place can get busy with a long line at times...
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jun 16, 2017~I love this store! The staff is kind and patient. I highly recommend this branch. They even helped me with my homework!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 19, 2014~Great people, they make a real effort to remember everyone that comes in. They always say hi to my little girl too. Great coffee and customer care. I will always go here before other locations.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Sep 9, 2012~I absolutely love Hillary, she is the nicest person and will go out of her way to help her customers and make sure you have a drink that you will love. The rest of the staff is great but Hillary really stands out to me . Thanks Hillary for all you do.  Tammy
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Mar 22, 2014~i used to be an everyday regular here. baristas knew me by name and had my drink memorized. service was always slow ... friendly (most of the time) but slow. but i kept coming back because they knew me. stopped by again thursday morning, hoping it had improved. it hadn't. from the time i walked in the door to the time i got my coffee, i had wasted 17 minutes of my morning on a damn latte (yes, i really did time it). screw it ... i just don't have time for this place. if i have an outrageous amount of time to waste, i happen to need coffee, and i'm in this parking lot, i may return, but probably not.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~Nov 7, 2014~The worst Starbucks I've been too! Horrible service! They shut down their oven 35 minutes BEFORE closing on a week night and informed me AFTER confirming they have a sandwich and after they charged me. I don't like to write ANY reviews, let alone a negative one but this Starbucks should be avoided!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Jun 10, 2015~The staff here is very nice there is just never enough of them. This is not a single occurrence. I was third in line this morning and from the time I walked in until I walked out it was 13 minutes.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~i have been to this starbucks so many times and they continue to disappoint me. i have had two orders they didn't do right. a worker there is rude and i'm not going there again
Phoenix, AZ 85085~1~~If you  want the slowest service when 2 people Are making drinks  then for Shure come here.... This is why old people shouldn't work at Starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85085~3~~I'm new to the area and have used the mobile pick up a few times. The first time they were not accurate on the ready time and I had to wait an additional 5 minutes for my drink. The second time I ordered it with a few extra minutes so I could just grab it like I'm suppose to. I go to put my straw in and I can't. The ice was just a chunk so I had to ask for them to get it out and put normal ice in there. This last time I just went and my drink was not in the mobile pick up area (the tri level platform) and instead was just with all the other drinks. So I stood there and waiting only to find out they didn't place it in the right spot. Why have a certain spot for things if you're not going to utilize it?? While I was waiting I overheard a woman ask if the steak sandwich had avocado spread and the Starbucks lady said, `"you have to ask for it.`" It says it's on it on the menu, but she argued with the lady about it. I've been going to Starbucks for YEARS... not going to that location anymore even though it's so convenient!!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Jul 16, 2018~I love Starbucks for the yummy very berry drink but the girl there this morning had such a tone and negative attitude.   I wanted to remind her that her job also requires a smile and positive experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Aug 18, 2013~Very helpful.  Barista took the time to explain perks that will keep us coming back! Thanks Hillary!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jul 21, 2017~I am a Canadian and was in Phoenix for the winter. I ended up walking up to this Starbucks most mornings for a Latte, and very soon was welcomed by name by the staff in the store. They were all positive, wonderful, friendly people. When they were busy they always apologized for the wait. I am back in Canada now and miss my Starbucks visit each day. I am looking forward to coming back to Phoenix next winter and will definately have this store on my schedule when I return. The coffee is much the same in all the Starbucks I have been in. What makes this a great store is the fantastic staff!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Nov 5, 2024~Slow service... Drinks take forever to be made, regardless if they are busy or not. When I use my mobile app at this location I give it a good 20mins before I show up. When the drinks do come out while you are waiting the employees rarely call out a name, they just put them on the counter and never look up. Overall the employees are rude and rarely make eye contact or have any interaction with you. When you order a cold drink there is rarely enough ice in it. Music is always too loud and most of the time, the genre they are playing is not exactly Starbucks approved... The only reason I continue to go to this location is due to convenience. Hopefully somebody from Starbucks corporate or someone that cares from this store sees this and makes some changes to this location for the good.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 10, 2024~Leo was great and I would like to thank him for cheering up my morning. Good luck with your competition!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jun 16, 2022~Wow. Just not a good vibe.Tables and chairs smashed against very hot windows. Only spot not that way basically in the trash can. Two male employees only interested in yelling stupid repetitive jokes to each other while female doing all the work.Grimy. (See pictures) I wanted to chill for 10 minutes with my overpriced long awaited coffee and as I sat almost in the trash can the genius guys cranked really disturbing yelling `"music`" that came on suddenly and about gave me a heart attack.AWFUL
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 28, 2023~I tend to order through my app, but on my trip here I did that and ended up adding something else when I got here. I love books, and they have a mini library set up in the corner. I don't spend much time inside, I like to grab my items and go, but I could see the perks of hanging out here. They even have a couple places to sit outside if you choose. The service is good and so is the atmosphere.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 10, 2023~The lady at the cash register today was so sweet and bubbly! I didn't catch her name but whoever was the cashier at this location this morning at 7:55am you are such a kind person and I really appreciated that!! Be sure to tip those who show up to work :) I like this Starbucks because they are fast and efficient as well!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 9, 2023~Still love going to my 43rd Ave. and Thunderbird location almost daily I always get an iced caramel macchiato grande bring a Venti cup, so I can get extra ice and double caramel!!!! Love in a cup lol.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 17, 2023~43rd and Thunderbird is the best Starbucks ever!!! Always make my drink perfectly(3yrs and two months straight) 59th and Union Hills has messed up 3x now in 3 months!!!!Keeping at one star so 59th doesn't get any credit.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 16, 2023~Wow I really got screwed over today.. straight milk.. plus I order a grande with extra ice and a Venti cup and this is what I get!!! Corus more it was often listen milk milk with a little bit of coffee. They did not offer to remake it for me or anything like that. Usually do this place to stay straight zero. Don't let the Carmel color fool you.. it's caramel milk lol absolutely no coffee in here. I will update on this next time I go to Starbucks somewhere else. Show what a Starbucks drink is supposed to look like.  This review will be posted on Google, Facebook and Instagram.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Sep 2, 2023~Kasia the store manager is amazing. She runs a great team and is the best at talking to her customers. Store is always clean organized her partners are always super nice and respectful. Food and coffee is A+ as well
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 17, 2018~This place is usually packed with people either studying or just chilling. Love their caramel frappacino. Also you can order your drink thru the app and have it ready when you get there.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Sep 13, 2021~I grab Starbucks pretty much every Friday for my kids. My normal location didn't have my daughters drink but this one was close and had it. They do not have a drive thru however, they do have curb side pickup. Inside was clean and organized and our mobile order was ready to go as soon as I walked up to the counter. The employees were friendly and I'll stop in again if I'm close. Thanks!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 24, 2023~One this that this location knows how to do is to FCK UP YOUR DAMN DRINK!!! I get shaken espresso every day and i try to avoid this location as much as i can but unfortunately i live close to this one so on the weekends i end up getting some here and get coffee in Scottsdale WHICH HAS THE BEST LOCATION! This place needs to shut down!!! Staffs have disgusting attitude when you call them out on a drink they fckup!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Apr 14, 2023~I stop here and pick up a mobile order every morning! The last few fridays has been a complete joke the people are slow as shit and work with sense of urgency. Mind you I place the order around 620 every morning and it take me just a couple minutes to get there but it's always ready minus fridays I walk in one drink is ready and the other is stand the while these two people take there sweet time and watch my drink sit there and the sweet cream foam just need poured on it it sat there for at least 15 minutes till I said something. Then the excuses started. The crew on Friday is a joke and I will definitely not be stopping at this on fridays ever again I will drive a mile or two out of my way to work to save time from here on out!!!The Friday crew is the reason for the 1 star and I wouldn't of even put that if I didn't have to! As for the crews Monday threw Thursday they kick ass and my drink is always perfect!!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~May 17, 2022~The team members at this particular Starbucks are the best and Starbucks is very lucky to have them, in particular Allison and Gilbert.  Alot of personalities pass through their doors and they pretty much keep their cool remaining polite, even when being spoken down to (can't use the `"b`" word here!).  They pretty much know their regulars and it's nice to be acknowledged for all the $$$ that get spent here weekly.  I figured out that monthly it's the same as my car payment!  Thank you for being the best in the Arrowhead area of Glendale.  Corporate should be proud of you.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jul 4, 2020~Completed a mobile order for this location and was told it would be ready in 7-10 minutes. Arrived after 5 minutes and was immediately greeted by staff. They requested my name and already had my order (wrap and drink) ready for roll. What more do I need from Starbucks? My only complaint was they were a little heavy handed with the milk in my latte, but it still was good.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jan 21, 2023~Honestly, I love Dutch Bros. But the the ridiculous long lines through it's drive through service and in-person service is definitely a drag. While the customer service is absolutely amazing, the employees should stop having personal conversations with customers while the lines are backed up. On top of that, its customers are no doubt extremely picky with their choices which further creates the long lines. There is no doubt that Dutch Bros KNOW their lines get like this but do nothing about. Using the same, tired, outdated, servicing model. Do better or lose customers.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Feb 6, 2018~This Starbucks sucks waiting over 30min to order bc some girl in front of us `"claims`" she works at a different Starbucks but doesn't know her employee # or anything... she was ordering 10 drinks got her other job bc I guess if you work at a Starbucks you get a buy one get one free deal?!? Soooo were waiting and waiting and let's add this girl was a total bitch to everyone. Pretty sure she doesn't work for Starbucks because their staff are always so overly friendly it's awesome.So finally we order we are basic venti iced coffee with classic/vanilla cream. One I'm sure the staff is all annoyed and flustered by this annoying girl.. BUT don't mess up our drinks mainly when it's written on the cup what we get!!! Omg we already waited 30 min come on make our drinks right. No joke just iced coffee with cream So sad but I hope next time we don't run into this issue again.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 28, 2019~Friendly baristas, they had my nitro cold brew w/sweet cream ready before I even sat down &amp; playlist is poppin' - major kudos! Used to coffee over hipster tunes playing in most places, so not sure if it was today's specific playlist or if they always play the slaps but it fed my throwback, 90's/00's R&amp;B soul!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~May 10, 2019~Go to this Starbucks on occasion while my husband is at the chiropractor next door. I always mobile order when we are at Bell so you'd think my drink would be ready...never the case at this location.Order a Trenta Mango Dragonfruit refresher and one Grande Mango Dragonfruit for the offspring.  When entering there are about 3 people at the cashier ordering. The barista behind the counter is working quick but the girl in front of me must have had 10 drinks he was making. My son and I wait...and wait. Several people that came in after us and ordered at the counter have now left while we still wait.  So I finally ask. Oh sorry we only have one of your drinks. We ran out. Ok shit happens I get it but one would have thought since I was standing there for so long one of the three people working would have asked what I ordered. And to add insult the `"manager`" said you only ordered 8 minutes ago...so I get a Pineapple Black Tea Lemonade instead, or so I thought. The girl with the indian accent even asked do you want it sweetened.  Finally get my drink. Walk back to the chiro office and find it's just black tea. Not pineapple infusion or any hint of lemonade. I probably won't be going back. Two stars because the `"manager`" gave me a $4 gift card for the inconvenience of no refresher.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Aug 12, 2017~Pretty typical Starbucks location situated relatively near Midwestern University. Tends to get a bit crowded during peak hours though there are extra tables outside. Service is swift and drinks come out at a relatively fast pace even when the place is packed. Definitely a good location to grab coffee, study, or chat.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jan 19, 2022~The staff is friendly! It's smaller and cozy. They have a tiny book shelf with books to read!!! This place makes me happy.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 18, 2021~Second day ordering through the mobile app and having the drinks made poorly.  Cold Brew tastes like hot coffee poured over ice, espresso shots were so watery that my husband's latte tasted like straight  up milk.   Staff has seemed nice but the product sucks
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 16, 2017~I went to this Starbucks location yesterday after I messed up on my mobile order. I meant to send it to that location and accidentally sent it to the one by my work. I walked in, explained to the barista what had happened and BOOM! she instantly grabbed a new cup and started taking the order for me. It really meant a lot to me that she did that. I hope that someone from Starbucks corporate sees this and gives the staff a high five for me because they truly deserve it. That's exactly how you would hope your employees would treat their guests. Thanks for my green tea frap with protein! A full belly and a smile really go a long way!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 12, 2022~These people work very hard at this location. People and their stupid mobile apps.  To the lazy customers who are TOO lazy to get out of your car and walk in like normal people. (Curb service) To the customers who use your stupid moble apps and drive in, fly out of your vehicle and crowd the counter as to keep people from seeing their coffeesplace. To the IDIOTS who sit in their cars with the engine running while people are sitting outside trying to enjoy their coffee. Absolute Idiots.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 29, 2017~I came to this location because it was close to my moms house instead of my usual and it was pretty busy. It was pretty dirty even at the pick up counter. I always do mobile orders and this one was a little chaotic. They keep mobile orders behind the counter and you have to wait for someone to notice you. Just was not a good experience.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Dec 29, 2015~Quite possibly the slowest Starbucks in AZ the barista today looked like he was confused on what he was doing. The guy who took my order asked what he could get me and then started having a side conversation with his coworker a female and then turned around and looked at me and said I'm sorry what can I get you?? ReallyI called and warren answered the phone and his excuse was well in case you didn't notice were busy??? Your barista doesn't know what he's doing dude! If your that busy as you claim to be hire more people
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Sep 3, 2019~My favorite Starbucks in my area, and I live next to a newly opened Starbucks store. The employees are all so sweet. I never made much conversation with the baristas, but they all know who I am, so now I do mobile orders and the minute I walk in they already know it's me and hand me my drink. There's a guy that works at this Starbucks in the morning who is awesome. For how busy it is they all work so quickly.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Feb 5, 2018~I gave this Starbucks another try.  Much better!! Friendly and glad to help.  I'M HAPPY NOW!! Thank you Jason!!Long wait for my chai tea latte that taste like warm milk. I threw it out. I'M NOT HAPPY!!! Starbucks chia tea has been a favorite of mine for a while now. I've visited numerous Starbucks in my travels and never been so disappointed!!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jan 31, 2018~Long wait for my chai tea that it taste like warm milk. Threw it out. I'M NOT HAPPY!!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Sep 6, 2020~Shelby, Thank You!!! For always smiling, helping me figure out how to work my app, helping me order my coffee the right way  You're AMAZING AND I APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU DO
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Mar 3, 2019~Perfect Starbucks, friendly and fast! Always upbeat, great place to work online. I recommended this Starbucks, adding a Drive-Thru would be nice.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 17, 2021~they are the truest and friendliest of baristas!!  always being challenged and always coming through with a smile on their face!  They are all truly remarkable!  I just enjoy going there, it makes my day! and for some reason, they are the ONLY ones that can get my mobile order correct.  insane.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 10, 2018~I love their service! Mobile order is the way to go with this Starbucks since they don't have a drive thru. You get skip the line and will get greeted by your name by their morning employees if you happen to become a regular. I wouldn't recommend trying to get work or studying done unless during mid afternoon. There is not enough space and it seem chaotic during busy times.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Sep 27, 2019~So I love Starbucks I get the passion fruit tea lemonade sweetened. The barista messed up my drink and didn't sweeten my drink and I waited even longer because she messed up the drink in front of mine and the drink in front of that drink. It could have been just a bad day. when i walked back in because I noticed my drink wasn't right once I walked outside I was like this drink isn't right and the girl just gave me a blank stare and was kinda like what do you want me to do and she's like what drink did you get. Kinda with a attitude.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 27, 2018~I love this location, even without a drive thru. They're quick and accurate employees make it a quicker trip than the Starbucks closer to my house. I've grown accustomed to preordering on the app and picking it up on my way to work. I've noticed too all the employees no the regulars by name. Very welcoming team there!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Feb 28, 2018~usually stop here on our way out of town and have had no issues. Good decent starbucks. nothing to complain about
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~May 31, 2018~This is by far a Starbucks that needs the most work. My drink is never right and I order the same thing every time every Starbucks. Why do I return? It's the easiest one around to get to. So I am a repeat customer and at this point accept that I will receive a subpar drink.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jan 28, 2018~Incredibly slow service. They need coffee there selves. Hardly any people here and still took over 20 minutes for my order
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Apr 5, 2018~Why is this place closed at 8:30pm? I've tried several times and yup, closed at 8:30pm. Dude sweeping the floor obviously doesn't have any will do make me some drink. Please do something.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~May 4, 2015~I am pretty much a Starbucks addict {hey- admitting it is the first step, right?}... So I had been frequenting another Starbucks for several months until my route to work changed and I decided to stop at this Starbucks instead, which was a big change b/c the other one was a drive thru. After the first cup- I was hooked on my new Starbucks location! The drink was 4 times better and they were way friendlier! I think the  volume of the business takes a toll on this location- yes, and it is hard to keep up. HOWEVER, I see people in their daily sitting at the tables utilizing them (inside and out) and regular customers... that means they are doing something right.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Mar 31, 2018~Not enough ice and it tastes watered down already. Girl making drink wasn't too pleasant either. Won't be stoping here again.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Mar 17, 2018~Yes it's a franchise but they're not all the same. Things such as keeping the coffee as fresh and hot are part of the foundation of a good coffee house, and this one performs. The staff is friendly and dedicated. I always enjoy coming here, thank you!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~May 3, 2011~Pretty standard Starbucks. Friendly staff. Hot/ cold drinks....Right next to Midwestern's campus and it closes at 9:30?!?! NINE THIRTY. Where the heck is the closest 24 hr Starbucks??!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jun 20, 2020~It's Starbucks so everything is good. This location is not my fav, I had a wrong order (didn't realize until too late) and lengthy waits for drinks. I will obviously so back since it's Starbucks but if there's another option I would go.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Nov 22, 2017~My favorite Starbucks! I've gone to every one in the metro area. I like the 'take a book-leave a book' and they have the reserve coffees which I prefer over the pike/Christmas on tap at the other stores. Their quick to fix things if anything goes wrong and the bathrooms are always clean.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Dec 27, 2019~Worst customer service I have received at a Starbucks , Carrie was very rude and kept telling me to wait for no reason. She also kept rushing me while I was giving her my order and would not wait for me to finish talking. Then she goes to say it's small medium large, like if I was unaware of their sizes and names. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Apr 27, 2012~This is one of my coffee sources before a longday's work. Staff is very friendly and consistent- doesn't seem like there's a lot of turnover here.Quick service and they always have my favoriteChicken salad with Tarragon sandwiches when I actuallywant to eat something as well. The only bad experienceI had here was when some obnoxious fellow kept askingif my name was Dan - I guess he was just trying to figure out which customer there was his Craigsfist (sp?) connection.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Apr 20, 2015~Yuck! This place was so dirty! Napkins and trash all over, dirty windows and tables. They had half and half out only for my coffee... And the people!! I don't think they even knew I was a person. I have been to TONS of Starbucks... This place by far takes the cake for the most disappointing! Sorry won't ever go back into that one again. Really makes me appreciate the others and what a great job they do.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 28, 2017~Love this location right by my house! One of the baristas knows me by name as soon as I walk in.. I feel so bad I don't even know his:/ amazing service and they make the best drinks.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~May 4, 2014~New guy Arthur.  Learn how to treat customers better. You were rude today!  I LOVE this location. If you don't improve will choose another.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Feb 28, 2014~I'm from Ohio and I LOVED my local Starbucks.  I have to give this location a 5.  Always friendly....ALWAYS getting my order correct....as busy as they are the line moves quickly.  Newly remodeled and looking fantastic....not my Oakwood location but the next best thing!  This is my 2nd review.....and the baristas are still making my visits awesome!  I thank you!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 26, 2013~This is my FAVORITE Starbucks. Friendly folks.  They ALWAYS get my order right and thank me for coming.  I visit as often as I can!!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jun 12, 2014~Good spot to get a coffee,  but the attitude of some of the baristas need to remember that they are there to make coffee. My friend and I were both told what we wanted would take awhile instead of saying it will be longer than usual,  it's like they dreaded the thought of brewing coffee....aye
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Feb 26, 2020~Disappointed again getting a cold coffee on the way to work.  Almost went back but was in a hurry.  This is why I usually avoid this Starbucks because it always happens.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Dec 31, 2019~Brought my 3 girls in to your store over winter break as a fun treat, we usually stop at a store close to their school.  Carrie was so helpful and patient as I let each of my girls place their own orders.  We will definitely be coming back.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Mar 5, 2019~Disappointing. Went there yesterday and waited forever for my mobile order. No one acknowledged me. Turns out The guy who made it, left it behind the counter, as he was off for the day. No apologies made to me. Waited 20 minutes for watery coffee. Was in a hurry so didn't get anything else. Wont be back.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 9, 2012~This is my regular coffee spot, even though it's not even the closest Starbucks to my home. The employees are FANTASTIC. They always greet me and my grandparents by name. They have all our drink orders memorized. They make the BEST drinks by far of any location I've ever been to. If they don't make it right they go above and beyond to make it right for you for free. My only complaint is that they haven't hired me yet! ;)
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Feb 6, 2018~Love the employees. Greet regulars by name. Are patient as we decide if wanting to try something new.  Clean and comfy seating.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Dec 23, 2017~They are extremely slow. They need a minimum of two cashiers.  They only have one the many times I've been here.  They also need to clean the cream and sugar area more often.  Not my usual Starbucks experience that I have had at other locations and cities.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jan 24, 2019~Thursday 1/24/2019 at 9 a.m. English is my second language I'll try my best to tell you what happened to me at this Starbucks store. I was awaiting for my iced tea and a coffee an young employee gave a an iced tea first while I was waiting for the coffee accidentally I dropped the iced tea all over floor the employees right away came and cleaned up the mess for me and I was planning to buy another Iced Tea but the the same employee gave me another tea right away without charge. .After I got my iced tea and coffee I opened the doors to get out somehow I accidentally I dropped Iced tea and coffee all over the floor again I was so embarrassed to picked up the cups, said sorry to everyone but everyone was just smile and gave me the looks that they understood the situation and forgave me my mistakes. Again Starbucks employees helped me out and offer me another iced tea and coffee with all the beautiful smiles.I did trying to pay for the iced tea and coffee again but she said she loves to give them to me again without charges.It was a bad morning at first but I saw Starbucks employees and customers at this store were so nice to me. I'll never forget yours kindness. You guys are awesome. Goddess you and peace to be with you always I'm an American now and I'm very proud to be part of your community.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Aug 21, 2016~Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon, the place was dirty, trash overflowing. They got my (very simple) order wrong and the guy gave a bit of an attitude when I pointed it out. It's 100 degrees and I'm sitting outside because it's dirty &amp; freezing in there. No thanks.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Feb 17, 2016~This Starbucks has slowly gone down hill, one of the girls who takes my order almost any evening that I come here is always really rude and she always messes up my drink when she writes on the cut but has no problem charging me for soy. And then when I tell the people who are making my drink that is supposed to be made with soy because I can't drink milk they decide they're just not going to put any whipped cream on it which I wanted. I constantly have to have my drink remade at this location and every drink tastes different even though I'm ordering the same drink. I really feel like consistency is an issue with a specific Starbucks, maybe it's just me.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Oct 15, 2018~Received the best service tonight from Jaeden (I believe his name was) and recommended me a new drink, which was exactly what I needed! I asked which drink would best keep me up for an exam tomorrow needing to study all night and he recommended a vanilla sweetened cold brew w/ extra caramel &amp; extra shot of espresso. Thank you, J
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Dec 22, 2015~Slow service... Seems like they aren't in any hurry.  Waited for my drink right by the barrista while others came and went.  Finally looked and my drink was sitting there.  Never heard him call my name. Whipped cream completely melted. Other than that, the drink was fine.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 9, 2017~I am always pleased with this location/staff/service! One employee always stands out! Her name is Susie (manager)! I love everything about her! She has a great disposition/attitude/she is so knowledgeable/helpful/very polite...She is a big ASSET to the Starbucks Corporation!!! She is the #1 reason that my friend/ I go there!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Nov 7, 2017~This is my usually location when I do drink Starbucks. Today was just way off- girl couldn't get my order right at all and it was a simple order but took 4x--my tall iced vanilla latte w/ caramel turned into: tall hot caramel latte, to a vente iced vanilla latte..I think she just wasn't focused... My drink tasted like ash because the guy making it was pausing a lot to chit chat. Maybe it was the timing. (Around 4:30pm) cause usually it's fine and not awkward.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jul 22, 2018~My favorite Starbucks! It's always the same employees working and they are so extremely friendly. They greet me instantly by name when I walk in and it seems they are that way with a lot of people who must be regulars. It makes for a nice environment when they remember names and details about you. Especially when they already know what your order is! ;) amazing staff! See ya'll tomorrow. :D
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jul 7, 2015~This Starbucks location is all right.  I feel that one of the employee need to be aware of their facial expression, especially when there's an interaction with customers at the register...perhaps a friendly smile would go a long way, after all, their job is to provide customer service.  I am sure this person is a nice individual, I would like to feel welcomed at this location when I come back.., if ever .... I felt not welcomed here and would feel uncomfortable coming back to this location.  Otherwise, the rest of the employees are great!Might I add, if you just want to read a magazine or a good novel, this is the place to go.. Maybe....However, due to sometimes high noise level, either with music or employees who really enjoy their job, (good for them!), this will not be a place to go if you're trying to understand a physics concept or trying to understand the functions of the nephron.  LOL!
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Feb 1, 2010~Located at SE corner of 59th ave. &amp; Union Hills, this small location always seems to have polite and prompt service.  The only downfall is the smaller than average seating area, and given the proximity to the medical college nearby it can be hard to find a seat.  Just a few doors down is Rosatis pizza and a new Spanish tapas bar, so it's in a nice location within the strip mall.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 26, 2018~i love starbucks and the staff. i pretty much live at starbucks. the drinks and food are amazing and the staff is always welcoming and willing to fix your drink every time if you're unsatisfied.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Feb 25, 2014~I used to like this Starbucks, but now I love it.  They just remodeled Jan 2014, and now they have a Clover brewer.  If you are a coffee fan, then make sure you try the Clover!  I like that they have remodeled.  Also they have very friendly employees.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Nov 5, 2011~If I've come to your Starbucks over 30x within 5 months and you still don't bother learning how to pronounce my name correctly then I don't know what to say. I always order the same drink: quad espresso with 3 pumps of white mocha and 80% of the time they don't get my order right! The baristas always ask if I want water or milk with it.. Seriously? I ordered a damn espresso for a reason. If I wanted water or milk then I would've ordered something else and NOT an espresso! And my drink is one of the simplest drinks to make too!! Just brew 4 shots, mix in white mocha syrup and add ice.. But they always somehow mess up by asking me stupid questions. If it weren't  for this sb being the closest to school, I would definitely frequent the Thunderbird location!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Feb 4, 2016~Coffee tasted awful, never had this bad coffee before. Ordered a latte, but it tasted like water. Won't ever go back to this place ever again.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Mar 2, 2014~They're incredibly slow. Give yourself extra time if you come here. The first few times I tried to justify it by guessing they must be short staffed or have the `"B Team`" working but No... Every time I go to this location I wait in line for 7-10 mins before they even take my order. Maybe this doesn't sound very long but I go to Starbucks bc it's fast and easy. If I wanted to wait 15 mins for coffee I would go to some local coffee shop.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Aug 15, 2012~My sister and I come here a few times a week if not more. I will have to say that mostly the only reason i keep coming is for one of the workers here .. Mercedes ALWAYS makes my drink PERFECT. If  not for her, none of the other girls make my caramel machiatto right at all. But Mercedes is so very friendly, she remembered my name from the get-go and not too long after memorized my drink (which is pretty detailed and specific) This Starbucks is always packed (good for them). There are a few workers here who are not friendly at all and really need to take a few customer service classes (but i have found this is the came with most Starbucks.) But this is definitely my favorite Starbucks :)
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 29, 2015~Went in for my coffee at 11am and they are out of vanilla flavoring. Obviously not a well stocked location !
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 12, 2015~I met a new potential client here for my side health and fitness business.  He ordered a cameral mocha something or other and I got a water.  Service was fast and his drink was good.  My water was amazing.   The dude with the long goatee was hysterical.  Overall the place was quiet and it was easy to talk.  Perfect place.  I will be back.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Dec 28, 2013~This seems like a pretty hip place to hang out, grab a drink and people watch. So busy every time I come here and the parking is not too bad. A casual hangout and lots of groups come here as a meeting spot. During the weekdays a lot of students are doing homework but all in all, great service and decent place.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Dec 30, 2012~Staff is friendly, service is great. Drinks are fantastic!
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 5, 2015~This Starbucks is my go to after every workout and a convenient place to meet friends! Friendly staff and very quick service!
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Sep 4, 2014~Nine am on a thursday morning and not one piece of toilet paper in the restroom.  Really??? Um yeah I just drank coffee.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 11, 2014~Negative baristas heaven forgive they mess up your order and u ask them to remake it. No asking if it was right the second time, still not right but they are so rude ur afraid to ask for them to actually try it again. Also soooo sloooooooowww come on people drink some coffee and get motivated... lets work on niceness and speed.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Aug 25, 2015~Excellent coffee.   This location is always super busy.  I would suggest buying/leasing the space next door and expanding, better yet we have no drive through coffee location going East from this location off the 101 freeway; make that happen and you would be the most popular Starbucks in the surrounding.   Other than that excellent coffee.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 18, 2013~Impressed with how friendly and efficient the staff is. Can't complain about the coffee either.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Dec 8, 2013~Love Starbucks! Friendly service and love the coffee. They always get my drinks correct and I never have any problems or complaints.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Feb 16, 2014~This is by far my favorite Starbucks. I go here at least once a day well headed to work and the staff is always friendly getting my drink in a timely fashion. The advantage at this location is the staff has been there for a very long time and have wonderful team work.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Jul 7, 2015~Great coffee, but two male employees were yelling (jokingly) with each other for over an hour.  Too loud with employees and music cranked.   Not the best day to try and study.
Glendale, AZ 85308~1~Jul 7, 2015~Let me start off by saying I've been a Starbucks gold member for a few years. I mostly go to this location since its closest to my Apartament and used to really like it. The baristas knew me by name and were generally friendly and attentive. Recently a lot of the staff here has changed in the worst way possible. One afternoon I had come in to study for an hour or two and had purchased a hot white mocha with my gold card. I stayed inside the entire time (sat at the bar area) and before I was getting ready to leave I went back to the register to ask for a tea refill. I brought back my empty cup and took out my gold card when the barista said `"you can only get a tea refill if your original beverage  was a tea and it has to be within an hour of your first purchase`". I asked if she was sure about this, and she turned around and asked a male coworker who nodded to her and she turned back around and gave me an annoyed `"yup`". Baffled I thanked her anyway and left. As soon as I got home I went through every Starbucks faq page I could find and on each one the rule is clearly stated, you get unlimited free refills regardless of the original beverage purchased with a green or gold member status ( and no mention of any time frames whatsoever). Now let me clear, I don't mind paying $6 for a cup of coffee all the time, or the fact that my name is butchered on those darned cups, or even the bored and annoyed facial expressions the baristas always seem to have.... But when I'm denied a measly tea refill that I'm clearly rightfully asking for and bombarded with false rules that are nowhere to be found on any official website I officially give up. The audacity of the management to not train or supervise their staff properly is baffling. I've since fallen in love with the coffee bean near my place and never plan on returning.
Glendale, AZ 85308~3~Jan 8, 2016~The apathy was so thick you could cut it with a knife (my subject header). I have thought about writing a review for this location for the last year when declining positive service and long wait times became the norm. But today was really frustrating, so I finally made the effort. About to order and just realized that I had left my wallet in the car I asked the order gentleman at 12:15 on 1/8/15 if he could begin a Oprah chai tea for me while I got my wallet. I told him I was in a hurry and he could see I had waited patiently already and then there was a line of 8 people behind me. He remarked he could only prepare the cup (with a really unpleasant attitude) which I thought meant he would get the drink in the que and started. At Starbucks we are used to them smiling, asking about your day and even writing your name on the cup. This was absent but more troubling was the complete unwillingness to help. Got back in line with a $20 out and asked the gentleman if he had started my drink...no he had not...decided to leave, out of time. When I left I couldn't help feel sorry for the workers, they looked miserable and apathetic. Long line and just 1 cashier and 1 on the drinks...2 doing assorted work never looking up to help move patrons along or even acknowledge with a smile. They obviously don't like working there and had no accountability to the place of business. This usually means being poorly treated by management/leaders. I give them 3 stars because I think these apathetic workers due their best with what that locations management is offering them. I hope work conditions improve for them in 2016!
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Feb 18, 2015~Standard for a starbucks. Usually with great staff that I really liked so far. Until I ordered coffee from a girl with rude attitude working on Weds afternoon, who needs more training in customer service. I've worked in service before, and this is not how I'd train my staff. First time I ever felt very annoyed at this location. Other staff members are great, but I'd rather go to the Fry's starbucks island than come for attitude if that happens again.
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~Jul 12, 2016~Whenever I stop here it is always full and I wish I would have gotten a table sooner with this heat. Diane is always sweet and makes my drink perfectly. I don't know what the other reviews are talking about since when I go the staff is friendly and personable.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Apr 1, 2016~Always friendly and coffee delicious! Love to walk here from my house and sit and drink my coffee. Caramel macchiato is delicious! Usually busy but the employees do great at keeping things moving along!
Glendale, AZ 85308~4~May 4, 2011~What the heck can I say? They've got my money and I admit I a little bit of a junkie. Staff here is quick and friendly, place is clean, busy as usual... I hate that they're close  to my job.
Glendale, AZ 85308~5~Jun 29, 2014~I'm not the kind of person who orders the same thing every day so their patience with my choosing is great. They always recommend something when I don't know what I'm in the mood for and it always hits the spot. The one down side to this location is the wait. Often the line is put the door and there is no place to wait for your drink to be ready. The added room from the remodel didn't solve the problem but it did speed things up a little.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Dec 7, 2014~I love the location of the store, all the baristas are very friendly and nice, and my drink is always made right. However there is a customer -*Dave* I believe his name is, who is beyond annoying. He is there every single morning and when he sees me he starts talking loudly and joking and making sarcastic comments to me. I don't even know him!!! He does the same with lots of other customers- as well as the baristas. I can't stand it. I have started going to the Starbucks up the road, in the Frys store. So much quieter and no harassing old men.
Glendale, AZ 85308~2~Mar 13, 2014~I would not recommend going here in the afternoon of Tuesdays and Thursdays especially if you are tight on time. I usually go here before class because it is on my way so first time I went it took two girls 30minutes to make my drink and on top of that it was made wrong but after that point I was running late so I couldn't have them make me another drink and who knows how long would that take. I decided to give them another try and this time only one of the girls that serve me last time was working. I was first in line and she made 4 other peoples drinks first before my drink was made. The guy that was working with her came back from the back and asked me if I was still waiting for my drink and only then she said that my drink was next. At the end when I got the drink she threw the straws on the counter versus giving me one.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Jul 16, 2024~Just paid $6- for ice, ridiculouscheck out the pictureJust paid $6- for ice, ridiculouscheck out the picture
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Aug 16, 2023~I was nearby for an appointment so decided to grab Starbucks for a pick me up. This location is connected to an Einstein Bagel, they share a bathroom. Anyway, it was ok, small inside. There was no wait so I got my drinks. Staff were friendly. Didn't look newer inside, could use some updating.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Mar 14, 2021~SB well located at Thunderbird and 59th ave.It is very small, with no indoor seating but there is a nice patio. There is no drive thru. Staff is very professional and quick with orders.Recommended above avg Starbucks.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~May 26, 2022~This was once my favorite Starbucks location. A while ago, the excellent manager that was here left and things have gone downhill ever since. I come in here a couple times a week, but today is my last day. They didn't have a dark roast available and they were not willing to give me a pour-over, unless it is Verona. Yes, they had Komodo Dragon in the store but I was told that they are no longer able to do that. I don't know if this is a companywide policy, but other locations are willing to do it. It's either time to find another location or a new coffee place...
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Nov 17, 2023~This location is great ! I want to thank Becky for being so awesome !!!! Someone accidentally took my drink and she remembered my order once I told her my name... I couldn't believe it ! She really is amazing !! Thank u Becky for making my day... and thank u to all the ladies there today! U guys Rock!!!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Nov 12, 2023~I've had with this Starbucks!!! This is the WORST location!!! It says they close at 7PM and everyday is a different closing time, sometimes it's 3 pm other days is 4pm then it's 6pm! Which one is it??! That's why in this location you can't order ahead because in their system it has it open until 7PM! So they turn it off!!! Its ridiculous! I get it close it early but MAKE UP YOUR MIND ON THE TIME and change it on the website!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Jul 5, 2022~Idk if they got new employees or just a barista but my coffee taste like milk, my tea taste like water, and frappes taste like shaved ice. Get it together, Starbucks is expensive and even when I tell them if they could remake it, the remake is still very gross. I'm very upset about this, this was my favorite Starbucks but lately Starbucks has been failing because it's not only this location but various ones. There's measurements for a reason USE THEM STOP BEING LAZY and USE THEM!!!! Staff is nice.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Oct 13, 2019~Now, I'll start off by saying I LOVE Starbucks. However, with that being said I swear they have a contest of which store can have the worst parking lot! Lol all the Starbucks in my immediate area have horrible parking. This particular Starbucks does not have a drive thru either which I don't mind but I know can be a make or break for others. This Starbucks is attached to an Einstein's Bagels which my kids love so sometimes a tea turns into a drink and bagels when we come here. Everyone here is very friendly as I find with all Starbucks I go too. I will continue to come here when I'm in the area and I need a drink fix. Thanks Starbucks for making my mornings brighter!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Oct 18, 2021~Go in five employees one person taking orders, one customer placing 10 orders and no one else will serve you ?Terrible !No common since, everyone is in a daze !
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Jun 21, 2023~Excellent service. Recently moved to the area and this location is clean, friendly and timely with orders.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Feb 13, 2019~Another great Starbucks location for the win today! I was in the parking lot after lunch at sushi and a quick stop at nothing Bundt cakes and was really craving their peach white tea with heavy whipping cream and sugar free vanilla. The man at the resister was amazing, funny, friendly, chatty and even offered my a larger drink when I ordered for .50 cents more and I did it. You only live once and he was awesome. I wish I had gotten his name. If you're reading this it was February 13th around 2pm, has an awesome beard and the best service of any Starbucks employee I've ever encountered. This location is pretty small, but clean, organized and fast. I was in and out within minutes and that included home orders that kept coming in. Way to go !
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~May 10, 2023~I only place mobile orders but this location is the only one I consistently go to that actually greets you and asks if you need help if they notice you've been there for a few minutes. Also my drinks always traste the best. If you like sweet coffee, try iced white mocha with cold foam
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Apr 28, 2019~What is with mobile ordering all of a sudden? It used to be when I ordered via my app when I'd get inside the place my beverage would be ready and waiting on the counter, it was like VIP service. I've found out that is no longer the case! Ordered via app on a Saturday morning, about 11ish. My first disappointment from this Starbucks is according to the app they didn't have mango dragonfruit so I ordered just a simple pineapple black tea lemonade. Inside was packed. I Waited. I Waited. And I waited some more. People that were ordering at the counter were getting their drinks before me. Several that were 4th and 5th in line received their frappuccinos before my pre ordered ice tea. Probably stood there a good 10 minutes before I received my drink. My drink was ok. Mostly ice and it needed 1 more pump of liquid sugar.With the new changes to their rewards system and the wait times I find myself going less. Get it together Starbucks, you are about to lose a loyal, go 5 times a week, sometimes twice in one day customer!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Jan 1, 2022~Visited this morning and ordered a flat white. Unfortunately I waited until I got home to try it and realize they gave me a cup of steamed milk.  It wasn't even that it was a weak shot of espresso, but that the espresso was completely missed and it was just a cup of plain hot white milk. Didn't care enough to go back to down the drain it went.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Feb 17, 2018~Pretty standard Starbucks attached to an Einstein Bros. It tends to be quite crowded on weekend mornings/afternoons, but that's to be expected. Drinks come out at a good rate and service is so great! The employees are all really nice and efficient which definitely earns this place some points. Swing by if you have a Starbucks coffee craving or are in the area picking up a bagel, grabbing a bundt cake, or shopping away at Safeway.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Feb 21, 2022~Lexi was great!   This location always has such a smiley crew!     In particularly Lexi, she was very attentive and took my order over the phone.   I appreciated that very much.    I would recommend this location for sure :)
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Sep 22, 2021~20 minutes for a chai? For a mobile order..Really? Was the lid on too tight? or maybe it was the cold foam that was holding it up.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~May 23, 2021~This is not a knock against this location but whyyy isn't there any gf options? Gluten intolerance and Celiac is a growing issue but Starbucks is one of the few chains that ignores this! Put a gf wrap on the menu. Non gf people will eat it too. Please!
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~May 21, 2017~I like that you can get (just about) the same experience at every Starbucks location. You can always get the drink you like too! This store is smaller then some of the other Starbucks around. There are just a few tables inside. The room has a nice, modern feel to it. Even with a lot of shops in this area parking is pretty good. You can always park near the store. Oh, and they do share a hallway with Einstein's Bagels (which is pretty cool).The employees are nice and you can tell they enjoy their jobs. They get your drink to you promptly. I like that Starbucks gives some benefits (like free school) to their part time employees. This seems like a really good company to work for.Starbucks has a rewards program as well. You can become a gold member after you spend a certain amount of money and then start earning free coffee/food.I would recommend Starbucks to any coffee drinker.
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Sep 13, 2021~Placed an online order for a coffee and egg bites at 1:45pm. Rec'd confirmation would be ready at 1:54. Arrived at 1:55, 2 guests in the store at the time. Neither item was ready. Coffee was ready shortly after arrival....eggs not until 2:08.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~May 13, 2019~Always busy and always a friendly smile at the counter.  Thank you for all you do to keep the world caffeinated.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Jan 28, 2022~Andrew is the best at this location. Always going above and beyond what they are required to do. Only giving 5 stars for him! Promote Him Now!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Mar 21, 2021~It took over 30 minutes to get my two drinks. Their excuse was `"there's a lot of mobile orders`" but I kept seeing people who ordered in person after me getting their drinks/food first. Very disappointed! I will be taking my business elsewhere.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~May 8, 2020~Due to the covid apparently, they couldn't take our order and needed us to order on the mobile app. What we wanted wasn't on there. When we asked for help the lady was so rude. So rude in fact that her co-worker gave my daughter a $5 gift card as an apology. And the icing on the cake.... our order ended up being wrong.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Aug 3, 2021~Love this café! It's really cute and I love the atmosphere there. Been going there for the past 4 years and all the staff are friendly. They always get my order right and perfect!
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Sep 25, 2019~This Starbucks is hit and miss depending on the barista working. Bottom line if a business wants to charge $5-7 for coffee they don't have much room for error. They need to get it right more than once every fourth visit. Unfortunately, this location regularly forgets to put in cream and add ins, makes the same drink different ways depending on the crew working, and isn't very attentive if you ask them to correct it. They often don't have drinks or pastries in stock that the 43rd &amp; Thunderbird location stocks. Out of their control, there is also a good chance you will get stuck waiting for over 15 minutes because the nearby hospital staff places enormous mobile orders with 10-15 drinks. This Starbucks is basically meh!
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Apr 25, 2021~I no longer drink coffee (got addicted awhile ago and I cut it from my life). However I went it to get some for my friends. The barista there, kind older gentleman with classy circular glasses, was absolutely amazing. He was incredibly funny and helped me navigate the menu. I can't stress how welcome he made me feel! Even though I don't drink it, I will be getting my friends coffee from here again!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Jul 11, 2018~Definitely not the best one I've ever been to. I often have to have my drink remade, and I don't really order anything special. Today a coworker picked up drinks for us during lunch and I ordered a vanilla sweet cream cold brew, my usual. I always get the same thing, either the cold brew or a iced vanilla coffee with just cream. Today's drink was literally undrinkable! I took 2 drinks and it burned going down my throat! There was almost no cream in it, and was as thick as can be. There was a layer on the bottom of my cup approximately 1/2 inch thick of sludge. I called the store 3 times and no one would answer. The pictures are of my drink after it had been sitting for a half an hour, watered down. After work, about a hour and a half later I went right straight there to have my drink remade properly and show them what I was given. The girl behind the counter said they would fix it and dumped it out in the sink behind her, intending to reuse the same cup with the sludge, until she say the look on my face. Right away she said they would use a new one, and put the old cup inside a new one, and rolled her eyes at me when I said thank you. The guy making the drinks was so quick to push me out of the store. I was embarrassed and took a drink as I was walking out the door and albeit the drink was better than the first, it still had the same burnt bitter thick taste. After they way I was treated I wasn't about to ask for it to be fixed a third time, so I dumped a bunch of half and half in it and walked out the door. I had a couple drinks and threw it away as soon as I got home.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Sep 11, 2016~Out of all the starbucks I've been to in AZ so far which has been around 20, this is by far my favorite. it does not have a drive-through which is a downfall at times, it is a smaller Starbucks because it's connected to Einstein's bagels....So there aren't very many large tables inside it's I'd say there's about eight tables or less... But the line is never that long the service is always quick and the staff is my favorite! They are always super friendly, and genuinely care about each person that walks in the door... I don't feel like just another customer when I visit this location, it feels more personal. thank you for all being awesome!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Jan 22, 2021~This location is by the far the worst I've ever been too! I ordered on the Starbucks app and when I arrived waited awhile. They made it 7 minutes late. I asked for light ice and the whole cup was full of ice. I also know the exact color it's supposed to be and it was not the color it normally is so I knew they did not make it correct. Too busy and not enough workers. Please step it up please
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Aug 24, 2017~This is probably the only Starbucks in Glendale that actual prices correctly. They are also extremely consistent with the drinks. I've been to other Starbucks and my drink is either over priced or it taste water down. I am extremely happy with this location and its staff!!!! Thank you so much for being amazing!!!
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Dec 13, 2019~This place does not have a drive thru, but I don't mind.  The cashier has worked there for years and I always enjoy his warm and welcoming nature.  There is another Starbucks on T-bird and 83rd, but it is always busy.  My chai tea was perfect and the Barista was very nice, as well.  I will definitely try to drive a little out of the way to go to this Starbucks for the exceptional customer service.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Nov 1, 2013~This Starbucks gets the `"Congeniality`" award :DWhy?*They share a hallway with Einstein Bagels! 2 of my favs connected :)Other things I like:*plenty of parking*never too large a crowd*friendly staff*police presence (there always seems to be 1 or 2 vehicles in the parking lot)Areas for improvement:*a bit slow with getting the drinks out. *although they ask you for your name, they don't call it out when your drinks ready, which causes a bit of confusion.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Apr 24, 2015~Clean store and friendly staff! Usually go on Sunday afternoon so there's usually a little long wait
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~May 7, 2010~If you are in a hurry and need your java fix, keep driving to the next Starbucks...or go to QT on 67th Ave/T-bird for coffee. The parking here stinks! The tiny lot shares parking with Einsteins Bagels and Blockbuster and is crazy. I just want to park and run in. There's always a line here too, but they make the effort to get the coffee drinks filled quickly.Not a Starbucks location that I will go out of my way to stop at, nor one I would impulsively stop at either.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Mar 8, 2011~If i have to choose between this location and the one on 43rd Ave. It has to be this one..  Why?  Because here, they get your drink out in literally 2min or less.  Im not dogging the other location because they do great on the drinks, but my God.. you can spend 20min in the drive-thru at times. If you want fast, friendly and awesome service, this place kicks all kinds of ass. :)
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Jul 27, 2015~OK, so I am not a big Starbucks fan.  In the ten years I have lived near this one I have been in maybe five times. This trip was actually for a gift card.  Even before 6AM as they were still putting away inventory that had arrived late the previous day everybody was cheerful and friendly.  They walked me through picking a card and I was out of there in quick order.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Feb 4, 2019~This store is in an area that has impossible parking BUT that's not the stores fault. I've never had them make a mistake and when they've run out of something (that I've ordered on my mobile app) they substitute with anything I ask for. They are fantastic! I had to change stores because the awful location at 43rd and Tbird always makes a huge mistake or takes 20 minutes per visit which has made me late for work more than once.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Aug 15, 2020~This location is 5 stars all around if they didn't have this one female manger. Ever time I come here and she is working it's craziness going on. She's very rude as well and half the time she's not even helping her team. The other male manager is awesome ! Everything is smooth and everyone is happy. But when he's not there no one seem to be happy to be working at all.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Jun 29, 2018~Sydney at this store made my drink so perfectly . I ordered the ultra caramel frap, with extra caramel at the bottom and the top, and it's AMAZING. I've requested extra caramel before and paid extra for the caramel that was already supposed to be on the drink... But Sydney understands the concept of extra caramel (as you can see) and it made my day! I'm very happy with this location . Sydney needs a promotion!
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Oct 16, 2019~I think it's really dumb you have to have so many characters on yelp to submit a review so I'm trying to make this long enough to post. Sigh. But really all I wanted to say is, this Starbucks has the freaking fluffiest roasted ham and Swiss sandwich. K bye.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Jun 12, 2020~When I walked into this Starbucks, it was empty. A man walked in right after me. I had ordered TWO drinks! After I finished ordering 3 more people have came in. One of my drinks was done by the time I ordered, I was just waiting on my other drink. While waiting on my ONE other drink I noticed EVERYONE that has came in AFTER me has ordered and received their drinks. Remind you, when I walked in there was no one and when was standing there waiting on my last drink there again was no one. They stopped my order to make everyone else's order. I then Canceled that last drink. Imagine being the black person waiting on one drink, they stop your order to help all the white people that came in AFTER you and your drink still wasn't ready! Very disrespectful. Maybe the rumor about Starbucks being racist is true.
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Feb 10, 2015~Good neighborhood Starbucks. Better than the one in the Safeway. Doesn't hurt that they mentioned how handsome my son is. :)
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Jun 5, 2017~Close and convenient location to me house. My first visit was this past Saturday 6/3/17 and it could've been better. No one acknowledges that you've entered the store. I stood there for about 3 minutes (on purpose) while they walked back and forth. Then a barista comes to the register and says `"have you been helped`". Hopefully the customer service gets better.
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Aug 11, 2013~The parking is crowded and awkward, but if you are already coming to this location for the bagels at Einstein Bros. next door then I suppose this is a decent Starbucks.  It is small - less than a dozen small tables- and was extremely busy on a Sunday morning.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the drink was made well (which is why I drove an extra mile and a half from the 43rd Ave and Thunderbird location).  The wait in line was over 10 minutes, but my drink was made quickly after I ordered.I can't imagine sitting to study or work at this Starbucks, but I saw at least one person doing so.As a side note, I do not like this new heated pastry thing they are doing.  I kind of like my scones cold or room temp.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Nov 16, 2017~This is my new favorite starbucks. The employees work fast and are just awesome, and super attentive. :v)
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Mar 12, 2018~*My opinion has changed a bit from this review as I have given this establishment another chance in a big way most of the time my order is taken swiftly and processed swiftly BUT my order is not always right as I think they tend to over look some of the details on the printed out order that is on the cups when making the product*.Previous reviewNot happy with this location, I waited for 15 plus minutes for ONE drink as I stood and watched 10+ people come and order there drinks in line and pay NOT pre order on the app or online and they received their drinks all before I did! I am disappointed and wish they wouldn't make up sorry excuses as to how they might have mixed it up it was definitely not that busy and there was more than enough people working at the time very upsetting and never going back and will make recommendations as to that! Pay attention to your orders and your customers! Good luck!

Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Sep 17, 2017~The staff at this Starbucks are very friendly, and they greet me every time I come in. There's been a few times where I've come in and the wait was longer than other Starbucks I've been to. Which is surprising because there's no drive thru to take the baristas' attention away from the customers inside. Overall, it's exactly what you'd expect from any other Starbucks. It's clean and the quality of the drinks is consistent with other locations.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Sep 6, 2019~nice workers and service! we rode here on our horses and everyone was so nice! one of the workers was nice enough to come outside and take a picture of us in front of the store (&amp; was very patient with our none corporative horses) and the worker who made our drinks was super nice as well. we came back in to throw away our trash and he asked how our drinks were and apologized for the wait even though it was super fast service! we sometimes don't have the best service when we ride our horses to get food or drinks but these baristas were awesome! thank y'all!
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~May 18, 2016~When i am on shift and in the area. Love coming here at getting a nice Iced Carmel Frappuccino. Staff is always nice and the store is always clean. And they share a building with Einstein Bagels.
Glendale, AZ 85306~3~Jan 5, 2011~Starbucks is starbucks...it's on my way to work and if i have time i will swing thru hear. Negative is it takes forever because everyone else and their mama seems to go the same time i do. Staff at starbucks are usually always awesome, I would know I've worked at several of em ;)
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Sep 24, 2009~At first blush, this seems like a rather mediocre Starbucks. Two (or is it three) tables in a very small seating area. Look around the side of the building to see some nice outdoor tables, complete with fresh water squirted to cool you down, and it seems a little less average. What really makes this my most frequentest place for a buzz near campus? The amazing staff. Despite working for yet another soulless corporation, they create community and warmth easily bikeable from my apartment and grad school.
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Mar 3, 2013~Attached o the bagel joint. They always seem to have a crowd. Great study spot. Have been to this location since it opened. Staff as changed over the years, but is still rad. Lots of food in the lot. patio is a little rough at times, evil ants in the summer do to the fact that ants are addicted to carmel frappacinos.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Jul 19, 2017~I attend this store every single morning before work but yesterday morning, I had small chunks from the cream in my coffee. Wasn't expecting that and wasn't exactly thrilled.
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Nov 19, 2013~The place is pretty clean but had to wait over  30 min just for a cup of expresso when nobody else is in front of me? Ridiculous!
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~May 31, 2014~Worst service ever. I feel like everyone here has an attitude problem. They don't even greet or thank you. Ugh. I now drive out of my way to avoid this sbux.
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Jul 21, 2014~The store is very clean, and the staff is friendly. But this is the slowest moving Starbucks I have ever been to. Elect to wait around for at least 10 minutes with little to no line.
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Jun 16, 2017~I enjoy coming to this location in the morning and sitting on the shaded patio. The criticism is that the bathrooms and patio are shared with Einsteins and no one seems to maintain them.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~Mar 5, 2017~Every time I go here (for my wife) I leave frustrated and irritated. Never get orders correct and then when you say something they try to tell you they made what you said. And slower than death!
Glendale, AZ 85306~2~Aug 25, 2016~Probably the slowest Starbucks I have been to this year. The people behind the counter only know one speed....SLOW!
Glendale, AZ 85306~5~Apr 7, 2014~I love love love this Starbucks. The staff is quick and always friendly. The drinks are always made perfectly. I have been going to this Starbucks for years. I have also gone to other Starbucks when I had to based on the convenience factor. This is the best Starbucks in phoenix hands down!!!
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Mar 6, 2010~I'm a total Starbucks... hell, coffee junkie! I like that this place is small and not too busy. The parking situation can be a bear sometimes since it shares spaces with Einstein Bagels and Blockbuster, but you can park a little across the way if it was really full so it's not extremely bad. Most of the time Starbucks is Starbucks, however I find that sometimes they don't make the drinks here consistently - at times they'll taste really sweet, sometimes too bitter. I guess it depends on how the barista was trained to make the drink. But as long as I get my coffee it's cool...
Glendale, AZ 85306~4~Jan 18, 2014~The big plus is that this Starbucks is attached to an Einstein's. The customer area is a bit smaller than other Starbucks, but it's got the Starbucks drinks you know and love.
Glendale, AZ 85306~1~May 27, 2014~First time I have ever been to a Starbucks where the service was not friendly. No one made eye contact or even said thank you. I grabbed a snack box that was already opened and realized as I was paying. I informed the cashier and she just grabbed it and threw it and stated `"anything else?`" Then the barista added syrup to my iced coffee after I stated please no sweetener. There was no line and it still took 10 minutes to get a plain grande iced coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Nov 12, 2024~Had to stop off for some Matcha before my visit at Mayo Clinic!  They are friendly and fast!  I got my mini break and off on my way.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 25, 2022~Glad they opened up the indoor ordering. Only using the drive through made it an inconvenience. Staff welcomed with smiles and positive energy. As usual, mornings are packed but lunch time moves fast.Common for breakfast sandwiches to be out of stock during lunch hours. I recommend getting hot drinks for more volume of the drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 21, 2022~SB at a convenient location in a small shopping center at Greenway and 40th st.Staff is very professional, fast and accurate fulfilling orders.I subtract one star for small size, small patio and rundown shopping center.There is a drive thru but watch for pedestrians.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Dec 17, 2021~Stopped in for a quick coffee. Service was good, coffee was hot. Keep seeing lots of product stacked in different Starbuck locations. Perhaps a supply chain thing...
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 26, 2022~Friendly Service at All locations I frequent in Arizona.Baristas are well trained. They know how to create allBeverageS Hot or Cold Starbucks offers. Of you are not satisfied with any beverage, it will be remade at NC. They take 100% Ownership of what they provide That goes for all the food offered each day. The selection is fresh . In 8 years of being a Gold Card Member , I have neverBeen disappointed! Whether I am ordering in Phoenix or Scottsdale, San Francisco, Baltimore or Washington,DC. The Staff follows a precise training that  enables a Barista to be Personable, Responsible and Helpful at all times. The Customer is to leave having had a Great Experience
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 27, 2023~They always close early saying they close at 9 and then they are closed and the barista was so rude and my drink tasted like shit
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Sep 4, 2016~UPDTE:   I always do a mobile order, been doing this since the mobile order came out. Today, I go and wait at the end of the counter. I know the employees are in their grove with making drinks. So I stand and wait for someone to notice me and, I stand and still waiting.... Finally after I continue stare at one of the employees, she finally asks, Can I help you? I state, I have a mobile order, she stated, `" You are just standing there.... Really? I am standing here for a reason. EMPLOYEES, WHEN YOU SEEE A NEW CUSTOMER STAND AT THE END OF THE COUNTER, PLEASE MAKE AN ATEMPT THAT YOU SEE THEM AND SAY, WE WILL BE RIGHT WITH YOU!!!    I have worked in customer service for years, customers are not thrilled when they are not noticed. Fail.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 27, 2014~I have been here 2 times. The staff are friendly and didn't have to wait long for my Carmel frap, my fav! Going to continue to come here.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jan 14, 2018~We stopped through here several times during our stay up the road, usually on the way out of town for a southwestern adventure of some kind.That usually meant that we were going to coming through during rather busy morning hours.The drive through line moves pretty quickly, even when ordering 4 drinks for our one very full car of people. I got familiar Sbux drinks and was happy enough with what I got.S'all good. You'll get your caffeine (or slightly coffee-y sugar bomb beverage...to each their own) and be on your way in no time!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 19, 2021~I ordered a strawberry lemonade and it was super good. the staff was really nice, The person name zeak was super friendly and nice he complimented me on my hair which was awesome! he has the type of personality that employees have at Dutch Bros! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Sep 27, 2016~The staff here are all wonderful, everyone I've encountered is great! I've only ever done mobile orders here and I go somewhat out of my way to make this location the one I call my own. The gentleman who works in the early mornings Trevor,  and Ashley are both great! They are on top of it and always have my drink waiting for me ! Thank you!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 30, 2021~I love this store, they always make your drink great and friendly as can be, BUT the only reason I don't give them.a 5 is the Paper STRAWS they suck. Until we get the plastic straws back I am looking for a new coffee place.This straw is hazardous,  I had it in my coffee &amp; it fell apart, just to let you know the nasty soggy paper is a checking hazard
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Nov 15, 2018~Starbucks is Starbucks and this one is consistent!  I love their app that lets you order ahead and pick up.  This one always has a line, so it's nice to be able to run in and out and have my food already waiting and paid for.  Yes, I said food, not coffee.  Try the sous vide egg white bites.  They're amazing!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 22, 2017~Stuff has no clue for customer service. Want your day ruined stop by. Felt like they doing customers a favor !!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Aug 28, 2021~So I get to the Starbucks Tatum and Greenway or not Tim 40th St. in Greenway and at 7:50 doors locked they close at eight I tap on the window and the barista hold up a finger like a hold on a second so I wait and I knock again she points at her watch on the wrist and says that we're closed go to the drive-through well I drive a large flatbed tow truck that doesn't fit through your drive-through do you know if that's the way you were going to treat your customers who actually tip you how you make extra money and how you can afford to have different things because of people like me they actually leave gratuities I will never visit that store again
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 6, 2021~They're awesome I came here on a Thursday night! Like an asshole customer 7:58 right before closinand they were still super nice and  no attitude !!! Love
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jan 12, 2018~If you've been to one Starbucks, you know the deal with most of them. We stopped here a few times while on vacation, and mostly used the drive thru. It was speedy for for how busy it was, and the barista at the window was flustered, which came out in their customer service, but she was still pretty friendly. I am not really a fan of Starbucks, but this one was A-OK to stop at
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 1, 2021~I said I wanted a Venti white chocolate mocha with soy milk, they did not do that so I asked them to remake it, and they were very rude about it and the manager gave me the worst attitude ever. Definitely not coming back switching my Starbucks location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 24, 2019~Stay away from this Starbucks. I ordered an iced drink through the drive thru which I paid with the Starbucks app. When I handed the cashier (an older gentleman) my phone he seemed bothered and was extremely rude. When he handed me my drink the lid was not closed all the way which made the drink spill all over me and my car. When I asked for napkins the cashier and the barista (a middle aged male) were laughing at the fact that my drink spilled all over my car. This was the first time and last time I visit this Starbucks and I recommend you do the same unless you want your whole day ruined.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 13, 2019~Debbie has built an amazing team here. No matter what time of day I come through every employee is happy and humble and seems eager to help make your experience perfect. I worked here about 3-4 years ago and I truly am amazed at how consistent the atmosphere is throughout these years. My only complaint ever is just how tiny it is. But thats for corporate to change, not on them! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Sep 25, 2019~They always make my coffee on point! The only thing is every time i've gotten the guy who wears glasses mid-late 20's, he is so uninviting. Everyone else usually smiles, is super friendly, actually acknowledges me.. but this guy just always has a stick up his butr, never smiles and i just do not like his attitude.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 8, 2017~This Starbucks it great!!! Best I have ever been to. All the employees are so nice and always have a smile on there face. I have been inside and been through the drive-through. The employees are so quick and efficient. When I have my puppy with me they always ask is he wants a Puppuccino.... which is a real thing guys lol it's just a small cup of whipped cream but they love it!!!!!Now my dog knows when ever we pull up to the drive through he gets so excited and jumps in my lap and puts his paws on the window!!!! He loves this Starbucks just as much as I do!!!! I would highly recommend this Starbucks if you are in the area :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 28, 2019~Service was horrible. Was given the wrong order when I told the girl in the drive thru she gave me attitude as if it was my fault.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 12, 2016~Great service for s smaller Starbucks, off of a busy street. I was helped immediately and had my drink in like 1-2 minutes and this is while they were making drinks for a busy rush hour Drive-Thru. Great staff and customer service with a Gelato place next door, yes.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 21, 2019~I just spent 35 minutes in the drive through waiting for one cup of coffee. I actually turned my engine off. When it was finally my turn at the window I was told the reason for the wait was the employees had to take a phone call. There were four people in front of me, and six in back. The whole drive through came to a standstill because of a phone call. I think the customers standing in front of you should come first. I asked for my coffee to be stirred up and for whipped cream and for it to be hot. The coffee was Not stirred, no whipped cream and it was barely warm. I handed the employee a $10 bill to pay, and he tried to keep my change for himself. I had to ask him to give me my money. I use many locations all over town, and this has never happened before. I highly recommend no one Ever use this location! Shame on you!

Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 18, 2018~Beware if buying someone a gift at Starbucks! My daughter, who lives in another city, bought me a metal water bottle  for my birthday. Since I had just bought myself one, she told me to exchange it for the `"Phoenix`" travel mug I'd wanted. I took in to an in-store Starbucks who told me I couldn't exchange it there because they didn't carry that particular bottle. They sent me to this store who also refused to exchange it. They didn't have that particular bottle, I didn't have a receipt, it was bought 60 days ago (how they knew that I don't know). Excuses, excuses. They would not help me. Their manager was gone. Their acting manager didn't even know how to handle an exchange so I was left totally unhappy. I will never again buy anything from Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~May 14, 2018~I ordered a grande green tea latte with soy iced. It costs about $5 and I had maybe 5 sips it was all foam and had ice all the way up to the cap with barely any room for my actual drink. Once I had two sips and realized it was already half gone I brought it to the attention of the staff and it was handled poorly. I was told it always looks like that and next time to ask for light ice if I want more all of this was said with an attitude from the woman working drive thru with glasses. By the time the young man who had made my drink had offered to remake it I was so irritated I just took my 3 small sips and threw it away and left. Disappointed because Starbucks usually has great customer service.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 15, 2015~This starbucks was super fast and cheerful! I just picked up a drink for my friend who was having a birthday and asked them to write `"Happy Birthday`" on the cup. When I came up to the window the girls had decorated the cup and wrote it in different languages. I'm always so impressed with Starbucks customer service but today definitely was the best I've ever received.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Aug 29, 2019~A nice neighborhood, quick and friendly Starbucks. Never had any orders wrong and have even experienced some awesome pay it forward situations. Staff is super friendly and efficient.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 19, 2018~This is the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. There is no reason to sit in line for 20 min for coffee. Ridiculous
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 2, 2017~Love this Starbucks. Great place to get your coffee. Employees always friendly and always make me feel welcomed. Great spot.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 30, 2014~I go to this Starbucks at LEAST 6 days a week... Mostly through the drive-thru.   I rarely have to wait too long in line, but when I do, I'm pretty sure it's because of a customer.   There are some pretty dumb people out there screwing stuff up..... Anyway, my drink orders are perfect and made perfectly about 98% of the time.  The staff is amazing and remember me and my `"usual`".  I wouldn't know what I would do without them!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 10, 2011~Okay, so I went to this Starbucks on Saturday and ordered my usual café mocha and a breakfast sandwich,the sausage classic.They did not have one so they offered me a spinach-type breakfast sandwich. It was hard as a rock, overcooked, old and I threw it away.I went by today, which is Thursday, ordered my café mocha and the sausage classic sandwich and, once again, it was old, stale, overcooked and hard as a rock. Had to throw it away as well.I called the store and the lady said, `"what do you want us to do for you`"  i said a gift certificate would be nice. Her suggestion was that I drive all the way back to their store to pick it up...Even though I had just said I could not come back to get another sandwich! Ridiculous!!I will not go back!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 29, 2020~I have a absurd amount of chronic illnesses and fat content is something I have to battle constantly. I ordered a fat free smoked butterscotch frappe no whip. My husband even asked if it was made with skim milk when we were handed the beverage... We get to our destination after picking up my drink. Start sipping... Full fat milk... My drink keeps getting made incorrectly if I don't explain that full fat, full serving, can put me in the hospital... If I don't explain it's almost like they think I'm trying to stay `"skinny`" and they do the opposite...ummmm I want to eat and drink all of the rat, not the fat in Monica's fridge, but the bacon cheeseburgers and all of the cheese cake. Starbucks is a deliciousness I can actually partake in when made with nonfat milk. The mix has my Max so if they do it with fat free milk I can be in Nauseas from my tasty in a cup. Anyway, this keeps happening and there is never an apology or a we'll make it right... It's like it's my fault. My fault that customer service no longer exists.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 18, 2019~Never have I had a bad experience at a Starbucks (and I am a very frequent customer but not at this location), this is the first time a barista never said hello or never smiled. In fact, he seemed very annoyed that I had a birthday certificate to redeem. Maybe it was the fact that he had to turn to push some button to redeem a birthday coupon before scanning my phone rather than just scanning away, which he had the scanner readily available in hand. I don't know but he was very rude and I hope he has a better day rather than ruining other people's Starbucks experience.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 8, 2017~Horrible coffee. Ordered the Cold Brew which I've had before at other coffee houses. This one was disgusting, like the cream had spoiled and the coffee was too bitter even for Cold Brew. The girl helping at the window was clueless as well. Not a recommended SB location!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~May 14, 2011~This is my local Starbucks down the street and around the corner near my apartment. This location is very fast....has a friendly staff....and of course the half off Fraps from 3-5 pm are the best deal in town right now. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jan 14, 2014~I do like my Starbucks - I haven't been able to choose a favorite yet although today I tried the Grande Caramel Flan Latte with Soy milk and so far, it's better than the other drinks I have had - hope this one stays around for a while.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 17, 2018~Very frustrating encounter this morning. I have been a regular Starbucks customer for years, but this morning was not pleasant. In the drive thru I ordered my coffee and requested that they not put one of the green plastic stir sticks in my cup. It was a woman that took my order. When I got to the window, before the words could tumble out of my mouth, there was a guy, and he plucked the stick in my cup. I said I had asked for no stick, so unfortunately being that it had already `"touched`" my cup, he promptly said, ok and plucked it out and threw it away. He then said he just automatically puts them in. So frustrating! Starbucks finally came out and said they will phase out straws, but why can't they also ask if you want the extra plastic instead of forcing it on you?! I would think it would save them money as a company too. I am not a crazy person. I just care. We need more people who do to start making a difference!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Aug 18, 2017~I got to this Starbucks every morning on the way to work. I'm always satisfied with the service and my coffee most importantly.  The staff is always friendly and smiling, great way to start off the morning. I'm pretty such they are the fastest Starbucks around, sometimes the line is 10 car links and have my coffee in less that ten min.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Oct 6, 2016~This location tends to be pretty busy in the mornings, but they are fairly quick considering the volume of customers that come through here. Staff is always super friendly and my drinks are always tasty. Definitely my go to location whenever I'm at work.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 8, 2016~One of my favorite Starbucks locations. This amazing team makes my morning each day. Great spot
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 4, 2019~Every time I seem to come to this location which is certainly my last time, all the staff seem to be to hostile and don't even bother to acknowledge if you're waiting to get your order taken, like not even a simple smile or hi when you walk in. The times I've driven through their drive to order a drink they take an eternity to get the drive thru rolling. Also on top of that for some reason when I asked for light ice they seem to put extra ice and my fraps always are horrible when ordered. Take pride and passion in what you do, otherwise don't work there at all.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Aug 24, 2014~I come to this Starbucks at least 2 times a week because its very close to my house and I've been very disappointed every other time I come.  VERY INCONSISTENT. .Sometimes it tastes as it should (rarely) and the other times my frapp is WAY off.. I am a Starbucks junkie I go at least once a day (ones by my job) so I know what my drink is supposed to taste like. .I am not coming back to this location! I will drive one street over &amp; go to the drive thru Starbucks on Bell rd. which has always been consistent in their drinks.. it really makes me upset that I waste almost $6 on a drink I can barely swallow so I Just waste it and pour down the sink.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 1, 2015~I just have to say, Shane is the best!  Jessika is pretty cool too but I feel like I'm at Dutch Bros. with the kind of service Shane gives!  He's so outgoing and friendly, it makes my day every time he's in the drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 24, 2019~Usually great fast service at this location but today my boyfriend and I had a rlly bad experience, I think the worker was named Maxine or Renee but she was skipping multiple peoples mobile orders. She is lucky that both me and my boyfriend are polite because I work in customer service and anytime I mess up I'm always very apologetic! She didn't even acknowledge me or apologize once we got our items. I said `"do u have an order for _____`" and she didn't look at or say anything to me she just mumbled to her coworker and didn't apologize for the slow service once we received our items. Very disappointed because this is my go-to Starbucks. P.S she messed up our refresher which is hard to mess up.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 6, 2019~Worst Starbucks ever girl with the gauges messed up my order I WANTED iced coffee instead she give me a hot drink. Then has this terrible attitude when she has to fix it. And fills the whole thing up with ice with barely any coffee. Not to mention I waited in line for 30 min. Just bad worst service I've ever had at any Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jul 7, 2018~This location is incredibly slow and has poor service. We spent 10 minutes in the drive through with 2 people ahead of us. Our order was wrong which we discovered after diving away. $4 drink could not be consumed after that wait. The staff at the window were not friendly. Starbucks usually has much better customer service than this. I will not return to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 14, 2015~Thank you to everyone at this store! I love being able to cross the street and be able to see everyone smiling and happy to be there. Shoutout to Shane for making my white chocolate mocha perfect every time! :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Mar 10, 2013~This location rocks. Consistently great service/coffee. This is not the closest Starbucks to my house but is officially my Starbucks. Whether I go in or order through the drive-through they give me my coffee fix. Great job!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Apr 14, 2017~Coffee and employees good. As expected. But bathroom hasn't been cleaned in months. It's not just that there is paper all over the floor but there are disgusting greasy grimey smears on the paper towel dispenser. Floors have months of grime like a gas station bathroom.  Restaurant owners have told me that if you want to see whether a restaurant kitchen is clean, check how clean the bathroom is. Nuff said
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jul 23, 2015~Nice Starbucks.  Always friendly service and pretty quick.  I usually stop here when I'm dropping my laundry off.  Can't complain, solid location and great coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~May 22, 2018~Waited 22 minutes for a tall vanilla latte from the time I ordered until the time my drink came. And they were not even crowded.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 21, 2015~This is a great Starbucks! They're very friendly and they really care about the customers. I bring my 4 year old daughter with me and they're so great at building a rapport with her :) Shout out to Shane and Kris for being so awesome!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 6, 2011~Okay so we all know what to expect from Starbucks. The selection is the same. So what it really comes down to is the staff. And this location happens to have superb staff. I always end up leaving this place with a smile on my face, regardless if I'm having a grumpy, frumpy morning. I'm sure the fact that I'm leaving with a giant cup of caffeine helps with that... but the people working the drive-thru are always quick with a smile and laugh, and seem to genuinely want to spread those smiles to the customer.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 18, 2011~I love the Vanilla Latte and I made up my own drink, i get regular latte and have them put peppermint syrup in it, it is so delicious....one barista couldnt belive i dont also put chocolate in it but it doesnt need it, its just wonderful and perfect just like that. mmmmm makes me want to go get one now....
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 5, 2015~My all time favorite Starbucks location. I drive out of my way for the cheerful staff and a good cup of coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 27, 2018~I just want to make it clear, before I keep moving forward with this review, the cashier, Taylor, was sweet and did her job just fine, but as for the manager or lead who was overseeing the shift (Tuesday, February 27th at 10 am), I have a bone to pick with you - and my apologies for not catching your name. As a person of the younger generation, I constantly hear about how we're `"lazy and entitled`", well, glass breaker for the older generations - you LACK compassion to the point where you radiate negativity, cause anxiety, and have someone voice their experience of your behavior and give you a bad review for your `"business`". There is more in this world than just `"business`" - there's a bigger picture, it's called Life. If I want to buy some food for someone clearly living in poverty, who has armfulls of plastic bags they've accumulated from off of the streets due to other's negligence, a hat made from ripped paper bags and tape, and looks like they could use a shower - let me do it, in peace. Do not approach them and tell them they can not be there just because they look different on the outside. They were going to pay for food but didn't have enough for all the things they wanted. So of course I stepped up. What you COULD have done was approach BOTH of us, thanked me for taking care of another human being rather than alienating them and assure both of us that our patronage was appreciated. You catch more flies with honey than vinegar. Ms. Manager/Lead, I don't care what your religion is, I don't care how much you volunteer outside of work, I don't care about your charity contributions - your public behavior was disrespectful to TWO human beings all for the sake of `"business`". You completely disregarded me, and attacked the idler. What happened to 'paying it forward'? What happened to taking care of each other? What happened to just being nice? Or is that only around the Holidays? As a human, I'm sick of the lack of compassion for 10 months out of the year, and two months of false-giving. GIVE ALL THE TIME. You can't take your wealth with you. Share it. Please let this be a lesson that all ears are listening, all eyes are watching, and I hope when I grow older, my heart doesn't shrink like yours clearly has. I understand you do have a `"business`" to run, but c'on, cut against the grain once in a while and be respectful to all unless they clearly do not deserve it. Being a bum doesn't mean you treat them with disrespect. You don't know what battles they're fighting.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 24, 2017~To start off I love Starbucks, and I'm an avid customer to multiple locations. This particular location has continued to be a disappointment. Every time I come here the girls are rude, they have no customer skills whatsoever, and they are too consumed talking amongst each other to actually pay attention to anything. I don't need someone to be overly gushing and asking about how I am or blah blah but some decency and a kind tone would be nice. The 4-5 times I've been there they've messed up my drink 3 of the times and they have never once apologized. I don't find my drink that complicated, it's a green tea lemonade, sweetened with no ice. It's heart breaking for me because it makes me not want to ever go to this location because it's so close to my work and convenient for me to go to, but they frankly kind of suck. I'm shocked that a Starbucks would be allowed to be run in such a manor, and I'm disappointed. I really hope they change their attitudes and learn some customer service. I won't be going back anytime soon.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 12, 2012~Got a white mocha frappaccino with caramel sauce blended in with an espresso shot!  It was amazing!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 21, 2012~It is always a delightful experience every time I come here. They have never messed up my drink before and everyone is always in a perky mood. They have exceptional customer service and you can tell they love their jobs. If your lucky enough to go when Allyson is working, she will always make you smile. I seem to always get her to ring me up, and I have to say she makes it more than a coffee shop, she creates a delightful `"Experience`". Well done 40th and greenway!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Apr 15, 2017~Spot on most of the time, although sometimes you ask a question about a certain product and you can tell the answer was pulled out of thin air. Brush up on the knowledge of your inventory and this location is set.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 16, 2014~This is the only drive-thru location on my way to work and it is usually pretty busy but they seem to get us through quickly (haven't been late yet!). They are always friendly and quick. Only once did I notice my drink wasn't quite sweet enough but I am kind of a sugar-holic when it comes to coffee. Maybe they were trying to do my pancreas a favor.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 7, 2015~I have been going to this Starbucks constantly because it's close to my house,  but it's become to a state that I need to find another location. The taste of the coffee is not great,  not what's supposed to taste like.  I can't say that the staff is very friendly either.  The place is becoming dirtier and dirtier every time I go.  I decide to let everyone know that I saw a staff removing the trash bag out of the can.  As she was doing that,  she placed the trash lid on top of the cart were sugar and milk sit. LADY,  that's where I put down my coffee,  place my coffee lid down so I can get some sugar and creamer! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? I couldn't believe it,  honestly!!!  Incredible!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 23, 2015~I go to this Starbucks at least 3 times a week, and Jim and my girls Taylor and Melody always take care of me! These girls are great. I don't go anywhere else. Everyone knows me by name and knows exactly how I like my drink. Exceptional customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Dec 21, 2014~I go this Starbucks at least 3 times a week, and Jim and my girls Taylor and Melody always take care of me! These girls are great. I don't go anywhere else. Everyone knows me by name and knows exactly how I like my drink. Exceptional customer service!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jan 28, 2014~I go to this starbucks VERY often.  Most of the time the coffee is perfect. But everytime, the service is amazinf
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 10, 2012~My store. They  know me, I know them. They treat me right. I go through sometimes to buy something as a treat for someone else and I say- make it beautiful it's a gift and they do! Awesome!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 19, 2016~I call this my home Starbucks, the staff is always friendly, helpful for me to start my day! Laura Lucas is the shining star employee that always makes my drinks......
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 23, 2016~I just popped in to get a gift card and on my way out the really sweet employee offered me a water for the road since its 110 degrees. I just thought that was so thoughtful! Well done, Starbucks
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Aug 3, 2016~Every time I visit this Starbucks I get a different experience and usually not the best. The staff is very friendly but the drinks are inconsistently made day to day. I could get a caramel macchiato one day and have it made completely differently the next. I've also had several drinks made that the cup wasn't full (and I'm talking there was almost a half of the cup not full). When I pay $7 for a coffee...I'd expect it to be full lol.  All in all, this Starbucks is one of my last choices to visit and I only do if I am in a pinch for time.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jan 26, 2014~Today I just didn't like the chai tea latte...tasted watered down...didn't even drink half if it had to throw it out, just tasted gross
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jan 23, 2016~Eva was SO rude to me. She acted annoyed when I asked her a question about one of the drinks and I didn't understand why until after I paid. I offered her a coupon for my local business to help cheer her up. She told me `"no, tha business sucks. I used to work there and it is crap.`" Of course I'm advertising my business on my shirt, so now I understand why she was rude to me in the beginning. I told her `"wow... That was really rude. I don't agree with you.`" And she just shrugged and later slammed my drink down almost spilling it.   No idea who she is, but that was so unprofessional. Not going back unless she is gone. Can't believe any company would allow a person like that to work for them.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 27, 2013~The new reduced fat turkey bacon sandwich is TERRIBLE.  Why did you mess with a great thing?  The original with the whole wheat english muffin, egg whites and turkey bacon was so good.  I will never buy the new one again.....and probably will never buy any food items at Starbucks again.  Terrible.  Disappointing.  To add insult to injury, my husband's Veggie Egg sandwich was hard as a rock when we got home.  What a waste of money!  Pay attention to details and understand what your client's want.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jun 23, 2014~Slowing starbucks I have ever been to. Avoid the drive thru at all costs...unless you have a good 10 min. to wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~4~Jun 26, 2024~The service here is always quick, the drinks are made accurately and food is good in a pinch if you need a quick snack or last minute breakfast. This one is more of a quick grab and go location. There is no dining room or lobby to sit and enjoy your coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 23, 2023~This place is drive thru only as their cafe is closed indefinitely. What was extremely disappointing was that all the items I wanted were not available. I ended up ordering something else and what I had was okay, but I would much prefer going to an establishment that actually has their menu items in stock.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 24, 2024~I absolutely hate this Starbucks and try to avoid it at all costs, however it is in the parking lot where I work. It's extremely convenient for me to go to this one since I'm already in the parking lot but tell me how you are never accepting cash?? I show up at this Starbucks between 5:30 and 6:30 and you're not accepting cash?? You're still open that makes absolutely no sense. On top of never accepting cash the staff is rude every time that I go there
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Nov 1, 2023~Zero sense of urgency. There was one other person in front of me in store and it took 15 mins for an iced chai and water. The drive thru is the only thing open on weekends it seems. This location could use a much needed refresh unfortunately. Store is very dirty.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Oct 21, 2023~It is my birthday and I wanted my birthday drink but then I see that the door is locked and it is only 6:40 and they close at 7 if you close at 6:40 please say that on your website!!!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Nov 10, 2023~Don't come to this Starbucks, wait times are 25+ minutes long during non peak times. Got to the register after placing my mobile order ahead of time and the cashier had me repeat my order twice.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 19, 2023~Been to this location and few times and have always had a good experience. Went to the drive thru on 8/19 around 3 PM to order a frozen lemonade that was made incorrectly at another location. The male brown-haired barista working in the drive thru was so nice and he apologized even though he didn't make the first drink, and comped my order. Thank you!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Oct 28, 2021~I was doing a several mile walk to Luke AFB for an event, so I had a chance to try out this SB. I am an SB fan usually giving 4-5 stars but have to give three for this one. I understand they have a junkie, riff raff issue(however I didn't encounter any)but their lesser services as a result detracts from my Starbucks enjoyment.First, there was zero seating available inside or even outside. Second, there's no toilet. Note: After walking 5 miles and taking a short break to walk another 7 miles, I like to SIT DOWN while enjoying my caffeine boost.Third, it's the smallest Starbucks I've ever been in.Staff was ok.Not recommended SB.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 16, 2023~I'm not completely sold on Starbucks but every now and then I decide to give it a try. Do not go to this location unless you're desperate I realize this isn't the best side of town. I'm assuming that's why there's no tables or chairs outside anymore. But the lobby is closed at 1:30 PM on a Saturday. There are only 6 vehicles in front of Me, I have been sitting in line for over 20mins. Having only the drive thru open you would think the associates would have a pretty good system going allowing for the line of cars to stay @ a good flow. I have seen @ least 4 people that are unable to go thru the drive thru try to go inside. I felt bad for the elderly women with a walker that made her way to the door only to find out it was locked. I thought Starbucks was supposed to be a place you could go to relax or meet people for coffee, etc. NOT THIS LOCATION. I am exhausted from working early morning &amp; just wanted to pick me up. I could've definitely taken a nap in the drive-through not to pick me up I was looking for. Again, try to go to any other location if you dare want to try Starbucks. I Have written is review and I'm still waiting for my coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Aug 2, 2023~I can see why this store has a low rating.  I went to this store AGAIN (I don't know why) last Saturday evening and bought a matcha latte and asked for light ice.  Again, my cup was full of ice.  If I'm paying over $7 for a Starbucks drink why is it so hard to put light ice in my cup.  Hell, I'll even pay an exta $.50 cents for this store to get my order right.  I usually frequent 3 different stores and this by far is the most frustrating to go to.  I won't be going to this store anymore.  I mean in the long run Starbucks will still make money regardless if I go to this store or not, but I recommend if you want your drink made correctly you go somewhere else.   Store 5469- You guys have it all wrong.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Jul 19, 2023~When Starbucks employees make a drink, do they read the sticker on the cup? I asked for light ice this morning, and when the employee was handing me my drink, I noticed the cup was full of ice. I politely stated that I asked for light ice. Whoa, did I catch an attitude. I then asked for Splenda and got the same response.  Not sure how any of this was my fault. If I'm paying almost $6 for coffee, I don't think asking for and receiving light ice is asking a lot.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jul 8, 2022~My favorite Starbucks for years. Love the staff,the drinks,their foods are great. I also love their desserts,especially;the lemon cake,amazing.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Mar 26, 2021~My favorite location for years. Johnny the manager, is great,Isaac is also great, as well as Sabrina  &amp; the rest of  the staff.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Oct 7, 2020~A great staff:Jonny,Isaac,Selena,Devon are awesome. They go above and beyond. Amazing workers &amp; staff
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 2, 2016~Too many transients hanging inside &amp; out.No one Does anything, they sleep at night on tables &amp; do other things. They come in use the bathrooms. They threaten people.Tables should be put in, also people smoke outside there, will not go anymore
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Oct 15, 2016~Awful place, the seating is awful.Transients hang out there constantly all the time &amp; sleep outside on patio tables.  It is awful.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Nov 17, 2023~This drive thru takes so long! They lady couldn't do math either , please hire new people. I love Starbucks but this store puts it to shame
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Dec 26, 2022~I love how people think that Starbucks staff is supposed to do something about `"vagrants`" standing outside the store. What else would you expect from people who pay $8.00 for coffee?I know that they aren't responsible for who's walking outside the store, or inside for that matter. I did have a problem with the manager. Really terrible attitude. Kind of a `"I'm not here to serve you`" and `"Keep it brief`" type. I've just walked away from conversations with him on multiple occasions. Other than that, I'm not crazy about them not having outdoor seating because of the homeless people. Who cares if they sit in their metal chairs for a minute? It's not a neighborhood of homeless people. What about serving the people who come into your store and making our experience like everyone else's?In a Tempe Starbucks I lived by, it was 1/2 homeless and 1/2 people with jobs on laptops, etc. and they still have a whole seating area. The world didn't collapse. It's a bias to the area, not a concern for a potential problem.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Oct 21, 2023~I have never been more disgusted  with humanity as I held my 3 year old grandson that was about to soil himself would be denied a toilet and told us to `"go to El polo loco due to they allow their toilets to be used. There employees are capable of serving the public`".  Goodbye Starbucks. You will never see another penny from us.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Oct 3, 2023~Went to Starbucks this morning to grab a drink and ended up being followed.  The whole staff was amazing especially Alex upfront.  He made sure we were okay and kindly got the guy to leave.  Definitely was a scary morning but felt so comfortable being there.  Will definitely be going back there despite the situation.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jan 8, 2023~I go to Starbucks all the time but I've never been to this location. I just left and the customer service was just outstanding. And the drinks were the best I've had in weeks! Idk the girls name who was working the window but she was just so sweet and super quick. Thank you!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~4~Aug 15, 2020~We ordered mobile once we got to the store. The set up is pretty good and it seemed like drive thru was going pretty quickly. Our mobile order has 8 items and was done early, which was awesome. No outdoor seating set up and you can't order inside currently.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 3, 2023~I don't know why this store has so many bad reviews. The workers are all very friendly, sweet, and remember me. Despite it always being busy, they quickly get things done. Once, I was stuck behind someone in the drive through for about 30 minutes because the customer was unhappy and wanted things remade but the staff handled it well and even gave me my drink for free. I think its a great store and very good staff :)
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Jul 3, 2021~This place would be rated higher if the location was half as efficient as the other Starbucks locations in the area. I've had several instances of ordering an item through the app only to arrive and be told it is sold out. Whether this is down to the app not tracking inventory in real-time like it claims, or some other reason I can't say for sure. I can accept and understand that things happen, but not receiving any kind of notice prior to arrival is kind of annoying.While rare, I have experienced issues with the location closing the inside facility early a couple of times and routing everyone through the drive-thru--That doesn't really work when you walk to the shop because it's just around the corner. That's only happened to me twice, but seems to have happened to other people too.The staff have always been very friendly and polite when I come in. Whether it's just a greeting and giving me my order, or offering solutions when something has been over-sold, and even the occasional employee recommendation to try new stuff on the menu, I've never had a bad experience with the team at this store. The drive-thru is always packed, and they are always very busy, so the fact that they can keep their cool and treat their customers so well is a credit to them all.It's hard to review a coffee shop fairly as we are slowly recovering from a global pandemic, because several of the amenities such as eating indoors, listening to music, or even having sufficient quantities of items are either significantly hampered or outright impossible at the moment. I suspect that, as we get closer to how things used to be, this location may gain a star.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~May 22, 2022~Every time I come here, my drink is always wrong. Today I got a cafe vanilla Frappuccino with caramel and it didn't have any vanilla bean powder in it. Drink still tasted good, but it wasn't what I ordered. What I got was a coffee frapp with caramel, which is cheaper so it just sucks I paid more for a less product.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Apr 30, 2023~Took over 20 minutes to get 1 drink 20 minutes prior closing and the baristas were more concerned about trying to close early than actually making peoples drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 7, 2023~First off , i have never had to write a complaint and i never have on any company because i understand things happen. however, i sat at a empty drive through today for about 5+ minutes. pulled up to the window and sat there for about another 5-8 minutes. again if there was a line and they were handling a lot of orders i get it but there were 4 employees there doing nothing. when i got my drink it was wrong (they gave me sweet cream foam and it was supposed to be just vanilla sweet cream) so the girl took it back and all they did was mix the foam into my drink! at this point im already annoyed and just left.  ive NEVER experienced such laziness from any starbucks ive been to like this. a long wait when there is NO ONE in the drive through or IN THERE STORE and couldnt even FIX MY drink right?! come on man.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 1, 2018~Ive been to a lot of Starbucks' and out of all I would definitely have I say this location was my favorite. I'm not from Arizona but was staying a week in Phoenix and made this location my go to for daily drinks.The employees here great you with a smile which doesn't happen back home in NYC and this location is cleaner than most. However, I would have to agree with what other posters have mentioned about the homeless issue. The tweakers/homeless hangout on the outside patio area and hassle people for change upon exiting the store. I'm used to this but others may not be. This might actually be a problem that's out of Starbucks' control and rather a bigger problem that exists in Arizona.My actual drinks were standard for Starbucks and hit the mark each time I ordered.Beyond that this location is great and I'd suggest you try it out!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jun 12, 2021~I always drive through at this location on my way to the gym. They make a good salted caramel cold brew. Shout out to Daphne who is at the window now she is gorgeous and super friendly !! Starbucks she's a keeper !
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Oct 22, 2021~Wow the management is so much better than the previous months I've been here! Literally got the best service today. I can't explain how grateful I am for the understanding and love the management was! Life changing experience
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Jul 21, 2022~I don't have problem with their drinks because it's good. However, your doors are closed during business hours and you have a sign saying mobile order and drive through. Ok, I did the mobile order and drove here to see the door closed? So what's the point of the mobile order if I have to be in the drive through? Change your business hours on google that way people know it's CLOSED!!!!! I just saw 4 different people were trying to come in and the doors were closed.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jan 26, 2022~Awesome Customer Service ! Driver thru only location .. thanks ladies for the White Mocha :)
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 26, 2022~Update: I took this post down because I felt like it needed edits. Turns out, I still hate this location and it still is `"understaffed`" and `"drive through only`" a year later. The post below was originally written 2021. Whew. Where do we begin? I recently moved to the north-central phx area. I've been here about a year, going on two now. As a consumer, as well as a former `"partner.`" I do feel this post is necessary. I waited awhile to launch any type of formal complaint against this particular location because I like to be as cooperative and understanding as possible, especially during these trying times. On 11/28, I made a phone call during off peak hours to see if management had a minute to discuss general feedback. I spoke with V who is a self proclaimed `"newer addition`" to the team, but still a manager. V informed me that she would be seeing the general manager tomorrow and would promptly inform him of our discussion that outlined a series of unfortunate events: such as the time where this particular location decided to just close in the middle of the day due to staffing issues. No official notice, just a plain piece of paper on the front door with a half-felt `"sorry`" written in pen. Furthermore, I do frequent this location during various hours, which include off and on peak time. No matter what time of day, plan an additional 10 minutes on top of the 15-30 you already set aside in your routine just because lines are always long, there seems to be only 1-2 people working, and the lobby closes around 5. Oh, and if it gets really busy, I guess it's policy just turn off the option to mobile order ahead. I further discussed with V about how being a previous partner. Sometimes I feel the urge to just put on an apron and make my own beverage or even just offer help. V informed me that she would absolutely talk to her boss when she saw him the next morning to further follow up after asking for my name and phone number. I waited for a phone call and didn't really expect one in the morning hours, because again, peak hours. But I finally decided to call the store this afternoon after lunch and ask for the GM myself, R***. I spoke briefly with R*** and asked if by chance V had mentioned anything about our previous conversation. He replied, `"No?`" Surprise. So I asked if he had minute to discuss some general feedback. I illustrated everything already in this post, as well as my previous discussion with V. The whole point of this conversation was for me to gain insight as a consumer as to why this location in particular always seems to be driving the struggle bus, even after a full blown `"renovation.`" Not just for myself, but to also inform others in my circle who have had similar experiences. During my conversation with R***. I mentioned how I was a former partner at Starbucks. For the record, I have also managed other coffee shops. Yet, I still just don't see why this store runs like a three legged cat. Moreover, how I would offer my services but I don't know what I'm actually up against (i.e the alleged high turnover rate and why that i). Obviously there's a common denominator that I guess is non-public info. R*** responded to my feedback with `"right now we're really just trying to do our best, manifest positive vibes, and make moments.`" Which at this point I knew the conversation was over because never in any type of training has it been suggested that one can `"manifest`" that a store will run itself. Shop local.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Sep 6, 2019~American equivalent of Indian udupi kaapi :-) I still remember the first time I had a coffee in a Starbucks outlet back in India...ppl would get into line for hours to have one Starbucks coffee...but here a Starbucks is very common place for a quiet sip of coffee .you can find children working on some assignment and people having coffee and cookies crunching .I love this outlet a lot and their beverages are really good .it's not as overpriced as back in India and definitely worth a try
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 5, 2022~These folks are so rude! I get your located in a bad neighborhood, but don't make us patrons suffer. At least have it locked if needed for paying customers! This is ridiculous.... there is no need to be rude to your customers that are paying for coffee. Refund me since you don't care about your customers!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jul 10, 2019~Please take this as constructive criticism. For two weeks straight, 10 days in a row, I order your nitro cold brew. Not because I thoroughly enjoy it, but because your regular cold brew is pretty much just water. Sadly, you're the only Starbucks near my home, so I hadn't complained until now. For 10 straight days, several different window employees, I ask for many pumps of classic and milk in my nitro brews and I always get the drink without milk and without classic. Now, I have to taste the drink once handed to me to ensure I get what I ordered, and without fail, it's not. Do you own up to your mistakes? Of course not, your employees always give me attitude and give me this awkward stare as I explain to them what's missing in my drink. This mistake causes your employees, myself, and the long line of cars behind me to waste more time, as you `"fix`" my order. I placed fix under quotation marks, because it's just bearable to drink and I need to wake up.So...who's fault is it? Management. This is a training issue on two fronts: 1) Customer service and 2) Standards of production (essentially how to make coffee). Please use this review to better your practices and I will make a revision in due time.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Apr 6, 2019~Excellent Starbucks. They were out of my normal Green tea latte (at least that is what the app told me) I ordered something else and a tall dark roast for my friend. When I got inside they told me they didn't have dark roast right now but she offered to add a shot to pike roast for me and it was amazing. I really appreciate the staff was very friendly and helpful and now we have a new drink that is delicious!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Apr 23, 2017~5 Stars for SUPERB customer service. Justin was working the drive-thru window yesterday when we gave him a huge order. He got it right but what amazed my fam and I is how attentive and professionally courteous he was. Seriously, no joke, his customer service was THE best I've ever encountered. He should be an executive at some resort because that's how great he was. Definitely worthy of a promotion. Thanks for making our day!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 25, 2022~This Starbucks is very clean and they care about their customers.  I went through the drive thru and got a Mango Dragon fruit refresher told them I have breast cancer got up to window and there was no charge. Touched my heart. Thank you kind Starbucks love your company only place I get my drinks you deserve a Pat on back will be back.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 18, 2021~Sandra helped me in the drive thru today and I just want to say she was so pleasant and cheerful it was pretty busy but didn't seem to effect her at all, definitely love when there is this kind of customer service around still! Will definitely keep coming to this Starbucks, keep up the awesome job!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Mar 9, 2021~Today I made a mobile order and came through the drive through and let me just say the workers were so rude. Went I came through they sounded disgusted that I was in their space and when I got my drink they did not include the whip cream that I ordered on top. So I asked kindly if I could get that included, since I put it in my order, and the guy took my drink, rolled his eyes, said something under his breath, and grudgingly returned with the drink. I understand everyone has a tough day but in customer service you have to keep going. Sad to say this location was really a disappointment and won't be coming back.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Mar 9, 2021~I've been to this location multiple times and let me say it's the croissants and NICOLE ! Nicole always a vibrant smiling voice behind the mic and mask! Her spirit radiates with every order she places! There's mornings where she's not prepared for success when the menu is updated with new drinks but the ingredients haven't come in yet, but she pushes threw lol she will always always explain and help create or find something similar. It's very rare that I've ever felt included at this establishment or had a joyful experience but as long as croissants and Nicole are at this location I will forever be a customer. Nicole, thank you for being the light during some of the darkest days!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Sep 25, 2019~These guys are probably the best employees of Starbucks I have come face to face with. Some not the best but I give high five for the ones who care about getting our drinks made right. Thank you to Miriam, Michelle, Andrea our night shift crew. For the mistake of an employee I got a free drink and was able to pay for someone's meal who waited patiently. Thank you for our good doing so I can do my good doing.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 30, 2020~STORE MANAGER TALKS SH**I have been to this starbucks about 1-3 times a week for 8 months. Half the time they get my drink right depending on the people working and if they know me but that's never enough for me to write a bad review. I order my usual, an iced coffee with caramel drizzle in it. Since the environmentally friendly lids came along, I try to drink my coffee but the caramel just sits at the bottom and I can't taste it at all so I like to use a straw. I ask `"hey sorry but can I get a straw`" I get a dumbfounded look and for a minute I didn't think he was going to give me one. Then as i'm waiting he finally scoffs and says `"God, I swear you arizonans don't like saving the turtles`" I was speechless and wanted to make comments like `"you know recycling exists`" but nothing would come out. I took my straw and he scoffs again saying have a good day and shuts the window. This was totally unlike this starbucks and coming from him because I know he's the store manager but I've had enough of this place. Again half the time the drinks are wrong or I get priced differently depending on workers and now attitude?
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jun 22, 2021~Kevin and Isaac are literally the backbone of this location, they are always so friendly, and I wouldn't come back if it wasn't for them. I come through this drive through 2-3 times a week, and they get ish done. Fastest drive through line ever. Favorite Starbucks ever.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 24, 2018~This place was busy as usual. No matter when I go the baristas are always nice and friendly, usually having good conversation with me. My order is alway done right. When I order I go and wait at an empty table for my name to be called, instead of waiting at the hand off area.  An iced coffee spilled and they barely moved out of the way for the guy cleaning up. They replaced the spilled on food without any one asking for it to be replaced. I go to the art studio across the across the street, going to starbucks before doing my art is alway my favorite.  I usually bring my own cup and they never forget my cup discount (which honestly is not a big, but it's nice to get). Keep it up baristas, good job.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~May 20, 2022~This is my favorite Starbucks cause all drinks are made very good and it's on my way to work,  but there's this one person (keven)  that always looks and sounds like he's in a bad mood!  I Always say please and thank you and he never says anything back. Just hands me the drink with an attitude and shuts the window!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Dec 20, 2018~Well damn I know why the 2.5 stars . Yeah the customer service I got today from Josh was not the best . He sure gave the person in front of me and the guy behind me great service. Looks like this Starbucks lost my money .
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Apr 2, 2022~Cici was so nice! This is my first time to this location and she was the best Starbucks employee I've met.... And I go to Starbucks everyday!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 21, 2018~I am so disappointed in this Starbucks. I took my 4 year old son to the bathroom and we were in there for all of 2 minutes. We mistakenly went into the men's bathroom but it was for my son so technically it was still the correct bathroom for him. While he's on the toilet we get a loud banging on the door from an employee saying to open up the door. I said loudly that it was busy but the employee replied `"well we have someone waiting out here!`" Then I shouted back that my son was still using the bathroom. When we exited, there was an angry customer waiting to walk right in. It seems Starbucks as a whole has an issue with their bathrooms and clearly they didn't learn anything from the day they took off in May. There was nothing wrong with my son using the single Men's bathroom. Get it together Starbucks!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 14, 2022~This Starbucks is close to my house but went there for the first (and last time) a few days ago. There were about 7 cars in the drive they before me, but it seemed to move quickly. The weather is nice so with my windows down I proceeded to the drive up with a friend to place my order- that's when the bees started swarming around my car. I was speaking into the microphone when they began to come in my window!!  I said oh my Gosh! There are bees coming in my car as I quickly rolled the window up and the employee on the other end said  `"I know, but their friendly bees!`" It took me several minutes to place the order as I had to keep rolling my window up and down continuously so I didn't get stung and  have bees in my car (my small Shitzu was with me as well, and she was not liking the bees much to say the least). As I VERY SLOWLY made my way to the window, with my windows up, I discovered as soon as I tried to hand over my phone (I have the Starbucks app) for her to scan (she had the scanner in her hand) that the bees were worse there!!  I had to practically throw my phone so I could pay and not be stung as I could not leave that window down for more than 1/2 second and only a crack,  it was impossible to get my drink because the bees were everywhere and trying to get in my car, sting me, and gene really just swarm all around the window.  showing her annoyance with me, the Starbucks employee suggested while throwing my phone back to me, that I just pull up to the front of the store. With still no drink yet, I  pulled up, incredulous that this was even happening!  I sat in my car waiting for someone to come out and bring me my coffee and after close to 10 minutes I realized that no one was coming! Livid,I went inside, saw the same girl taking orders  as though she had completely forgotten about me; livid and yelling over everyone standing there I yelled `"excuse me! You might have told me that I had to come inside to get my order rather than have me sit outside waiting!`" She looked up and told me that I hadn't paid!! I reminded her that I had handed her my phone to scan; and she had  the scanner, why had she not done the scan??  I stormed back to my car to get my wallet and pay and get the heck out of there, when another employee came out with my drink. I was livid and proceeded to tell her that this was the worst Starbucks experience ever  and she (wisely) chose to do the only positive customer service display I had experienced in the grueling 30 minutes i had spent there!  I won't ever return, free drink or not - absolutely horrible!! Starbucks  doesn't want to be associated with this location.  And watch out for the bees!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Jun 13, 2018~Good location and drinks....unclean restrooms!!!Nothing turns me off than messy and unclean restrooms!! Makes you wonder how clean the rest of the business is kept.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Feb 23, 2020~I've never had such great customer service as I did this morning, both the drive thru attendant and Kevin at the check out were great! I go to Starbucks everyday and this has been the first time in a long time that I was provided with excellent customer service! Thank you Kevin and the other gentleman who took my drink order!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Aug 28, 2017~Although chains like Starbucks should, in theory, exhibit comparable service and quality, this was not my experience today.I ordered a vanilla sweet cream coldbrew. It was okay. Not great, but it would get the job done. I would have given it 3 stars had it not been for the Barista.  Maybe he was just having a bad day, but I was surprised at just how unfriendly he managed to be during our very brief interaction. While the woman who took my order was perfectly nice, the kid working the drive-thru cash register seemed genuinely inconvenienced customers were there at all. I get it, some days maybe you just don't feel like coming into work and dealing with people, but you don't need to take it out on customers. I would think twice before returning to this location.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Mar 12, 2017~Waking in to the Starbucks there was no line which was awesome. Had to use the restroom and it was a big surprise. This has have to be the dirtiest Starbucks I have ever been too. The bathroom had some stuff all over the sink that looked like throw up but I wasn't sure nor was I going to find out. We got our drinks and sat at a table but we had to clean it. Unfortunately there were no napkins on the table and it seemed like the trash has not been thrown out for hours. Everything was over filling. The people working were very nice and the drinks were good but because of how dirty this Starbucks actually is I don't think I will be coming back because I'm not sure how clean they keep the actual machines.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Sep 24, 2021~This location closes whenever it wants to. Whether that be in store, drive thru or both. I know this seems petty but at the very least the app should notify if that is the case. This location is on my way to work and I always do a mobile order and pick up inside so that I can get to work on time. When it is randomly closed, and I already have paid for my items it puts me in a very frustrating position. I'm not going to speak on quality bc it is hit or miss just like every Starbucks, I don't find the employees very friendly. Again like most locations. But the inconsistency in the stores availability randomly without warning is not right. I tried to call the store no one answers. I know my business or my lack of business makes no difference to anyone but honestly unless you are doing nothing for the day but getting Starbucks, go somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Jun 11, 2019~Again another Starbucks that the employees and owners don't care about cleanliness.  This place was a mess.  The bathroom hadn't been cleaned in awhile. You didn't want to touch anything worried you pick up some kind of virus.  Order a simple cold brew with sweet cream and it took them 15min to make it while everyone that ordered behind me (hot drinks and cold) got theirs before me.  I am a pretty patient person but when someone gets backed up you'd think the people standing around talking would help out especially if the person getting behind is new.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jan 28, 2017~Staff was awful. Slow service and mean to customers, wrong drink orders.I waited for my drink for over 25 minutes but was too scared to ask about it because a lady in front of me very politely asked about a drink she had been waiting for for 20 minutes and got yelled at, pretty badly by what seemed to be a supervisor. Just go to a different location!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Nov 30, 2019~The guy taking orders kept repeating how stressed out he was and complaining about other emoyees asking him questions while he was working....`"Hey in case you did know... You work at Starbucks which is a very busy coffee place.`"Dont complain about your job while you work.  If you cant handle it, work somewhere else.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~3~Aug 25, 2016~Sorry to say that this location has declined appreciably since my last review. Customer service is very hit &amp; miss. Cleanliness has deteriorated.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jun 2, 2016~Brand new location. Replaced the old location in the Albertson's shopping center at 19th Ave &amp; Northern. Good parking, easy access and drive thru. Customer service was good, but most are at the beginning. Will have to see how things progress with time, but for now, A okay.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Mar 23, 2020~If it was to me I would rate this experience ZERO STARS. The employee who took my order not only treated me very poorly, he didn't say hi when I walked up to the window, instead he said `"here, here, here`" with bad attitude while handing me the drink and through all of this I kept being cordial, understanding there was a line of cars in the back.  I noticed my ordered was wrong so I politely asked to have my order remade as I made my way through the drive-thru again.  Then at the window again, the order is wrong again and this specific employee leaves me waiting at the window while him and his coworkers have a little fun chat, he ALSO tells me he doesn't know why the order it's wrong because he didn't make it.  He starts arguing with me on how I should order to save money with a HORRIBLE ATTITUDE.  This guy definitely doesn't have customer service skills.  I was so fed up with his attitude, I just left because now I can't trust the whole team from that location to make my drinks.  I threw  away both of the drinks because I was so unsatisfied with my drinks and the attitude certainly did not help . He was absurdly disrespectful.  I should've asked for my money back but I really didn't want to spend more time there dealing with this guy.  He also covered his name because he knew he messed up. He seemed like an older looking bald, bluesh, greenedh eyes, short beard, wears eyeglasses. I've been a loyal starbucks customer for over 15 years and NEVER BEFORE been treated this poorly. As a matter of fact, I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED LIKE AT ANY OTHER COMPANY AT ALL this as poorly as this person treated me!Seriously!! From reading all reviews I guess I'm not the only person that has had this awful experience at this location!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Apr 3, 2019~Went in to this Starbucks over the weekend with Harvey.  I waited outside in the patio area with Bruno, our dog while he got coffee and tea for us.  It was great as usual.  While we were just enjoying our beverages outside Michelle(one of the baristas) came up and said hi to us and our dog.  Bruno is usually extremely shy around new people but he loved Michelle and opened right up to her.  She even brought Bruno out a puppychino which was super nice and kind.  Michelle is an amazing person.  Thank you for making our weekend.  Michelle, Harvey and Bruno.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jul 13, 2018~This is got to be one of the worst Starbucks ever! This is the second time they didn't make my coffee when ordering through the mobile app! What's the point of ordering ahead of time if I don't get what I'm ordering?!?! This is ridiculous. Today the ladies were just standing in the back and didn't even acknowledge me at all!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 12, 2020~Customer service in the drive thru was very poor. I repeated my order many times to where I was screaming at the intercom. The person helping me kept getting the order wrong in the intercom and proceeded to say, `"I don't know what you want.`" By then I had just given up.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Nov 8, 2018~Not the best atmosphere to enJOY your drink. The homeless are abundant there. They had to remove the outside couch because the cops were called late one Thursday night two weeks ago. I'm sorry I do NOT agree with their open door policy. There are times I've come in, and there's NO place to sit. One guy had ALL his possessions spread all over the table. Another homeless guy smelled so bad you didn't WANT to sit at his table.AND, to top it off, there was one homeless guy waiting to use the restroom for OVER 30 minutes. The baristas kept knocking on the door but the guy inside wouldn't come out!!! When we finally were leaving, the guy came outta the restroom. The other homeless guy finally went in. It was the WORST experience I have EVER had at a Starbucks! SOMETHING needs to change!I am sitting outside there now. A homeless guy is ranting &amp; ranting, talking to himself as he SMOKES a cigarette. No one is coming out to stop his smoking or ranting. I can't get up &amp; go in to complain because he will know it was me. I AM sympathetic to them, I understand some need help. WHY don't they get help?! If I were you, I'd find another location.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Apr 10, 2018~The worst starbucks i have ever been too. Waited 40+ minutes for one drink and sandwich. Finally asked an associate what was taking so long. She just shrugged her shoulders and said their really busy. Come to find out they lost my drink and food in the midst of the khaos and didnt care. Horrible customer service. I got my money back and would not recommend anyone to go there.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~4~Dec 4, 2019~Coffees are the best here .The house coffee and the egg Nog latte are some.of which I have tried and liked .You find people from all walks of life .Students ,people on date ,friends meeting up etc all enjoying and sipping their sip of coffee in Starbucks usually .The Starbucks app lets you collect stars when you upload receipts for points n rewards
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Mar 4, 2021~It has been my THIRD time here at this Starbucks location, and I have been here 3 different times of the day and they NEVER have sufficient ingredients for our drinks.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Dec 21, 2018~The customer service is always great every time I visit this location. Always greeted warmly when I walk through the door. I am able to order and receive my purchase in a timely fashion. The other day when I went, I liked how the barista inquired if I would like to have the brownie I ordered warmed up, it's the little things like that that really make a great customer service moment. Thank you for all that you do Starbucks on Northern and I hope you continue!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Dec 1, 2017~Always great coffee and plenty of space to do school work or website work for my salon.  Fresh hot coffee and delicious healthy snacks always.  Breakfast, lunch or dinner here and I'm content.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 17, 2020~I wanted a nitro cold brew with sweet cream Iced the cashier insisted on telling me how it comes it doesn't come this way or that way ,all I wanted was ice ! People go through Starbucks asking for 2 pumps of this ,this type of milk bla bla bla and I can't ask for my drink iced and the cashier keeps telling me how it comes everyone modifies their drinks it's Starbucks ! And apparently I can't ask for ice I came home and put my own ice but wow
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jul 5, 2020~I don't know if this place got new management but keep up the good work! I came by today and Elena's help was excellent. Thank you! Will come by again.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Jun 20, 2018~This place has the potential to be a great coffee shop. Actual, the coffee was decent. But they have a deceitfully advertised closing time posted on their website and right on the front glass near the entrance. Both say `"10:30pm`".  But I was asked to leave the premises at 9:30, an hour before the clearly posted closing time of `"10:30pm.`"  As a matter of fact as I sat outside finishing my coffee, 3 other potential customers attempted to enter but were equally surprised at the premature closed Starbucks.  They felt deceived as well.  This was very upsetting. The management needs to specify the proper closing time in the appropriate places so not to further deceive and upset potential customers.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~4~Jun 18, 2017~This is the Starbucks I go to often.  I like the staff.  They never seem to be flustered when I pay with my phone app.  Best of all they give me a mighty fine cup of coffee when I need it most.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Feb 4, 2020~Every time I come to this location they're out of product and they always suggest me drinks that are nothing like what i originally had asked for. Today I went and got a drink from a young man named Roman and he got rude with me while I was ordering and if it weren't for there being people infront of an behind me I wouldn't have ordered anything. Sad thing is I literally live off 19th ave an Northern and am a regular at this location but dealing with the bad attitudes and customer service isn't worth it. I might start spending my money at Dutch bros instead.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Jun 22, 2018~I've only been to this location a couple times, but every time I'm there it's great. The Baristas are wonderful and will have a conversation with me. They're always smiley, laughing with each other, which is great to find positive people in the morning. The line for the drive through is always around the block and the parking lot is hard to maneuver for that reason. Inside I've never seen it too busy, so a typical stop before work is about ten minutes.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Sep 4, 2016~We visited this new Starbucks on Northern Avenue and the floor was dirty the windows were dirty. The service was good and the product was good.  We just thought it should've been a little more clean. Just because it's in a bad area doesn't mean the store has to reflect that.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 10, 2019~I've been to this location over a year now because is the closest to my home but this year they hired a barista. White man middle age with glasses and tattoos who never fails to give me the worst customer service. I've been to too many Starbucks locations before and I know exactly what to order but this guy is unbelievable rude. I stopped coming here because he always messes up my order and never apologizes. I came back today because I figured maybe he wasn't working there anymore. Nope. Couldn't get my order right again, seems to have a problem with anyone who's not white.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Nov 21, 2017~I go here because it's a walking distance from my job. I order by mobile  so when I get there I can just pick it up and eat at my job. However, this is the THIRD time they get my order wrong. I always order a spicy chorizo sandwich with NO CHEESE and they always have it with cheese. It's annoying that I order to just pick it up and end up having to wait because they can't read a label that states NO CHEESE. You would think they would apologize or give me a gift card to compensate but nope! Another time I had ordered a blonde coffee and I waited for about half an hour because they did tell me it would take a few minutes but I didn't imagine it would take half an hour. I go and ask them if it's almost ready just for them to tell me they hadn't even started it yet. Overall they have very slow service and their drinks are either too strong or flavorless.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Apr 20, 2018~I ordered a grande iced coffee with a warmed cheese danish .... I get to the drive through window and pay with my Starbucks app .... the girl hands me my iced coffee and starts grabbing other drinks for the next people ... I ask her where's my cheese danish and she says we didn't charge you for it so I say it's fine and drive off ... and then I look on my app after leaving to see what they charged me and they did charge me for the cheese danish...  Thanks for over charging me ....
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Oct 13, 2019~I'm a simple grande iced caramel macchiato girl! I went into Starbucks today and my coffee was WAY too sweet. My friend asked politely if he can remake it because the drink was too sweet. The barista looks and him like my friend is dumb and said that's how it's supposed to be. He asked again if they can just re-do it and the barista said `"I can charge you 99 cents for an extra shot`" I rather go to another coffee shop and pay again for something better. Right after that a lady had came back up and was a bit up set cause she had asked for light ice and the drink was like half way full. The guys again was like `"that's how the drink is`" People don't pay over $5 for coffee to not be the way they want it. I go to many other Starbucks locations, and when I have a drink problem, it's fixed right away with the best attitude and they're so generous. I hope this does not continue. Sadly I will not be coming back to this Starbucks. Management please work on costumer service. Thank you!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Sep 13, 2019~Trash!!! Slowest Starbucks I've ever been too and all the staff in here does is mess around!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 29, 2016~I've visited three times in the last week. I've discovered that the less busy the location is, the slower the service. I just waited ten minutes for one drink, and I was the only car in the drive thru, and there were only a couple of people in the parking lot. I wanted to leave, but had already paid. They definitely got that done quickly...
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 15, 2016~I went last Saturday before an appt. . I waited 20 minutes with just 6 cars in front of me. I ordered a Strawberry and creme. It had no flavor at all.  I was excited when I saw them building it near my home. But if I go back I will go in for faster service and to let them know what happened before.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 1, 2019~I ordered a cold brew with cascara cold foam. It tasted like a regular iced coffee( it wasn't smooth) and the cold foam was not airy and sweet. It tasted like an iced coffee with cream. I did not enjoy it. I was already on the freeway and unable to turn around to get a replacement. Disappointed.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 23, 2016~Horrible service.... Went here and they made my drink wrong. When I went back to have them fix it. They proceeded to tell me it's not there problem... I go to Starbucks 5/7 days out of the week and never had this horrible of customer service! Go the extra mile up the road and go to that Starbucks...
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jul 11, 2016~Slowest Starbucks on the planet. Seriously how long does it take to make a pre made iced coffee? Sigh.....
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jun 6, 2019~coffee was great but when I went for the $3 frapp Roman was SOOOO rude to my deaf cousin. I asked him to just have patience with him and Roman continued just being so rude to this poor 10 year old. The kid obviously can't hear perfectly and roman clearly saw he had hearing aids and was struggling and was just so mean and I will never go to that one again.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 17, 2018~Prepare to wait that the Starbucks. If you go in they do not put anything in order drive-through comes 1st period iced drinks take the longest for some unknown reason. Not a good Starbucks in the area.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~May 17, 2019~Never going to this Starbucks again because they don't give what you ask. I worked with Starbucks and quit about 2 months ago, but I get the Matcha Green Tea Latte Iced. One time I asked for this drink in a Venti size and I asked for Light Ice and Carmel Drizzle with Vanilla Syrup (Really Good)... they didn't give me light ice and they didn't give me a drizzle, only a swirl on top and they charged me. The second time I asked for the same thing and they didn't give me light ice and they didn't add vanilla... oh and they left an inch of space... I'm I didn't say less product, I said less ice. Smfh they don't listen and light ice makes a difference, I don't want my drink watered down!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Nov 13, 2016~Quick, clean, and crafted beautifully with a smile.I was greeted warmly, my name was placed on the cup for verification and was handed to me with a `"thank you`". The store was decorated with holiday cheer, and is managed well. I will return to this store.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Mar 8, 2018~I stopped at this Starbucks location (drive-thru) on my way to work and ordered a coffee and a pumpkin loaf. When I arrived at work, I discovered that the plastic bag that the pumpkin loaf was in, had a gaping hole that clearly had been there for awhile because the loaf was completely stale. DISGUSTING!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Apr 22, 2018~I usually have great service at this location. The cashier Robby was extremely rude.you think with all the problems going on with Starbucks they would be a little more friendly!!! But not this one look like Robbie was having a bad day so she took it out in the customer !   Will not be back !!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Aug 20, 2017~This place is filthy there is spilled coffee on the floor and papers on the floor and table. The outside is just as bad.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Mar 12, 2018~One of the best Starbucks I have been to. One of the baristas, I think his name was Ben is super helpful, courteous and shows interest in the customer. I'm not from the area but he knew all of the regulars' drink orders. Very knowledgeable and super polite.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Aug 6, 2018~Great service and nice atmosphere. People don't seem to make decaff anymore.  So for my half decaf half regular, they made the decaf Americano style. That was very nice
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~May 13, 2017~I am surprised this location has such bad reviews. I've had nothing but great service here, very quick. I come 3-4 times a week for coffee &amp; teas. I usually order through the mobile app 10 mins before so it's ready soon as I get there, which I recommend if you are in a hurry. They are clean, friendly, and super bubbly in the morning lol I love it here. Especially Chenin, she always makes my custom drink on point! Thanks guys!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 11, 2019~if i could give it no stars i would . very slow services with a very long line , in store and drive thru . No napkins , place is dirty . rude employees
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Nov 18, 2019~On Saturday morning the 16th of November around 11 am​, I went into this Starbuck​s with 5 of my friends. I ordered my drink first and all 5 of my friends ended up receiving​ their order before me. I asked the barista (middle-aged man with long hair and glasses) when my drink was coming out. I ordered a peppermint white chocolate mocha frappucino and he handed me a pumpkin spice frappucino. I told him the order was wrong and he rudely said would make me another one. I finally got my drink and dropped it when I got outside. Instead of asking for another one, I just purchased it again. I waited for my drink for 20 minutes or so and had to ask about it​ ​again. I was handed ANOTHER pumpkin spice frappucino. I told them my order was wrong again. A girl with brown hair made me another one and ended up giving me a vanilla bean frap with peppermint. There was no coffee in the drink whatsover. I spent a total of 45 minutes waiting for my drinks and they were not apologetic for making my drink wrong 3x. I did not even say anything about them making me a vanilla bean with peppermint instead of a white chocolate peppermint mocha because I was so fed up with being at that starbucks for so long and being treated rudely for telling them they made my drink wrong. I will NEVER be going to that location at Starbucks, especially because of the middle-aged​ man with long hair and glasses. He was the rudest of them all!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Sep 3, 2016~The worst Starbucks I've ever been too. Customer service sucks and it always takes 15-20 minutes to get a damn coffee. I absolutely hate this Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Sep 11, 2016~I have the Starbucks App. and I always place my order at least 10 minutes in advance. I've now had several instances where I walk in and my drink is not ready and the ticket is still sitting at the printer. The latest example of this was today where there weren't any vehicles at the drive thru nor waiting to order. Management - make some improvements!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Sep 23, 2017~would be nice when I come in with my daughter to not have to ask 10 minutes after we order and everyone else has received drinks (other people ordering after we have) to not have to ask and then have her drink made well after we paid and others have been served. In addition not being able to speak to a manager or receive a call back because `"they are slammed`" this time when I decided after this and all of the other time I had had enough. well its been a day now and still no manager call to at the least say they are sorry. I will never go to that location again, I hope then receive the same disservice when they are treating their loved ones to coffee
Phoenix, AZ 85021~5~Sep 19, 2017~I have given up on Starbucks...well at least I did untill I found this gem of a starbucks! Last time I had Starbucks it tasted like it was made with melted plastic instead of soy milk like I'd asked for And I vowed to never go back..it's been about 6 long starbuckless months and lately on my drives out towards the 51 freeway I'm so tired I find that a fast food coffee and energy drink together still didn't do the trick so I buckled and stopped at THIS STARBUCKS..went through the drive thru ave ordered my coffee (venti caramel frappe extra caramel and extra shot) at the window I was greeted by the sweetest girl named mikah she wasnt snotty like most baristas jaded by the drive thru position in fact we shared a laugh wich was nice! I tasted my coffee before I left and it was the best coffee i think I've ever had it wasn't too strong but def woke me up and I had the uplift from a 30 sec convo with this barista (I can't even remember what we laughed at).. I'm making this and only this Starbucks my new spot!! Ty mikah for unknowingly bringing my mermaid tail back to me!!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~2~Mar 5, 2018~This place was known for its service but these days in the evening the service has turned horrible.I stood at  kiosk and waited for the barista,Nobody addresses me forever.They hardly care when i left the kiosk.This place used to be my favorite places but not anymore.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Jul 28, 2016~I've gone here about 10 times now since it's so close by my job. Oh my gosh!!! The customer service just keeps getting worse and worse. They are so slow it's ridiculous. I mean this place is the worst!
Phoenix, AZ 85021~4~Jun 25, 2017~When I first started going here, service was very slow in the drive-thru. Things have sped up considerably though, and everyone there is very pleasant. They know me on a first hand basis now. lol
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Dec 28, 2016~This has got to be the slowest Starbucks known to man.  I am currently sitting in the drive thru line and have now been here 10 mins.  I don't know if its the staff, the customers, or a combination of the 2.  I have received 2 free drinks here in the past several weeks because of how slow they are.  Just a tip to management...get your act together, you are making the brand look bad.
Phoenix, AZ 85021~1~Feb 3, 2017~Mixed review, depending on shift. Loud, careless staff. One nazi-like marine kid who slams things around and thinks he is the city's answer to the homeless problem in the area, but just makes things worse at the expense of service to the rest of us. Think D-day, only they are bringing lattes instead of guns. It just doesn't work. He's not the only one. LOUD staff, slamming things around. Task focused, instead of customer focused, behavior and lack of manners. Just corporate trons. Don't send your kids here. Get your yuppieness to McDonald's coffee down the street.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~1 year ago~Service is good, employees are very nice. The coffee is pretty bad, been here 3 times and I regret it every time.I go here because the other Starbucks in the metro circle has a long line every time I go but I think I'll keep going to the metro one and wait for my drink to be made right. The coffee is too strong and bitter and I like my coffee really dark. Today my drink has what looks like little milk curds, smh.Train your baristas or have them taste test their coffee because it's pretty bad.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~Oct 23, 2024~43th Ave and &amp; Dunlap/OliveCame in for the `"Medicine Ball`" never had it before and had a cold and a friend told me to go get one.  Well got home, while I was drinking it it had like chunks or something.  Turns out the bag was torn open, and didn't realize.  Service, always super great.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Nov 10, 2022~They took FOREVER to make 2 drinks. At least 15 minutes I was in line with only 2 cars in front of me. Terrible service.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~May 22, 2024~Terrible place of establishment. Waste of time and the worst customer service alive to human kind. 0 stars
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Jul 22, 2024~Idk why I see bad reviews maybe because it's a smaller shop but honestly the staff is super nice an never messes up my order unlike a lot of other shops so I get that it takes time to do it right some people just impatient
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jan 30, 2024~Really tried to love this location but I've received many nasty bitter drinks from here. Not worth returning, I rather support a local business...sorry Starbies! The service is okay but the drinks are horrible. Small location, cannot study here as it's only has a walk up window and drive through.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Apr 11, 2023~States they're open until 9pm, but when you show up at 8:40 the employees tell you they're closing early (with NO posted signage or indication other than a TRASH CAN blocking the drive through). Will be calling to complain tomorrow to the store manager as that's completely unprofessional.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Mar 14, 2024~I pay for extra for the foam, and that's all I got. Thought it was a one time thing, but it happens every time I order. It's only an issue for this location too. Every other location actually gives you what you pay for.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Oct 27, 2023~I do not recommend this Starbucks. They are disorganized and lazy. I placed a mobile order about  15 minutes ahead of the time I'd be there and it was still not ready. I pulled up and it was not busy so i thought my drink would be ready and the barista told me they where still working on my iced coffee. I did not end up getting my drink because I had go to work. It was ridiculous that it takes them 30 minutes to make a coffee! It shows me that the employees are lazy and their management is WEAK! WORST LOCATION EVER.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jan 23, 2024~The manager there her name is Gabby. I placed an order through DoorDash for an iced coffee. My order came with a hot coffee so I contacted DoorDash. I figured it was the Dashers fault. They made the order and sent it out again the second time came out hot again with Hair inside. My drink so I knew it was DoorDash his fault so I called direct to the Starbucks and asked to speak to the lady who made my drink. When I spoke to her she kept saying that she put ice and she made that drink personally and that there was ice, but there was not the drink was hot even the Dasher scene because there was no ice. I opened it up in front of the Dasher the second time to make so I told her you are doing this on purpose. She kept persisting that I'm lying so then I spoke to another manager and explained to her and asked, why are they doing this and if I could come in and rehab my order made or get a refund they kept saying that basically I'm lying so I said I'm gonna come through the drive-through myself with the two hot coffees and let you see for yourself because there is no ice and that there is hair in there. She basically said that even if I bring the drinks in that I'm still lying so don't ever order from the store. It's horrible the manager her name is Gabby. She is horrible. I am going to call corporate.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~1 year ago~Horrible service, location is the biggest headache to access, and their quality is worse than week old 7/11 coffee. Messed up a coffee order and then wouldn't fix it when asked. Much respect to the employees in food service but be warned this place is the worst Starbucks in PHX, AZ, United States.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jun 2, 2023~First time at this location and It took me 30 minutes to get through the drive through, Terrible! Starbucks Corp needs to fix this, so many bad reviews about the wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~4~Sep 1, 2023~The service is fabulous, they remember my order, &amp; my name.  I'm at home here,  It's a pick up location, no inside service but the employees have enthusiasm.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Nov 17, 2022~It was my birthday today and I never received the birthday gift on my app, even though I've had my account since forever. Usually they'll still give you a birthday drink if you're able to provide proof, and I had more than enough proof. Yet, they still refused to give me a birthday drink. Go to another Starbucks, they'll treat you better.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Aug 17, 2023~One of my favorite Starbucks, and mainly just because the employees! Thank you everyone at this store for showing up and doing your best in a world full of un-appreciative people
Phoenix, AZ 85051~3~Jul 4, 2023~This Starbucks sucks. Like bad. There `"walkup`" window is terrible. It's either broken, the wait is `"20-30 minutes`" or they mess up your order. However, given the area it makes sense
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jul 22, 2023~Why does this location have to be the convenient one by my house. They mess up every single mobile order. They just can't get it together. What a shame. Today they Served me a cold sandwich that is supposed to be warm. When I ask for a new one they purposely burnt the sandwich. When I returned and ask for my money back there were no apologies (you could tell on her face she did it on purpose.)
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Jun 23, 2022~Im not sure if thr is the right starbucks on  4265 W Dunlap Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85051. This is my first time writing a starbucks review, but I just had to because these two ladies were amazing.Right now starbucks is have 50%off any drink, and for some reason it was working. Isjah the one who took my order was trying to figure it out, but when she couldn't she asked Danielle for assistance. Can just say I don't know if Danielle a Manger, but she handled that situation like a boss. Let's just say I left very happy and satisfied. Thanks again ladies.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Sep 20, 2022~The `"supervisor `" during the evening shift is very rude to customers, and when you have a concern he will close the window on your face. Employees are nice tho.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Mar 26, 2023~Another COVID19 failure of what was said to be the Best Customer Service In the coffee industry. Well Failure occurred when I drove to the closest a d not best rated (1.6 miles away..on Peoria)So I proceeded to place my orderTWO Trinty Iced CoffeeWith Whip, Extra Cream, Extra Sugar and Carmel DrizzleInquired about bagels...they had one left... Should have left it there....sad little thing. But ordered the Pumpkin bread for the wife. Got to the window, and total was $10.45 and said... Hmm  we have a problem.They handed one coffee (missing Carmel and Whip)Then handed 2 bags luke warm and proceed to say `"Have a nice Day`" smiling and I said we are missing a drink.. To her surprise she says..`"I only see 1`", hmm well the first thing on the list was TWO Trintie Iced Coffees... So she recovers and says lt me get started on that. Another woman comes to the window and say.. Sir it will be $4.98: I commented for a drink ahe forgot. She says yeah....I say here you go...She scanned my phone App and I drove on.Now 24 hours ago....Exactly The same situation occurred and they made my missing drink and said ..`"Have a great  day, apologies for missing your second coffee . Bill was $10.98.Time to drive for the service
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~1 year ago~I don't know why they hire people that don't know how to make drinks. They make you stir your own drink because they're too lazy to do it.. I got a a coffee with vanilla powered and it was just at the bottom. Not even stirred. They also gave me a cheese danish not even warm. Unprofessional. Only nice person was the girl that took orders.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Apr 11, 2022~Chelsea was so sweet and made mine and my friends drinks, even though there was an overwhelming line of customers, she still took the time to make them perfect!! Definitely will be a returning customer :)
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~Feb 8, 2023~This is the worst of the worst as far as drive thrus go...10 minutes in line before making it to the ordering panel, then acknowledged by, `"I helped you already right?`" You can't be apart of a chain or franchise and be so disorganized unless you have a serious management problem.  Today is a Saturday but I would never dream of coming here on an actual weekday--not convenient.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jul 18, 2020~This store is horrible! Don't go here! The staff is rude, slow, and are mad about working! I will never go here again!!!!!!!! I should have asked for a refund and went elsewhere, next time I definitely will! Wish I could give 0 stars for this location!
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jan 25, 2023~I go to Starbucks every day for the past 15 years and I unfortunately will not be going to this location which is down the street from my home. I understand that sometimes they don't take larger bills more than $20 I had a $50 bill and that's all I had And the manager on duty pretty much said because my order was only two drinks, and they had just dropped change. They were unable to service me unless I had a different method of payment, which I didn't very disappointed with this customer service didn't even offer to give me my drinks for free or, any other option so unfortunately I left with no drinks waited 15 minutes in the drive-through for nothing my money wasn't good enough unfortunately, very dissatisfied I worked in retail in management for many years and I would've taken care of my customer knowing that they come every day I have spent thousands of dollars for the past 15 years I guess I'll take my business to Dutch!
Phoenix, AZ 85051~4~May 27, 2023~Monday 7:35am- surprisingly, the drive thru was empty. Normally, it's so busy every morning I pass by. This isn't my usual Starbucks but service was fast and very friendly. I'd return.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jun 17, 2019~One of the worst Starbucks I've been at. Some of the workers always have an attitude and act like they hate working here. I am so tired of pulling into this Starbucks during their open hours just to find the drive thru is closed for no reason. Happened again tonight get there about 1.5hr before they close and drive thru has a barrier infront of it. So ridiculous guess I will have to go to a different one .
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Nov 19, 2020~Stopped by this morning and was highly dissatisfied, my drink tasted like sanitizer water, wth!! My day is ruined
Phoenix, AZ 85051~3~Feb 14, 2019~This is the Starbucks you go to if you want them to make your drink wrong. I live near this Starbucks but hate going because the line gets so long but the lot isn't big enough to support a long line. Easy traffic jam. I can only count a handful of times where they made my coffee or tea correctly. One time they didn't have any cold brew. Another time they didn't have any peach infusion.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Apr 10, 2021~I have an additional observation I wanted to share. This starbucks location runs out of certain items sometimes. This is a drive-thru location with no inside dining room and there is no way to escape the drive-thru line if you can't order what you came for. The drive-thru line can back up and the crossover traffic starts to block the parking lot then it causes customers to become trapped in the drive-thru line. When you finally get to the drive-thru speaker to place an order and they tell you, `"we ran out of that...`" You will become trapped and you have to wait for 20 minutes or more just to exit the drive-thru line.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Dec 22, 2018~This Starbucks location is only a drive-thru with a walk-up window in a dangerous spot. The drive-thru can get very busy during certain mornings where the drive-thru line can potentially back up into the street making it unsafe for motorists and pedestrians.  The drive-thru lane wraps around the building. If the location is very busy, there can be a traffic crossover in the parking lot that can create another unsafe situation.  Traffic can enter from two separate street entrances and can clog up the parking lot when too many cars enter the property.  Merging into the drive-thru lane can become tricky and frustrating if this happens. Also, the scenerio causes the drive-thru exit to become blocked by traffic sitting in the lot when cars are waiting to merge into the drive-thru line. The drive-thru line wraps around the building. If you choose to park in the lot try backing out of the parking space when vehicles are waiting to merge into the drive-thru line. There is no place provided to sit if you use the walk-up window and there are no public restrooms provided. If the location becomes very busy it can become difficult to exit too. Also, some of the location staff has been rather sassy and rude to customers but other workers have been so-so. The staff are not always very friendly here. I spoke to one female manager about my concerns and she was very rude to me. She told me that I should call the City of Phoenix to complain about street traffic caused from the Starbucks. They have plenty of other customers and they don't need me. She also said I could go somewhere else and that I didn't make any sense among other things... There is a Dunkin a mile West of here up the road.  Most other Starbucks locations don't have employees that will talk back and argue with customers. This one is a little different. Starbucks was contacted about the situation and they indicated they are not interested in a resolution at this time.  They think they have other convenient locations and they won't consider a future location. It sounded like the manager wanted to send business over to Dunkin. However, there are not very many other locations in the area and especially if you are headed in certain geographical directions from the southwest of this facility. See if you can find a convenient location. On the other hand, if the location is not very busy and the drive-thru line is not clogged up then there are usually no issues. In any case, It's probably better to avoid this Starbucks location if you don't have to visit this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~1 year ago~Great service very friendly and they always get my drinks right. Saw some questionable reviews if this location which appear to be some high school drama.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Oct 9, 2020~I am never going here again! Arrived at the drive thru at 8:15 and waited till 8:35 to be informed it was closed. There was no sign on the drive thru or anywhere that it will be closing at 8 instead of 9.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Jan 25, 2022~Waits are long but I mean it's Starbucks what do you expect! Staff is always friendly and never messed up my order. I was really surprised to see some of these reviews. Maybe just go to a different Starbucks at least you would make the rest of our waits shorter!!! Haha
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Jun 18, 2020~Went to  this location and line was so long  people couldn't get out of drive-thru window so I decided to  go to walk up window where I was initially ignored. Ordered a matcha Frappuccino, my drink  took 15 minutes to make  wrong. It was so sweet I had to throw it away. Why are you not consistent with the rest of Starbucks, will not  recommend this establishment.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~4~Nov 28, 2019~I ordered a drink this morning on the mobile-app, I love how it was so easy and the girl that helped me out was a sweetie. I will go back and use the mobile-app again. Super easy and fast. No wait time at all.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~May 7, 2019~The worst Starbucks ever!!! I had to wave my hand a few times to get anyone's attention at the drive thru window only to be ignored after 3 employees looked right at me. Finally one employee tells me, someone will be right with me. My drink sat at the window for 3 mins getting cold. I also ordered a WARM banana but bread only to receive it cold. Thanks Starbucks at 43rd Ave and Olive. I may be late to my job interview now.... I would give zero stars if I could.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Dec 10, 2019~The first guy that helped me was so low energy and new tbh. He took one order and didn't ask if that was it so he closed the window on us AANNDD THENNNN I rang the door bell cuz whatever. But the next girl to help me was so dead! No energy, bad attitude and rude demeanor!!! So rude!! I wish I could give them half a star.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~Apr 14, 2019~Ok normally am very satisfied and happy! I ordered a drink through app on Tuesday my drink was ready for pick up! And yes it was busy and my drink didn't just look like a sloppy drink just mushed together! Today the reason is the Affrogota shot makes it like that!!! Annoyed because hey presentation should be something when you paying the price of almost a meal just for a cup of coffee I get a sloppy drink looking! Stood at window and still had to wait for people who ordered right in front of me get there before I got mines and yes it's all about patience but just annoying when I put in an order online pay and yet someone who walk in line in front me orders and gets there first really I ordered 15 minutes ago they ordered 2 minutes and get there really........ guess it depend on who is working! Just annoyed with having to wait longer and my drink just looking like they just tossed everything in it! NO nice Starbucks presentation! Sorry my complaint sounds stupid lol but I guess I am so use to having the nice Starbucks presentation and then getting a drink that looks like I got a caramel milkshake from McDonald's and paying Starbucks price..... just annoying! My complaint is silly but My caramel Frap, with 2 shots of Affrogato shot drink taste good and overall! And I guess that's what they mean about (coffee with ice cream) shot.. Ohhhhh but it's just so sloppy looking that it makes it hard to really enjoy because `"hey presentation from Starbucks is a plus`" makes me feel like my dollar is being spent right! Silly complaint... I know! I know!
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Mar 8, 2019~A girl named Chaz spit in my drink and told me to shut up when I asked for a new one. I don't know what to do about this but it is concerning
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Sep 22, 2020~Came to this location on Thursday 11/19. We waited more than 15 minutes in  drive thru line, while the barista  was having a full conversation with a customers. There was about  7 other cars in front of me also waiting.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~1 year ago~They were very unfriendly and I thought maybe it was because they were busy but then I got my two hot coffees I drove out the drive through and took a sip my drink was lukewarm. It's so upsetting that after I even tipped (and didn't even get my receipt to scan) my drinks weren't even hot.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Apr 28, 2021~Bad service all around won't be going to this location ever again. Seems like the only location that doesn't do refills on teas
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Aug 23, 2018~I'm a regular at this location and today I decided to not take drive- thru because there was a long a long line . That was a mistake,  I was in line from 846a and I walked out of there at 914a. It was hot but I didn't mind to be honest what bothered me was that even when I waited that long my drinks weren't made correctly. Some barristas at Starbucks when they're asked to make the drink again because it's not how you usually get it or it's off for whatever reason . It's like they don't agree with you. Sometimes they should just ask what can they do to make it better instead of `" that's how we make it . `" Also , I think that they should maybe have a sign or something to let customers know that there's a long wait.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Aug 1, 2020~Thank you guys for getting my drink wrong before I have to go into work so I can't even turn around and get a new one. So fucking annoying how I can notice my drink looks weirder than usual and I ask the cashier taking my money `"hey are you sure this is my green tea lemonade?`" She legit looks me in my face and says `"yes.`" LOOK AT THE DAMN DRINK, there was already a line and I couldn't say `"no this is wrong make it again.`" I'm not an asshole but damn you guys know how to ruin someone's day. If you guys weren't the only Starbucks nearby that I don't have to go into a grocery store to get I wouldn't buy from you, id have more enjoyment watching my money be spent places that get my simple orders correct.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Mar 22, 2019~Worst Starbucks ever , I ordered 4 iced vanilla lattes and they gave me 4 black iced coffees and i went back to fix my order and they said I didn't order what I said I showed the receipt and they're like oh sorry they give me my drinks back and they're still a complete different drink so I just left it at that , workers are idiots
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Apr 7, 2019~Every time I come to this Starbucks they manage to get my order wrong or charge me wrong. Maybe it's just me but they also have the worst attitudes. They rarely say hello and just stick there hand out for your card, you're lucky if they bother mentioning the total.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Feb 13, 2020~i used to love this starbucks everyone was so kind and attentive but when the barista at the window tells me they don't have my order because the person in front payed for me but took my drinks?  and they take forever to make the drinks and still make them incorrectly
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~Apr 27, 2021~Asked for heavy cream, they `"ran out`"... asked for splendas, they didn't add any... asked for vanilla syrup, she didn't add any... very disappointing. My first crappy Starbucks drink on Christmas.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~4~Dec 25, 2018~This has to be the only stabucks around. They are amazing, there is another TIffany who makes mobile orders about the same time as I do in the mornings. If there ever is a mix up they are so quick to fix it! My drinks are generally always about the same my complaint is the freaking people the customers, the size and the horrible traffic in and out of this spot. In order to wait in the drive through line you're blocking patrons who parked and drive through exit not to mention the the entrance/exit
Phoenix, AZ 85051~2~May 14, 2018~Really REALLY suggest management review their protocol for keeping the line moving thru the drive thru. There are those who show up to the ordering speaker unprepared and then they want to change their order at the window! Management should have them pull over to the side or one of the parking lanes so that the rest of the  line of cars doesnt have to wait over 15 min for a single item.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~1~1 year ago~One starfor the super sweet girl working the drive through window, Waited in the amazingly- long line which always take forever unless you get there at a time when nobody's there,ordered my usual peach green tea,finally make it around to the pick up window. As I'm chatting it up with the girl in drive-through waiting for the rest of my order I take a sip of my peach green tea and can instantly tell something is not right. I tell her the drink taste off and repeat what I had ordered,she says `"oh we're out of peach green tea`" she offered to fix it with guava or something else, but because I am on a strict keto plan I was unsure about substitutions. Frustrated that the girl who took my order did not convey the message to me that they were out of the peach green tea and I also feel like I should've got my money back since it was not what I ordered and I didn't get anything else to replace it. Usually have good luck at this location,but not having what I order and not letting me know is kind of major to me.
Phoenix, AZ 85051~5~Jun 15, 2020~One of the things that makes this Starbucks a high quality restaurant is the extremely friendly and hardworking employees that go out of their way to make your experience a very pleasant one.  I've never been disappointed or treated poorly at this current location.  As one can see, while you are in the cafe, you can't miss the quickness and efficiency of these pleasant individuals.  Every drink and food item is prepared by properly trained employees who never missing a beat with the flavor. Every employee at this location is representative of the communities that they serve, especially at this location.  The different styles and friendly personalities makes this location  a genuine coffee house vibe. As said by a consumer `"This company has earned its popularity by maintaining a great quality business.`" Starbucks makes their location fitting for everyone, giving them a cool friendly vibe, with a modern style.     Starbucks has an extremely fast drink making and food process, the quality however in top notch.  Every Customer has a certain time frame they want their drink made within before they get upset. Starbucks employees are trained to make drinks quickly and accurately using precise recipes.  Every drink is made exactly the same to ensure drink accuracy and customer enjoyment. Starbucks also has a mobile order service that allows you to order ahead. From experience, if you are short on time, and still needing your caffeine fix, you can destress by using the website or mobile app to place your order.  You can pick it up in the drive thru or walk up window and be on your way.  Sometimes freshness may be an issue , especially if the service lines are out onto the street. One thing this starbucks does compensate you for your long wait or if your drink is not up to your standards. Every Starbucks is different, but you won't be disappointed in this one.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 28, 2024~I had an Amazing Conversation with J, manager of the Best Starbucks in ouSolar System. J Reflects it began in 2016 as a Barista. He is from Phoenix, AZ.

Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 8, 2024~I go to this Starbucks often and I love the staff here!! They are all soooo friendly and cute! It is always clean and has a positive vibe. My drinks are always made perfectly. They handed out little samples the other day through the driv-thru and I was shocked (I've never gotten one before haha!) but I was so excited!! Thanks Starbies :)
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jul 13, 2023~I go to alot of Starbucks and spend alot of $ there because there customer service is usually great for one of the reasons. It's a very large company now with thousands of employees so I knew I'd eventually run into some bad ones and the Manager Ben at this one is the worst Starbucks employee I ever met.Over a year ago, I was in a hurry and left my cup on my table at their Bell and Tatum location. The manager at that time, Ben again, ran after me outside and ordered I go back inside and throw the cup away. I usually do clean up after myself as a courtesy but in my opinion customers are not obliged to clean their tables. This is part of the employees job when necessary. Starbucks is not cheap and thats part of the service.I told `"Ben`" I was not going back in to clean my cup off and bye.I posted a negative review on `"Ben`" for this incident as I believe it was totally out of line, as well as his demeanor, tone and phrasing was very aggressive and demanding after I already left the store.About a year later it turns out `"Ben`" is managing the SB at Thunderbird and 40th st. I didn't realize this until he jumped in my personal space and again demanded I clean one cup off the table as I was leaving. He even demanded we have a `"talk`" at the table that I must watch my behavior at `"his`" Starbucks if I want to remain a customer there. I told him I just won't go there anymore because I don't pay a premium for coffee to be harassed and treated so disrespectfully.Note: I have been going to Starbucks regularly since 1994 and have never dealt with a manager as rude as Ben and have never had anyone else tell me to clean my table. I usually do this anyway but on the rare times I leave something it's a cup or two and not my job to clean everything as all other employees understand apparently except Ben. He is literally the only manager I've encountered acting this way in my close to 30 years of Starbucks patronage spending thousands of my $$ at over 1000 Starbucks.Today, I go to this PV location looking to get out of the 115F heat for a cool drink and there is Ben again! I literally thought this guy was like Jack Nicholson in `"The Shining`". He was behaving in a very creepy, threatening way and jumped in my personal space again blocking my way shouting `"REMEMBER ME!!!`"I was seriously worried this guy would get violent and backed away and realized it was Ben from the Bell and Thunderbird locations(which presents the question why is he  moving around so much apparently other people have issues with `"Ben`").
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Nov 8, 2024~So disappointed- I walked into pick up my order with my child and we walked into a huge gay pride flag inside the store. This is just unacceptable to me- I'm not anti pride, however as I business, you should not be shoving your beliefs down customers throats. This is not a discussion I should be having with my child when we just went in to innocently get a drink. Politics and business should not be mixed. I am so disappointed. I will not be returning to Starbucks, and this location specifically. Do better Starbucks.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 19, 2023~Love this Starbucks. My order is always ready when I arrive and even though I place mobile orders, the team still goes out of their way to interact with me. Christina is always very friendly and helpful!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Jun 10, 2021~Second time at this location. Absolutely, love it. Always well staffed with friendly staff and providing awesome customer service. I love the size of this location, plenty of elbow room for those still concerned about social distancing.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Nov 3, 2023~they don't have the toasted white chocolate mocha anymore as part of their seasonal drinks for the holidays :( but i heard there are some alternate ways to order. Peter one of the baristas was so helpful and gave excellent service and i hope this is seen by managers so he is recognized for his hard work and service!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Dec 19, 2023~They've  got a good employee, their service is always respectful and meaningful, customer's service ain't that bad
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 7, 2023~Peter, thank you for correcting MY mistake and remaking my coffee for free. I so appreciate your kindness today.  40th St and Thunderbird
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Oct 30, 2022~Sandwiches left under heater too long!Our sandwich had no evidence of cheese other than the bread had turned orange because it melted into the bread. We got so sick because of these sandwiches that I can't say I will ever get a sandwich at this location!Please beware of when sandwiches come off of the heat lamp!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 2, 2023~Kara made my husband and I's quick stop into starbucks an awesome one! She was above and beyond helpful and friendly. It's rare to come across employees who take pride in what they do and have a genuine kindness towards customers. Any company is lucky to have Kara as a part of their team!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Sep 16, 2023~Worse, I don't understand it took 12 min for me to receive my nitro coffee after I placed an order. I'm watching 2 people stand around not working. Drive thru is quicker. Nitro cold brew you pour it and place in counter. 12 min!!!! I'm over Starbucks and having to use drive thru to get my order .
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Oct 13, 2020~Ran in while I was waiting to meet a friend. I had never been inside this location and was impressed with the open concept! I used to work at Starbucks and really enjoy the diverse architecture of their buildings! The service was friendly enough and my beverage was delicious! They are practicing safe social distancing during these Covid-19 times. Thanks Starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 26, 2023~Worst service in town! The girl on the window was super mean and angry. Very disappointed
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 23, 2022~Love this location! This is the second time I got a friendly note! Thank you for the great drink and great service!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jan 24, 2023~Always been a great location! My drinks are always made quickly &amp; the taste is always spot on. Trae made my coffee this morning and did great!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Jan 2, 2023~Cool spot. It can get loud so not the best to study. People aren't as considerate here. The new manager was conducting an interview right behind me and he knew I was studying. He should've been able to read the room. Like I said, not the best spot to study.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Feb 22, 2020~This location is now located where the old Boston Market was. I noticed some other reviews have talked about this establishment but they have the wrong address. This is not the one located in the Fry's grocery store across the street from this location. This location is a stand-alone establishment with a great patio and drive-thru. It has tons of seating and the ambiance is absolutely outstanding. I am glad to have such a wonderful new Starbucks within walking distance of my apartment. Eat, Drink, and be Merry, my Friends!!!!!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Aug 3, 2021~this starbucks is so nicely decorated.  staff seemed nice and super friendly with their regulars.  took us a bit to get our ready which i didn't understand why.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jul 14, 2022~Outstanding location with spacious interior and nice seating, and friendly employees. They wished me a happy birthday when I redeemed my drink which was awesome.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Feb 15, 2021~Went here this afternoon and was very fortunate to be helped my Haley! She was kind polite and very knowledgeable! The drink was absolutely amazing like usual and if you're planning on going here don't forget to ask for Haley!!!! ^_^
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Aug 14, 2021~One of the better and newer Starbucks locations. Drinks are consistent and the employees are friendly. Sometimes takes a while to get your drink even if it's not very busy. Was told they were short-staffed and trying to hire more employees.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Apr 12, 2020~I love this location, even tho it just opened up it looks amazing. It has a super chill vide and the whole lay out is very open and clean. Although you can't really sit down rn they do offer drive through and mobile orders. Which is really great if yoo he's running late. Although the customer service is nice and I've never had a rude barista here, it does take a lot longer than others in the area.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Sep 5, 2021~This place has a lot of mosquitos flying around. Gets pretty annoying when you're trying to study or get work done.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~Jun 18, 2020~This is a shout out to the lady who served my Venit iced Blonde Latte with toffee nut and white chocolate around 2pm. You made my week! The simple small talk made reality so much better!
Phoenix, AZ 85032~3~Nov 6, 2020~The staff is always kind no complaints here. I do have a recommendation and this is the only way I know how to share it. I understand you were very busy. My frustration is that the lobby was full people were not socialdistancing we need help in this. everyone was crowding the drink station this morning because there was no order on drinks while we waited. The names were called out once for a hot second and put away. People were unnecessarily crowding . People coming in didn't know these drinks were behind a black cardboard box. My drink came out and the lady didn't even bother saying my name. I know my name is difficult but there was 9 people waiting and the only thing g clear was no order amongst the team. I understand the urgency on making the drinks but you need a better system and please call out coffee names loud enough to hear , do t hide it behind a black card board where we can't see drinks are being held and even if my name is difficult to say .... say it , make it up but do something.  Also my app was not working and it's the only reason I had to wait 25 min for a single iced coffee drink.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~2~Jan 28, 2021~Okay I am gonna be that person to complain about my drink as it was made incorrectly multiple times and I have stopped going as a result. I order an iced coffee with extra sweetener and extra cream. Every single time I have gotten it it has neither enough sweetener nor cream by a long shot. I asked them to please add more once and I got attitude and barely any fix. I don't feel like spending almost $4 for a burnt taste in my mouth. It's not a difficult drink to make and it's never been that busy when I order it.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Jul 29, 2020~Visited this location today. Ordered some iced drinks to ease the 115 degree afternoon. My wife and I were the only ones in the store. We ordered drinks and started to wait. I was expecting a very important doctors call and it came as we were waiting. I distanced myself and pulled my mask down when an employee named Jeremy shouts at me to put my mask on. I point to my phone as in trying to listen to the doctor. Here shouts again. I turn so he can see my phone thinking maybe he didn't realize I was listening. He shouts about the mask again. I can't hear the doctor because this guy won't stop repeating himself. I'm ten feet away from the nearest person but he still persists about putting the mask on. I go outside, it's 115 degrees but at least I can hear. Jeremy is a really poor example of customer service. I not only felt totally unvalued as a customer, Jeremy was also shouting at me with an arrogant attitude that was completely insulting.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~3~Nov 9, 2024~Like the interiors. Very residential feel, with a 70s inspired sofa. Coffee and food is the usual.  Decent service. But prices are getting out of hand.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Nov 16, 2024~this Starbucks location seems to struggle in getting their sh*t together.The wait time is lengthy, even when there are only 1-2 cars ahead of you. Today I waited a total of 10 minutes to get a double espresso- I mean, come on.Additionally, their drinks are average at best. It is clear the effort is minimal at best. For example, they struggle to get cold foam foamy, or to the 'top'. and have forgot to to add the flavoring I requested more than once. Furthermore, it's rare that you see the same face twice. Its clear this Starbucks struggles from the top down, meaning, it is clear that management and ownership lack skill or even regard for this store.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Apr 30, 2024~Once again Starbucks serves up a perfect duplicate of my usual drink.If you are a Starbucks fan, you will be satisfied.The inside is clean and has a good number of work spaces. The outdoor patio has four tables which are sometimes in the sun and sometimes not. Probably best to be outside in the morning.My coffee was served quickly and was just right.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Oct 11, 2024~Just so slow. So so slow. Each car should not take that long. I had a mobile order placed 20min before and it still took 5 minutes to get my coffee at the window.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Nov 4, 2023~A bit different experience from other poor reviews, in that the drive-thru line was moving much, much faster than mobile orders. It's been over 30 minutes so far, and `"there are several orders ahead of us`". No manager to speak to, and no real concern with the lack of throughput. More people standing inside than in the drive thru.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Oct 8, 2021~This Starbucks is only a few months old and it does look nice and New with a cool store length couch and outside lounge chairs that are very comfy. They're also open until 9pm vs. most open til 7pm.Barista Travis and Manager Marisa did a superb job making me a happy customer.I rank this a top 10 Starbucks in Phoenix.The only negative is they don't have Wi-Fi yet.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Nov 13, 2023~Great location with fast and friendly service. We always like this location for convenience and consistently great coffee.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Jul 22, 2023~Literally the worst Starbucks in the state. Employees are rude, they take forever (literally 20 minutes in the drive through) ..we got the order wrong and when we told them about it the barista got mad and argued with us, supervisor got involved and he even didn't apologize or tried to make it right
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Jan 22, 2022~Don't go to this Starbucks unless you want to wait 30 minutes in line and still get your drink not well made. We waited 33 minutes for 3 drinks on a 6 car line. Kind of ridiculous. Employees are not well trained in here, we have never got our drinks right when we have come to this location
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Sep 15, 2023~Ryan is the most amazing employee. So friendly and kind. Always has a beautiful smile for us when we arrive. We will continue to visit this location because of him..thank you Ryan
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Sep 3, 2023~This location is busy always in drive thru, which is great! Some days I like to go in and order my coffee and look at the merchandise. 2x this week I have done so and not one person acknowledges me while I stand at the cashier . They are all busy making orders. I have to get back in my car and then order thru drive thru. It's ridiculous. Not even a hello , nothing.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Dec 6, 2021~Customer service = needs improvement.Coffee = needs improvement.At least have one of the two down, you're a coffee shop. No garbages outside on site. Let's litter our Starbucks junk everywhere. I'm not overly thrilled about neighborhood Starbucks. They aren't consistent.Beautiful NEW Starbucks.... It's corporate America.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Mar 11, 2023~Service was terribly slow ordering regular coffee. The interior is very plain and uninspired. Coffee ok.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Feb 16, 2022~I've been coming here at least 3x a week for the past 2 months and they get my order wrong at least 1x a week. Today I ordered a latte and there was NO COFFEE in it. The entire cup was pure foam. And when they get too busy they randomly turn off the mobile ordering option or close the lobby. Not the best way to run a business.Do yourself a favor, go across the street to 32 Shea or Press, unless you have lots of free time to wait in the drive thru to get a $5 cup of foam.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~3~Mar 5, 2023~It's aight. All my shawties fwi, so it's koo. Get a refresher and add vodka and you'll be straight
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Apr 16, 2023~HOT. MESS. Fifteen minute drive thru time and they got both items in my order wrong :/
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Sep 28, 2021~Love this new location! Such easy access from the 51/Shea Blvd exit, and much closer than the PV one, I have only been through the drive-thru, and every time I get a super warm and friendly barista! Love that, love the convenience and The Pumpkin cream cold brew!! So delicious and my Bella's pup-a-cchino!!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~May 9, 2023~Terribly slow drive through-- And not very friendly. Plus they are always out of stuff.  I go only as a last resort!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~1~Sep 20, 2022~Despite numerous terrible experiences at Starbucks I still like their drinks so I was super excited to see a new Starbucks going up so close to home :D I was thinking maybe since this location was new they would bring some seasoned employees from other stores over to help train and operate the business. Boy was I wrong. I've been to this location twice. The first time I waited 15 minutes for a single drink that was not made the right way. The lady at the window was friendly and offered to remake it but I paid for the drink and accepted it anyways to not make a big deal out of it. Before I left her and another employee walked over to another area and got me two $4 gift cards to give to me since my order was wrong and I waited so long. I thought that was super nice, typically Starbucks doesn't give a shit. The next day I decided to give this location another shot and ordered two drinks. When I pulled up to pay I waited over 15 minutes at the window and the same woman working was there, she let me know they were still making the drink. I could see the guy in the car behind me getting agitated since the drive through for a Starbucks shouldn't take more than a couple minutes for just a drink. When I handed her the two gift cards I received the previous day she told me there was nothing on them..... as in they had given me two empty gift cards. I had already decided I was over it and just handed her my debit card to pay instead of arguing with her or reminding her I was the same girl that was there less than 24 hours ago and she had been the one to give me two empty cards. Avoid this store.... The staff are scatterbrained and the drive through takes longer than if you were to go inside.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Oct 15, 2022~I don't usually write reviews but I am really disappointed in the staff at this location. Specifically Kathie. Everytime she is there when I go she is not friendly and impatient. Also a couple times she has messed up my simple order.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Nov 19, 2021~Great new location. Friendly staff makes perfect drinks. Patio and nicely appointed interior.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Apr 13, 2022~Service is always great, really nice partners. My drinks always seem to taste horrible and it's very apparent that they don't shake teas or refreshers. Bar partners might need to go back to the barista basics.
Phoenix, AZ 85028~4~Mar 2, 2022~Everyone that works here has always been so nice to me and always remembers my name and I appreciate that. I haven't had an issue with my coffee but I don't understand why they are closed a lot. I have a gift card very excited to use walk over there and they're closed again before 5pm!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~5~Jan 20, 2022~i went through the drive thru this morning at around 7:15 and the line was crazy long and they had alot of people inside. i am more than happy to wait because everywhere is understaffed right now. i got to the window and the girl who was working (didnt catch her name but she had long brown hair up in a ponytail) was so nice and i had to have my drink remade which i always feel so bad about when they are busy but she made it seem like no big deal and was very sweet. she ended up just giving me the mess up drink and that really made my day! she needs a raise starbucks!!
Phoenix, AZ 85028~2~Apr 16, 2022~drinks are great! cups not so much, lids specifically. second day in a row having my lid come off as soon as i grab my cup. i recommend trying out sturdier lids. thank you.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~5~May 16, 2023~Greetings to fellow travelers and Yelpers.This is by far my # 1 location of Starbucks!I refer to it as My HQ. For 4 1/2 years I have met and had discussions with my people.Originally from Baltimore,Md. ; I relocated to this beautiful part of our Nation on December 18, 2018. This location was not open! In factBoston Markets was the previous tenant.Starbucks started from the ground up! Familyfriendly, lots of kids and grandparents.This morning, I met with one of pastors at my New Church. Pillar Church. 2 Shout Outs, one To pastor Preston Morrison and the other Shout Out to Dr.Phil Goldsberry. Pastor Morrison is very Animated , Bright, Articulate and knows the Word of God. Dr. Phil is a connector of People!I spent an hour with him and he had an Associate contact me. In fact I received an email from Jeff Daigle. Who I introduced myself to this past weekend. Jeff took 90 minutes out of hi as busy schedule to meet meStarbucks is Always busy! The Barista's know how and what I drink . We know each other by name. Feels like my Home away from home.Pictures to follow. You could not ask for a more Professionally trained staff who all go the Extra Mile.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Dec 4, 2021~Every time I have used this Starbucks for my latte I'm always disappointed. They got my order wrong, coffee espresso shots were extremely bitter, no foam on the latte, and too hot. Every time. Will not be going to the Starbucks again they've used all their tries.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~4~Nov 19, 2019~Very pretty and brand new!  Friendly baristas.     I got my usual...Trenta unsweetened iced coffee.  Boring on my part.
Phoenix, AZ 85032~1~Feb 26, 2020~Was a horrible experience. Wasted approximately an hour of my day that I'll never get back. Look for a Starbucks to stop and have a breakfast some coffee and get some email and other computer work web-based completed only to find that the Wi-Fi is less than a trickle. Unacceptable. I will no longer be frequenting Starbucks particularly this location and encourage others who want to use electron a device to stay clear apparently there's two Wi-Fi accounts one for the manager and one for the store and the store is less than a trickle. I asked the employees and they said oh yeah we know. Looking around the Starbucks store no wonder there's no one in the shop. Fact nobody was in here working on the computer and the place is almost vacant is an example of the fact that they're not paying attention to the users and the patrons that frequent their store. Horrible experience at Starbucks 40th St. and Thunderbird.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Sep 26, 2024~Everyone is always so welcoming, friendly, and helpful...been going to this location for about 1 1/2 and I have never had any issues. Always saying hi on a first name basis and remembers orders and extremely timely!
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Dec 24, 2021~I hardly go here but since in the neighborhood shopping decided to stop in. Inside is clean, few tables outside for outdoor seating.  I ordered my usual iced chai tea latte. They look short staffed but i didn't mind waiting. Overall got my order right and would return here.
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jan 9, 2020~So blessed and convenient to have a Starbucks at my workplace. They recently remodeled this Starbucks so it is very nice now. Much needed! Nice open floor plan and seems to be faster and more efficient. Staff is always super nice and always more then welcome to answer questions or recommend a few drinks. Previously they had a lot of staff turn around but seems like lately they have had the same staff which is great. Something I love to see, and I enjoy all the current staff members so if something changed to keep them, keep it up! I love that as employees we get the options to order ahead with Grubhub and pick it up. Makes it great to grab a coffee on break or on our way to a meeting. There is so many drinks I love here. I pretty much love all the fall/Christmas holidays lattes but on a average day I must say iced Carmel macchiato is my fav. I get it melted(mixed) and sub almond milk for a tad healthier option. Not saying this is a healthy drink at all...Lol. They recently recommended I try it with the blonde espresso which was fantastic. The blonde espresso taste smooth and lighter, doesn't seem as strong but it supposedly higher caffeine. Win win I guess, right? Well I'm thankful for this Starbucks. Basically helps me get my work done from 2pm on. Helps me finish the afternoon strong! See you again soon Starbucks, probably late today to be honest..... hehe :)
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jul 26, 2022~It was delicious totally recommend def get the vanilla bean frap if you want to try something new
Phoenix, AZ 85085~2~Oct 8, 2022~When I went to Starbucks today they were out of pretty much every good sandwich I mean they still had my fav frap witch is the Carmel ribon one it's was amazing but ya Starbucks is normally my fav place
Phoenix, AZ 85085~5~Jan 21, 2019~This Starbucks is located in my job and makes it so convenient. I love how quick and efficient they are, making a quick Starbucks run between breaks possible.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Oct 23, 2022~I've been to a lot of Starbucks locations and someare better than others. Some have personality and others are just an empty void and cattleline. The location on Happy Valley Road has a lot of personality and it all starts with Jocelyn.  She's a combination of several characters from the 1980s Cheers TV show.  Jocelyn is part Sam, Carla, and Diane.  Jocelyn knows everybody's name and if you're a regular like Norm or Cliff, and Dr Fraser, your drink is ready before you walk up to the register.  Jocelyn's smile and guffaw can't be missed. It's a bright red and cheery as her current hair color. Megan and the other staff members feed off of her infectious enthusiasm and make this location run like a well oiled machine.  The location is clean and has plenty of seating options indoor and outdoor.  Love the vibe of this location and I'm glad I had a chance to visit.  Maybe one day soon, I'll hear `" Charley!`" when I walk through the front door and be a regular like Cliff and Norm.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 14, 2024~Usually i really enjoy getting my drinks here, not today. I wasn't feeling well today and ordered a honey citrus mint tea aka a medicine ball. I noticed my drink tasted funny, but i brushed it off because I'm sick. Now my stomach is starting to hurt. I take a look at the tea bags tags and it says `"chamomile mint blossom`". I get very bad stomach aches from chamomile. If this happened to someone who is allergic that could have been horrible! I understand if you are out of the tea i want, but they could have at least told me if that was the case!
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Aug 25, 2024~Many of the baristas are friendly and efficient, but some are downright impatient and rude. The woman working the drive-through the morning of 8/25/24 took rudeness to the nth degree. We ordered five items including two beverages. We requested to use our points (balance 781) for the drinks as points were expiring. We had a previous problem with this location charging us and not using points when requested, so had called corporate and been assured everything was fine with our account. This location also has a history of not awarding us points to our account, but they ALWAYS send us a receipt with a request for additional tip. The barista could not redeem our points despite seeing that we had 781 points. She told us that had never happened before, acted like we were trying to pull a fast one, and told us the only thing we could do is pay now and call corporate. We told her we already did and they said everything was fine with our account, so she said we could come in Monday when the manager was there and call corporate in the store. (The call wait time was about 30 minutes btw.) She absolutely refused to honor the points she admitted that she saw we had! She then contradicted herself and said her system didn't register that we had an account, but we were sent a receipt and tip request from our `"non-existent`" account that she scanned. Her attitude and treatment of us as trying to get free stuff was ridiculous! Even with using points, we still would have been spending $15! We paid the full amount (receiving a receipt and tip request but no points), left, and immediately went to another Starbucks across the parking lot in Safeway. Guess what? Absolutely no problem redeeming our points and friendly, lovely service too! We will be using them in the future. This Starbucks is an epic fail when it comes to customer service and care. Minus ten stars really.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jan 16, 2022~I visit this Starbucks 4-10x a week as live nearby. The staff (especially Jocelyn, who works morning) is Super friendly and quickly remembers locals/ repeat customers by name and their drinks. I go early on the weekends and mingle with other locals and their dog(s) that everyone pets, plays with and even sometimes feeds..  We talk local stuff, sports, cars, etc.The mid day and evening crowd can be more quieter with laptops out and working or just relaxing catching up with others in person or over the phone.Drive thru can be stacked up which can cause parking to be tricky. But park to the side or closer to BKs for ease.5 stars; A+ as best Starbucks out of over150+ over 5 countries I've visited.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Nov 26, 2020~In the area and needed a caffeine jolt on Thanksgiving morning. When I arrived at this location there was a long line wrapped around the parking lot. So parked the car and went inside not a customer in sight. I was actually greeted and advise where to go to place order. Once I did I went to pay by my app on the phone. The nice lady behind the counter advised where to go. Every time the app is updated it is different. So she scanned my phone and transaction complete. Also a tall cappuccino was nearly a dollar less  at $3.75 than the last one I visited in South Florida at $4.55. Note prices do vary by location and region. If I blinked my drink was ready! It was hot and delicious. So thankful this Thanksgiving for the wonderful service and kindness shown to me in this location. Definitely will come back here again.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Mar 21, 2024~Service is iffy, i forgot to use my coupon so i got back in line, while i was waiting in line the cashier was helping someone who already ordered and paid for their drink and wanted to use a BOGO coupon, the cashier said she'll push it through even thought the lady already paid, so the lady in line got her 2 drinks, I ordered 3 drinks and when i told the cashier i wanted to use my coupon she said she can't help me, when she had just helped the lady in front of me with the same issue. she didn't offer a logical solution or anything.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Dec 30, 2023~Really nice staff and they are very helpful. If they don't get your drink to your liking they are always willing to fix it without getting upset with you
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Apr 22, 2019~It's your typical Starbucks :) the team seems to work hard and be attentive! This was a drive thru visit and I felt like everything went smooth, I truly have nothing bad to say other than it wasn't a WOW experience. Caitlin in the drive thru was great, she communicated well, had a smile on her face and my drinks were made correctly! We spoke about their new rewards program update for a quick minute and I learned something new- if you save up to 400 points (actually save and not use for free drinks), you could earn a Starbucks cup; so it could go towards actual merchandise which I like!A newer Starbucks opened about 7 minutes down the street so may have taken some of the bulk of the customers that come to this location, but this location has lots of parking, easy access and friendly employees.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~May 5, 2023~If I could rate it zero stars I would, the person in the drive thru taking order (Gia) was the rudest person ever... she does not know how to work with customers, plus she charged me wrong... there's no need to give bad attitude .....
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Dec 25, 2022~This Starbucks is hands down the best! Their staff are amazing I won't name them all because it would take too much time and sadly I would (because my brain ha) forget some and they all deserve to be named they know me and know my order. I'm one of those `"extra`" Boujee Starbucks orders and they are hands down the ONLY Starbucks that makes it right. They go out of their way to greet me and others and even when people are extra rude they keep a smile on their faces. I'm grateful they put up with me and love this one so much! If I ever move I'll have to drag them with me!! I would give them 10 stars if I could!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jan 16, 2022~Jocelyn puts her whole bussy into every coffee she makes. A+ customer service. Alyssa was also an incredible asset, sucks she left, but Jocelyn holds down the fort and makes magic in her drinks. Also, love how dog friendly it is!!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~May 27, 2018~Monday through Friday mornings are a lot like the old Alabama song, `"I'm in a hurry to get things done, I rush and rush until`" , well you get the point.  Typically I'll grab coffee from home, I can make my own Starbucks there, either Keurig or a nice Chemex pour-over. But on many a pleasant Phoenix morning I'll want the real McCoy made by a trained barista.What makes this possible on a `"school day`" is the wonderful Starbucks app. I have my gift cards loaded, my favorites saved (lately an iced americano with a splash of coconut milk, venti of course). I highly recommend the sausage, cheddar and egg sandwich if you need a protein boost. Or you can mix and match by walking across the parking lot to B-KIng for one of those heavenly but horrible crosissandwichs, sausage please.  Guilt but happy.  The app has some sort of gamification to it that if you collect the stars, you earn free stuff.  I'm lucky to remember to check in on Yelp let alone game on my way in to work with my 2 gig memory.While I always grab and dash, (my order is always ready to pick up when I get there) I'd love to sit and chill and people watch or surf the net.  This location has a great vibe to it, sweet patio also.  I love that Starbucks has changed their approach and will allow anyone to use their Facilites even if you're not buying anything.Oh, BTW, speaking of grabbing and dashing, my apologies to whoever ordered the spinach wrap last week and ended up with my breakfast sandwich.  I think you got the better end of the bargain on that one.   Cheers!
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 9, 2023~This Starbucks had great customer service! I had issues with my drinks from another Starbucks and explained what happened to this store and they gave me two free drinks to make up for the problem with my last order from another Starbucks.  Very friendly staff and super clean environment here.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 23, 2018~This is one of the closest Starbucks with a drive thru. Also there is 3 Starbucks just on happy valley less then 5 miles from each other. They have a patio to sit outside with umbrellas! It feels kinda tight inside cause it's kinda small.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~May 19, 2018~I'm not quite sure why this particular location manages to obtain such low reviews.  I've never had any issues here at all.  After dinner this evening, I ran up &amp; got a couple of Frappuccino's for an after dinner treat. I hit up the drive-thru &amp; there was only (2) cars ahead of me.  I read the previous reviews about how slow the drive-thru was prior to heading out to this Starbucks visit.  From the time I spit out my order until the time the nice girl at the drive-thru window handed me my drinks, a whopping 2 minutes and 43 seconds passed.  How do I know that?  ...because I timed it. [insert climatic theme music here]  I guess I'm not personally the kind of individual who feels that's a horrific amount of elapsed time.  Obviously, when it's 7:30 a.m. on a Monday morning and the amount of vehicles in the drive-thru are wrapping around the parking lot into the Safeway gas station - I can't imagine that most of you are blown away that it may take more than 2 minutes and 43 seconds to get your drink.  If by chance you ARE blown away by that fact, perhaps you should stick to brewing your coffee at home.  Just sayin'...Anywho... the interior of this Starbucks location is exceptionally clean.  The restrooms are clean and the Wi-Fi is fast.  None of the staff has ever been rude to me.  I've been inside of this Starbucks numerous times and have been through the drive-thru even more.  The staff has always been friendly, cordial, polite and I've never had an order screwed up in the least.  Like.  Never.  The location is convenient and simple to access.  My only [minor] gripe would be the parking lot situation.  It's fairly cramped, but it's simply due to the sheer volume of surrounding shops and stores in the adjacent strip mall.  When the drive-thru line does get lengthy, there isn't a good place for the vehicles to oozing out of the drive-thru to land.  They essentially spill out into the small parking lot that can land lock the patron's who have parked to go into the location.  But again, if you're attempting to park here on a Monday morning at 7:30 a.m. - well, you're tempting a fate that you already know the answer to.My Frappuccino's this evening were fresh, ice cold &amp; sweet... just like my Yelp reviews.  Just kidding.  Sorta.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jan 9, 2020~Odd Starbucks vibe. The staff are very unfriendly. They seem more interested in talking about customers then actually providing customer service. Ordering a drink takes a bit of patience. I usually have to repeat myself. So much for listening.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Apr 30, 2021~I have never had to wait in line at a drive thru as long as I did here. Holy crow!!  It took 20 min just to PLACE my order. Ugh. I go to Starbucks drive thru because it's usually super quick. What is going on here?!?  This is like IN N OUT. Dang. If the line is around the parking lot, DON'T BOTHER unless you have 45min to kill. Which I do not. And now I can't get out of line. Super frustrating.   This drink better be freaking glorious.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Dec 8, 2016~My go-to Starbucks since I like the drive-thru as well as location. The inside is very clean and a modern/rustic feel. They have a ton of tables inside and outside on small patio which makes it nice to hang out on your computer or a great meeting spot. This Starbucks is always busy especially the drive-thru! The line goes pretty quick but just make sure you give yourself enough time because there is usually at least 10cars in line every morning. The drinks are always good and exactly what I wanted. Everyone is always friendly as well and hyped up on caffeine by 6am. HA!Starbucks prices are pretty high for coffee but that is expected for convenience. I love the holiday drinks &amp; cups but they definitely can get expense. I try to just go 1-2 days a week or stop by to get a refreshing tea as that is fairly cheap. My favorites are Pumpkin Spice Latte, Carmel Macchiato Iced, Cold brew, Carmel Frappuccino, and Green tea.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jul 25, 2019~I'm bummed anytime I give a poor review. This Starbucks In particular has poor customer service. That's always the thing I care most about. Treating others well especially when it's a customer.  Being in the service industry myself that's one of my main focuses!! My sisters and I came for a nice coffee date. There were 5 of us and 3 of the 5 drinks were made wrong. We asked for each drink to be remade and we got no apology. They simply just took the drinks from us and remade it. One of our waters spilled and so we went to the front to get a cloth to clean it and get a new water and we were completely ignored. It was just disappointing that simple customer service wasn't practiced at this location as well as not being able to listen to our orders. I will probably not be returning to this location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Oct 1, 2019~This is the 3rd time I have ordered a pumpkin scone and banana bread from this location and they have been so dry and old. I get them for my grandkids and will not be going back here ever again. It's bad enough they charge 2.95 for a slice of banana bread, at least it could be fresh.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Sep 13, 2016~Stopped by here after work and got a tall double chocolaty chip frap and a chocolate croissant. The drive thru moved quick, it was around 2:30pm and whoever Will is that was working the drive thru... he is awesome! The reason I'm writing this is because he just had positive vibes coming across that little voice box when I was ordering. You can tell he loved what he was doing and that just put a smile on my face. Plus he told me I was in luck today because all desserts were a dollar. YES! (Not sure if it's a usual thing they do, but if so, I wouldn't have guessed because Will made my experience so personal! And what I loved is that he didn't ask me if I wanted my croissant warmed up or not, he just gave it to me warm! Thank you. (Who likes cold croissants with the chocolate chunky??? Not me) AND the best frap I've had so far, I don't know what they did but it was extra good.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jul 6, 2018~Always out of food. Never have the spinach feta wrap after 11 am and then none or few of the follow up choices. My drink is messed up about 50% of the time. I order SF vanilla latte but they make it skinny with nonfat milk even though I order it properly and the label is correct, they still consistently make it wrong. Drive through is always slow and going in is slower. Do t waste your time, go to the Starbucks in Safeway, a little less convenient but worth the walk inside!
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Mar 18, 2018~Worst Starbucks in the valley!!!! Unfortunately, I would come here for convenience. My yoga studio was steps away. The staff are rude, drinks sub-par, pastries like rocks. Honestly, I have been in customer service for years and have never witnessed such nasty attitudes. It's a cup of coffee and a smile. This should not be much to ask for considering the prices  and the very grounds (maybe- pun intended) that Starbucks was founded upon. A great cup of coffee from a friendly community barista. Honestly, if you cannot be consistently pleasant to EVERY customer, perhaps you would be better off not working with the public. I have had to take my drinks from this Starbucks to a different location to have them re-made to make them palatable!!!! I have spoken with the manager and district manager that tell me the problem will be corrected. So far, not so.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Jul 25, 2019~I used to love this Starbucks. Unfortunately, the service has gone down hill. They haven't made my drink correctly in the last three visits and it's only iced tea with no sugar. People make mistakes but it's how they react to them that is very telling. I never receive a free drink, apology and they even act like it's a huge inconvenience to remake it. I don't think I'll be going back to this location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Sep 11, 2012~This is a good Starbucks experience with all the expected amenities of WiFi, good coffee, happy service and some great people watching. However, beware of the cranky barista. Although my mom can be a bit much on the drink customization, that's no need for an eye-roll and huff. I would chalk it up to a bad day (everyone has them, even if they're made in the Starbucks Barista Kitchen, where only happy people are born). However, I've heard her be a bit short and huffy with a few customers. Overall, a great Starbucks in a great location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 19, 2021~11-19-2021 Pulled up in the drive five minutes before closing time was told they were closed. I asked would it be too much to ask for a water. Was told they already shut down the system  I use to be a shift here years ago when we gave customers water. Also your `"system`" has nothing to do with water. Little insider secret, that's not how water works but I appreciate the lie.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 22, 2017~After watching a barista struggle to scrape stuff out of the blender using her hand and a desperate cup, then getting the wrong drink even after I clarified 3 times which one I wanted (basic, simple frappuchino), then when I did get the 'right' drink it looked completely different than what it ALWAYS looks like when I get it from other stores BUT one of the other baristas was condescendingly repeating that was the right drink this time. One of the baristas dumped mocha coated ice back into the main ice bin!The first time it wasn't even the same frappachino, and the guy taking my order said `"umm, ya we have a mocha drink`" when I asked for a dark mocha. Sounded like he had NO IDEA what was on the menu! Nobody bothered to check anything with anyone else either. They acted like I was a nuisance.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jun 30, 2020~Starbucks is a vibe. Starbucks is one of the few public spaces I feel comfortable (currently). Given everything that is going on right now, Starbucks feels like a safe space. Being on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona during this time doesn't feel great for me because most people here are just mad and racist. I sought out Starbucks and I am happy I did. The lady at the window was so welcoming and peaceful; the food/drink was on point; and there was just an air of, for lack of a better descriptor, love. Additionally, they are taking social/physical distancing very seriously. It would be nice if most stores/restaurants/etc. felt this way inside. I generally go to the Starbucks in Noe Valley (San Francisco) and they are very, very nice as well.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~May 27, 2017~I love this location. I have been going to this location for years. Always friendly staff. Drinks are yummy, fast and generally made correctly. Drive thru time is usually the longest wait. I generally mobile order unless I have my kids then I go inside where we enjoy our drinks and snakes. I recommend getting a raspberry mocha. My favorite is the chestnut praline latte but it is seasonal and not till November. Kids usually get frapps.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Oct 21, 2017~This was at the bottom of my iced coffee.  Curdled milk.  Did not notice it until I started to stir with the straw.  This Starbucks location has steadily declined in quality in their product and customer service.  Gross!   Here's hoping I don't get sick from drinking some of it.  Disappointed.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Mar 26, 2020~Leah is amazing here!!!! I called yesterday to ask about free coffee offer for healthcare workers! She confirmed the offer and we all got a cup of coffee for the afternoon to finish our 13 hour shift sharper! Thank you!
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Jan 14, 2015~Thats a bummer that they move the Starbucks over here. :(But I love the drive thru here. Long lines, but it moves quickly.... sometimes. :) it's smaller than usual. Very clean, great bartista here.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Oct 30, 2019~Slowest Starbucks drive through I've ever been to. It's slow every single time I go no matter what time of day. I wait less at chick fil a with 20 cars in front of me than this Starbucks with 2 cars in front of me. You can seriously assume it's about 5-7 minutes per car. They need to change something in the way they do things.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~May 3, 2018~Worst service ever.  Old lady taking orders sure thinks she's here for us.  Like we are a nuisance.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Aug 3, 2018~The worst Starbucks probably in the world. Never have product, and terribly slow. Inside or drive thru, doesn't matter. Always slow. Hire more people and carry the damn turkey bacon sandwich.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Nov 16, 2019~This morning Leah was absolutely terrible. I didn't know they this location was out of pumpkin so I asked for a minute to decide on a different beverage. She kept mentioning the line behind me. I ordered quickly and was taking to the brunette at the window when again Leah chimed in saying no we are just out and we're not getting it back. We weren't even talking about the pumpkin at this point. Extremely rude. Not going back to this location due to the experience with Leah herself.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Jan 6, 2021~I come here every morning and the employees are fantastic!  Great customer service and if there is an issue they are happy to fix it and make your drink the way you want!  New machines have really helped eliminate bitter espresso too!  I am so hopeful they reopen soon!!!  Miss my morning smiles from them!!
Glendale, AZ 85310~4~Mar 18, 2018~Sunday mornings are crazy busy here. Sometimes the line for the drive thru is too much. My last three visits I walk in, get my coffee, and walk out. The best is seeing the same people still in line for drive thru. The store is clean. My coffee is fresh n hot, and the staff are super friendly. Thanks for being my pre-church coffee supply. Keep up the awesome work and fast friendly service.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Mar 25, 2018~Would add a zero if possible! The drive thru line took 45 minutes to get through. The Sunday morning crew must be different than other busy morning crews -- I've always had great experiences on weekday mornings. This team was rude and seemed annoyed. Mobile orders were prioritized, which i don't usually mind, but when your car has been trapped in the drive thru for nearly an hour, it's frustrating to see people pull up, order on their phone, and then go grab their drinks within minutes.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Dec 16, 2017~I'm done with this Starbucks as they have gotten our order wrong too many times now, every other place does a good job I am so confused on why this one has, had so many mishaps with us. We always say iced drinks, this time we got the salted caramel mocha and the mocha macchiato no whip like always and they gave them to us hot. Whatever it is I hope they fix it and maybe I'll give them another shot like last time.
Glendale, AZ 85310~3~Nov 29, 2017~I have been to this Starbucks three times, the third time was because i wanted to give them another chance. The first two times they messed up my orders, luckily the third time was the charm and they got my girlfriend and mines order 100% right. So the first time we went my girlfriends coffee was correct and i had a coconut-milk mocha macchiato (no whip just in case)... I have literally zero idea on what they brought me and it came with whipped cream (another starbucks i went to said that drink doesn't even come with whip). So i said I didn't want whipped, they just took it off and all it tasted like mocha syrup and coffee. Then the second time, decided to spice it up and get a salted caramel mocha. Mine was right this time but my girlfriend got the chestnut praline (again we say no whip incase over and over again to make sure for both of them). Hers came out with whip cream, they were nice about it and remade it for her.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Feb 13, 2019~The vanilla bean frappuccino is my favorite  this Starbucks is always so clean and the service is always speedy quick.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Sep 22, 2020~The customer service here is pretty good but I hate to say if you want a good drink then go to the one up the road in norterra, you can really taste the difference
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Apr 1, 2012~Excellent service. Friendly staff. They always greet me by name. And my drink is made just the way I like it.The drive-thru is for me since I am typically making a run up to Starbucks to grab a morning coffee or an afternoon pick me up and have my three children with me. There is no denying that this is a very busy location with a drive-through that can often span quite a distance, typically the length of one row of parked cars. However, I've always waited regardless since the line seems to still move quite quickly unlike other locations I've been to. The staff doesn't amazing job at managing orders while still making you feel welcome and not rushed!It's also great to see familiar faces when I'm not a daily regular but still I'm treated as one!I believe it's the staff from the previous location about 1 mile south on pinnacle Peak Road. Which that location closed a few years ago and it's nice to still see some of the same barista's working in greeting you from years ago. If you are at Starbucks drinker and I don't have a rewards account with them than my advice would be to get one because the benefits are amazing and include free drinks or pastries etc. I'm not sure the requirements now for the gold card; however back when I joined into thousand 10 I believe it was every 12 purchases and you got a free drink plus other benefits such as free refills on their in-house coffee and teas. I'm not entirely sure now what that for benefits are except that after so many dollars being spent or purchases that you do you earn free drinks as well as various offers and discounts from being a Gold card member. I do want to clarify that this is not a credit card by any means but rather a gift card that you would register into your name and make purchases on that gift card for the points or rewards. The gift cards can be reloaded or refilled.  Which means it is not at all a credit card of sorts but rather a prepaid gift card that is being used for purchases. Because I for one would not be signing up for a credit card just to get some coffee ;-)
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~May 20, 2019~Always come to this location and always get my coffee order wrong. I ask for cream in my coffee and it always looks dark brown like barely any is in it. Every other Starbucks in the valley gets it right except this location. Coffee tastes almost burnt half of the time or they don't fill their drinks all the way. Very disappointed. Not the nicest workers either.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Sep 15, 2017~I rarely go to any Starbucks anymore. The quality of the coffee and the customer service just is not what it used to be but yet the prices are higher. Go figure. This location in particular though has been super disappointing to me the handful of times I've been in. Employees who clearly don't care if you're there or not and espresso based drinks that are bitter tasting and way too expensive. Although it's close to my home, I'm done going there. Will either make my drinks at home or make the longer drive to a Dutch Brothers location.
Glendale, AZ 85310~5~Dec 15, 2016~Robert is a super amazing employee to have their at your Starbucks!! Always has a smile while working through the drive-thru it seems to be a perfect way to start my day!!
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Jul 18, 2015~This is by far, the slowest Starbucks in the country, possibly the world! Even the home shop in Seattle is faster. Wait of average 15min just about 95% of the time.
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Aug 10, 2016~This place have a old lady that gives horrible service,I felt like she's discriminated against Asians, today I went in to order a drink,I said `"purple drink`" 3 times and she make it sound like she didn't understand what I said,I pretty sure I pronounced it right and my friend hear that when I first said it.Every Time I go, in this old lady gives me the worst service ever!
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Sep 2, 2017~Went in for a venti iced coconut milk mocha macchiato and first they made I sloppy and the second time they made it sloppy with so much goop at the bottom I got a mouth full my first sip and they didn't use coconut milk. They have had progressively worse service recently
Glendale, AZ 85310~1~Dec 12, 2019~I have been going to this starbucks every weekday morning for about the last five years. I have seen a lot of change over there over the years. It seems like every since they lost Nancy the business has gotten much slower and the employees do not move very fast at all. I have to wait forever to get my drink even though hardly any customers are there. This morning I ordered a sugar free skinny cinnamon dolce iced latte and the first time it came out it was hot, so then they re-made it and the second time it was iced but not sugar free. I never write reviews but felt that this time it was necessary.
Glendale, AZ 85310~2~Mar 7, 2019~The breakfast sandwiches were gross. And we ordered a puppachino and the said you mean a cup of whipped cream. Just unnecessarily rude. And to top it off we had to ask for it two more times because they kept forgetting.
